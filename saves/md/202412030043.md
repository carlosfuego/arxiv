**Authors**: Gustavo de Veciana, Sonia Fahmy, George Kesidis, Voicu Popescu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:23:25Z

**Summary**: Virtual Reality (VR) applications have a number of unique characteristics that set them apart from traditional video streaming. These characteristics have major implications on the design of VR rendering, adaptation, prefetching, caching, and transport mechanisms. This paper contrasts VR to video streaming, stored 2D video streaming in particular, and discusses how to rethink system and network support for VR.

### KV Shifting Attention Enhances Language Modeling
**Authors**: Mingyu Xu, Wei Cheng, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:42:38Z

**Summary**: The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

### DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and   Verifiable Credentials
**Authors**: Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Dennis Natusch, Artur Philipp, Axel Küpper, Hans Joachim Einsiedler, Daniela Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Ravi Netravali, Yida Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T21:10:20Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching
**Authors**: Xiaofan Niu, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:35:22Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

### Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:42:54Z

**Summary**: We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T12:50:05Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T02:01:50Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:09:29Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines
**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### FastSwitch: Optimizing Context Switching Efficiency in Fairness-aware   Large Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Ao Shen, Zhiyao Li, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T15:07:28Z

**Summary**: Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

### Accelerating Vision Diffusion Transformers with Skip Branches
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T14:43:46Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.git.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T08:21:47Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### A Method for Building Large Language Models with Predefined KV Cache   Capacity
**Authors**: Zhonghua Yi, Ge Niu, Lei Wang, Wei Tang, Liqiu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T03:07:20Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

### Attamba: Attending To Multi-Token States
**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Safeen Huda, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:52:06Z

**Summary**: When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

### STAR: Synthesis of Tailored Architectures
**Authors**: Armin W. Thomas, Rom Parnichkun, Alexander Amini, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:42:42Z

**Summary**: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T17:28:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### Degrees of Freedom of Cache-Aided Interference Channels Assisted by   Active Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces
**Authors**: Abolfazl Changizi, Ali H. Abdollahi Bafghi, Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T16:21:10Z

**Summary**: This paper studies cache-aided wireless networks in the presence of active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided wireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement, delivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable scheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side information), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the network's parameters. We derive the achievable one-shot sum-DoF for different sizes of cache memories, network configurations, and numbers of IRS elements. Our results highlight the potential of deploying an IRS in cache-aided wireless communication systems, underscoring the enhancement of achievable DoF for various parameter regimes, particularly when the sizes of the caches (especially at the transmitters) are inadequate. Notably, we show that access to an IRS with a sufficient number of elements enables the achievement of the maximum possible DoF for various parameter regimes of interest.

### DreamCache: Finetuning-Free Lightweight Personalized Image Generation   via Feature Caching
**Authors**: Emanuele Aiello, Umberto Michieli, Diego Valsesia, Mete Ozay, Enrico Magli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T15:03:14Z

**Summary**: Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T05:10:04Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy.

### Efficient LLM Inference with I/O-Aware Partial KV Cache Recomputation
**Authors**: Chaoyi Jiang, Lei Gao, Hossein Entezari Zarch, Murali Annavaram

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T04:03:14Z

**Summary**: Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### Ca2-VDM: Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion Model with Causal   Generation and Cache Sharing
**Authors**: Kaifeng Gao, Jiaxin Shi, Hanwang Zhang, Chunping Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T13:33:41Z

**Summary**: With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T12:14:33Z

**Summary**: Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.   We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

### Deegen: A JIT-Capable VM Generator for Dynamic Languages
**Authors**: Haoran Xu, Fredrik Kjolstad

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T21:57:29Z

**Summary**: Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

### Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM   Inference Environments
**Authors**: Nikoleta Iliakopoulou, Jovan Stojkovic, Chloe Alverti, Tianyin Xu, Hubertus Franke, Josep Torrellas

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T16:20:57Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Baoshun Tong, Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T06:43:38Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) has attracted increasing attention for tackling the issue of distribution shift during the test phase. While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time. Code will be available at https://github.com/BaoshunWq/clip-TAEA.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T22:11:42Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

### TASER: Temporal Adaptive Sampling for Fast and Accurate Dynamic Graph   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Gangda Deng, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng, Yinglong Xia, Christopher Leung, Jianbo Li, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T10:42:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

### HRSAM: Efficient Interactive Segmentation in High-Resolution Images
**Authors**: You Huang, Wenbin Lai, Jiayi Ji, Liujuan Cao, Shengchuan Zhang, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T01:44:00Z

**Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.

### Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation of Liver Domes in kV Triggered   Images for Online Breath-hold Reproducibility Verification of Liver   Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
**Authors**: Sugandima Weragoda, Ping Xia, Kevin Stephans, Neil Woody, Michael Martens, Robert Brown, Bingqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T19:30:40Z

**Summary**: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.

### AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out   Context Attribution
**Authors**: Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Colin Raffel

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T18:06:14Z

**Summary**: The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T15:55:19Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for   Scalable Recommendation System
**Authors**: Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:55:43Z

**Summary**: The model size growth of personalized recommendation systems poses new challenges for inference. Weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed for size reduction, but they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) enhanced the model throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but such algorithms introduce massive CPU-PIM communication into prior PIM systems. We propose ProactivePIM, a PIM system for weight-sharing recommendation system acceleration. ProactivePIM integrates a cache within the PIM with a prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate communication overhead through a subtable mapping strategy. ProactivePIM achieves a 4.8x speedup compared to prior works.

### Static Reuse Profile Estimation for Array Applications
**Authors**: Abdur Razzak, Atanu Barai, Nandakishore Santhi, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:26:57Z

**Summary**: Reuse distance analysis is a widely recognized method for application characterization that illustrates cache locality. Although there are various techniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is both time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory traces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a promisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without running the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static analysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an input program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the execution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory accesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a recursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a separate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a temporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller profiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We use this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our model can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to the dynamic reuse profile methods.

### Retrieval-Enhanced Visual Prompt Learning for Few-shot Classification
**Authors**: Jintao Rong, Hao Chen, Linlin Ou, Tianxiao Chen, Xinyi Yu, Yifan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T04:12:53Z

**Summary**: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has been widely used in various downstream vision tasks. The few-shot learning paradigm has been widely adopted to augment its capacity for these tasks. However, current paradigms may struggle with fine-grained classification, such as satellite image recognition, due to widening domain gaps. To address this limitation, we propose retrieval-enhanced visual prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache and reuse the knowledge of downstream tasks. RePrompt constructs a retrieval database from either training examples or external data if available, and uses a retrieval mechanism to enhance multiple stages of a simple prompt learning baseline, thus narrowing the domain gap. During inference, our enhanced model can reference similar samples brought by retrieval to make more accurate predictions. A detailed analysis reveals that retrieval helps to improve the distribution of late features, thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks. Reprompt attains state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision datasets, including 11 image datasets, 3 video datasets, 1 multi-view dataset, and 4 domain generalization benchmarks.

### InstCache: A Predictive Cache for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Longwei Zou, Tingfeng Liu, Kai Chen, Jiangang Kong, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:52:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life. However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.

### WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Aobo Liang, Yan Sun, Nadra Guizani

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:34:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.

**Authors**: Stan Loosmore, Alexander Titus

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T02:15:52Z

**Summary**: Modern day Language Models see extensive use in text classification, yet this comes at significant computational cost. Compute-effective classification models are needed for low-resource environments, most notably on edge devices. We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:51:25Z

**Summary**: We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.

### MAS-Attention: Memory-Aware Stream Processing for Attention Acceleration   on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mohammadali Shakerdargah, Shan Lu, Chao Gao, Di Niu

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:44:26Z

**Summary**: The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.

### A Distributed-memory Tridiagonal Solver Based on a Specialised Data   Structure Optimised for CPU and GPU Architectures
**Authors**: Semih Akkurt, Sébastien Lemaire, Paul Bartholomew, Sylvain Laizet

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T18:31:39Z

**Summary**: Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.

**Authors**: Marco Barbisan, Marco Boldrin, Luca Cinnirella, Bruno Laterza, Alberto Maistrello, Lionello Marrelli, Federico Molon, Simone Peruzzo, Cesare Taliercio, Marco Valisa, Enrico Zampiva

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T14:52:36Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T02:04:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field. Links to the papers mentioned in this review can be found in our Github Repo https://github.com/zcli-charlie/Awesome-KV-Cache.

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T18:24:03Z

**Summary**: In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.

### An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor   decompositions for Bayesian inversion
**Authors**: Vitalii Aksenov, Martin Eigel

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T11:40:56Z

**Summary**: The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

### Adaptive Cache Management for Complex Storage Systems Using   CNN-LSTM-Based Spatiotemporal Prediction
**Authors**: Xiaoye Wang, Xuan Li, Linji Wang, Tingyi Ruan, Pochun Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T01:55:26Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

### Bi-Mamba: Towards Accurate 1-Bit State Space Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Liqun Ma, Haonan Li, Mingjie Sun, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T18:59:15Z

**Summary**: The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T17:08:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

### Accelerating spherical K-means clustering for large-scale sparse   document data
**Authors**: Kazuo Aoyama, Kazumi Saito

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T05:50:58Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

### Unveiling Redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs): A Systematic   Study
**Authors**: Xibo Sun, Jiarui Fang, Aoyu Li, Jinzhe Pan

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:49:23Z

**Summary**: The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/xdit-project/DiTCacheAnalysis.

### LSMGraph: A High-Performance Dynamic Graph Storage System with   Multi-Level CSR
**Authors**: Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Qian Tao, Sijie Shen, Yanfeng Zhang, Wenyuan Yu, Pengxi Liu, Zhixin Zhang, Hongfu Li, Xiaojian Luo, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:10:28Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

### KV-Tandem -- a Modular Approach to Building High-Speed LSM Storage   Engines
**Authors**: Edward Bortnikov, Michael Azran, Asa Bornstein, Shmuel Dashevsky, Dennis Huang, Omer Kepten, Michael Pan, Gali Sheffi, Moshe Twitto, Tamar Weiss Orzech, Idit Keidar, Guy Gueta, Roey Maor, Niv Dayan

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T14:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present~\emph{KV-Tandem}, a modular architecture for building LSM-based storage engines on top of simple, non-ordered persistent key-value stores (KVSs). KV-Tandem enables advanced functionalities such as range queries and snapshot reads, while maintaining the native KVS performance for random reads and writes. Its modular design offers better performance trade-offs compared to previous KV-separation solutions, which struggle to decompose the monolithic LSM structure. Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T12:56:16Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### I Know What You Sync: Covert and Side Channel Attacks on File Systems   via syncfs
**Authors**: Cheng Gu, Yicheng Zhang, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T20:40:08Z

**Summary**: Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

### Efficient Encoder-Decoder Transformer Decoding for Decomposable Tasks
**Authors**: Bo-Ru Lu, Nikita Haduong, Chien-Yu Lin, Hao Cheng, Noah A. Smith, Mari Ostendorf

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T20:39:46Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.

### Multi-Stage Vision Token Dropping: Towards Efficient Multimodal Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Ting Liu, Liangtao Shi, Richang Hong, Yue Hu, Quanjun Yin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T13:45:33Z

**Summary**: The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/liuting20/MustDrop}.

### Learning-to-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Layer Caching
**Authors**: Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Michael Bi Mi, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T07:43:28Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T01:39:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### Can Increasing the Hit Ratio Hurt Cache Throughput? (Long Version)
**Authors**: Ziyue Qiu, Juncheng Yang, Mor Harchol-Balter

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T22:37:48Z

**Summary**: Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

**Summary**: Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

### SmoothCache: A Universal Inference Acceleration Technique for Diffusion   Transformers
**Authors**: Joseph Liu, Joshua Geddes, Ziyu Guo, Haomiao Jiang, Mahesh Kumar Nandwana

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:24:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:25:54Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Skew-Symmetric Matrix Decompositions on Shared-Memory Architectures
**Authors**: Ishna Satyarth, Chao Yin, RuQing G. Xu, Devin A. Matthews

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:37:31Z

**Summary**: The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra (DLA), particularly in comparison to that of symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. A motivating example is the factorization $X=LTL^T$ of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, which is used in practical applications as a means of determining the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, for example in fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Such applications also often require pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. In this work we explore a combination of known literature algorithms and new algorithms recently derived using formal methods. High-performance parallel CPU implementations are created, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides high-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We find that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via parallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for obtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear and close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing performance.

### Edge Caching Optimization with PPO and Transfer Learning for Dynamic   Environments
**Authors**: Farnaz Niknia, Ping Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T21:01:29Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T17:46:04Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state drains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### Architectural Exploration of Application-Specific Resonant SRAM   Compute-in-Memory (rCiM)
**Authors**: Dhandeep Challagundla, Ignatius Bezzam, Riadul Islam

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:01:05Z

**Summary**: While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.

**Authors**: Hanjiang Wu, Huan Xu, Joongun Park, Jesmin Jahan Tithi, Fabio Checconi, Jordi Wolfson-Pou, Fabrizio Petrini, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T14:28:31Z

**Summary**: Influence Maximization (IM) is vital in viral marketing and biological network analysis for identifying key influencers. Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.

### MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory   Augmentation and Scalable Complexity
**Authors**: Xiao Lv, Jiangxia Cao, Shijie Guan, Xiaoyou Zhou, Zhiguang Qi, Yaqiang Zang, Ming Li, Ben Wang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T13:22:41Z

**Summary**: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

### Pie: Pooling CPU Memory for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yi Xu, Ziming Mao, Xiangxi Mo, Shu Liu, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T09:50:41Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of LLMs has revolutionized natural language processing and AI analysis, but their increasing size and memory demands present significant challenges. A common solution is to spill over to CPU memory; however, traditional GPU-CPU memory swapping often results in higher latency and lower throughput.   This paper introduces Pie, an LLM inference framework that addresses these challenges with performance-transparent swapping and adaptive expansion. By leveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern hardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent data swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective memory without added latency. Adaptive expansion dynamically adjusts CPU memory allocation based on real-time information, optimizing memory usage and performance under varying conditions.   Pie maintains low computation latency, high throughput, and high elasticity. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Pie achieves optimal swapping policy during cache warmup and effectively balances increased memory capacity with negligible impact on computation. With its extended capacity, Pie outperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally, Pie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same performance. Compared to FlexGen, an offline profiling-based swapping solution, Pie achieves magnitudes lower latency and 9.4X higher throughput.

### Pkd-tree: Parallel $k$d-tree with Batch Updates
**Authors**: Ziyang Men, Zheqi Shen, Yan Gu, Yihan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T08:25:31Z

**Summary**: The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

### Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with   Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning
**Authors**: Yu Fu, Zefan Cai, Abedelkadir Asi, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T01:56:11Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.Codes are available at https://github.com/FYYFU/HeadKV

### Joint Model Caching and Resource Allocation in Generative AI-Enabled   Wireless Edge Networks
**Authors**: Zhang Liu, Hongyang Du, Lianfen Huang, Zhibin Gao, Dusit Niyato

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T15:07:15Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AIGC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.

### A Novel Extensible Simulation Framework for CXL-Enabled Systems
**Authors**: Yuda An, Shushu Yi, Bo Mao, Qiao Li, Mingzhe Zhang, Ke Zhou, Nong Xiao, Guangyu Sun, Xiaolin Wang, Yingwei Luo, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T03:28:44Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) serves as a rising industry standard, delivering high-speed cache-coherent links to a variety of devices, including host CPUs, computational accelerators, and memory devices. It is designed to promote system scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data transmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has brought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing, device-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the limited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL, earlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote NUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in accurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in hardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology and PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL simulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation framework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to accurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the ground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections within a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to carry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we thoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system topology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics, leading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance CXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3.

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Data pre-processing pipelines are the bread and butter of any successful AI project. We introduce a novel programming model for pipelines in a data lakehouse, allowing users to interact declaratively with assets in object storage. Motivated by real-world industry usage patterns, we exploit these new abstractions with a columnar and differential cache to maximize iteration speed for data scientists, who spent most of their time in pre-processing - adding or removing features, restricting or relaxing time windows, wrangling current or older datasets. We show how the new cache works transparently across programming languages, schemas and time windows, and provide preliminary evidence on its efficiency on standard data workloads.

### SKVQ: Sliding-window Key and Value Cache Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Haojie Duanmu, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Jiangfei Duan, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T08:18:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.

### Leveraging Previous Steps: A Training-free Fast Solver for Flow   Diffusion
**Authors**: Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T08:17:15Z

**Summary**: Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

### WDMoE: Wireless Distributed Mixture of Experts for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Xiaodong Xu, Liang Qian, Shuguang Cui, Wenjun Zhang, Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T02:48:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but the role of wireless networks in supporting LLMs has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed Mixture of Experts (WDMoE) architecture to enable collaborative deployment of LLMs across edge servers at the base station (BS) and mobile devices in wireless networks. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This deployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on mobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching resources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for WDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To minimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert selection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover, we build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the effectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the latency without compromising LLM performance.

### Anchor Attention, Small Cache: Code Generation with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Xiangyu Zhang, Yu Zhou, Guang Yang, Harald C. Gall, Taolue Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T02:47:05Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated code generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has hindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common strategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV) states from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by mainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations, but brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use sparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or hallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the attention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical study, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at specific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach, AnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and compress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling cross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition caused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently achieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while preserving the majority of model's performance.

### An Efficient Memory Module for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Dong Li, Aijia Zhang, Junqi Gao, Biqing Qi

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T01:53:14Z

**Summary**: Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation learning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels for node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This makes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods typically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory and perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory consumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and maintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes of learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these prototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the cached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation Adaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype, reducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate. When a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant probabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back into the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the model's memory.

**Authors**: Amy Yang, Jingyi Yang, Aya Ibrahim, Xinfeng Xie, Bangsheng Tang, Grigory Sizov, Jeremy Reizenstein, Jongsoo Park, Jianyu Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T23:04:12Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

### GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for   Dynamic Graph Processing
**Authors**: Hongfu Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

### Ada-VE: Training-Free Consistent Video Editing Using Adaptive Motion   Prior
**Authors**: Tanvir Mahmud, Mustafa Munir, Radu Marculescu, Diana Marculescu

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T10:08:37Z

**Summary**: Video-to-video synthesis poses significant challenges in maintaining character consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and preserving visual quality during fast motion. While recent fully cross-frame self-attention mechanisms have improved character consistency across multiple frames, they come with high computational costs and often include redundant operations, especially for videos with higher frame rates. To address these inefficiencies, we propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that selectively reduces redundant computations. This enables a greater number of cross-frame attentions over more frames within the same computational budget, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal coherence. Our method leverages optical flow to focus on moving regions while sparsely attending to stationary areas, allowing for the joint editing of more frames without increasing computational demands. Traditional frame interpolation techniques struggle with motion blur and flickering in intermediate frames, which compromises visual fidelity. To mitigate this, we introduce KV-caching for jointly edited frames, reusing keys and values across intermediate frames to preserve visual quality and maintain temporal consistency throughout the video. With our adaptive cross-frame self-attention approach, we achieve a threefold increase in the number of keyframes processed compared to existing methods, all within the same computational budget as fully cross-frame attention baselines. This results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy and temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/tanvir-utexas/AdaVE/tree/main

### EcoServe: Maximizing Multi-Resource Utilization with SLO Guarantees in   LLM Serving
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T05:12:51Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EcoServe. EcoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EcoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EcoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance. Code is available at https://github.com/UtkarshSaxena1/EigenAttn.

### AcceLLM: Accelerating LLM Inference using Redundancy for Load Balancing   and Data Locality
**Authors**: Ilias Bournias, Lukas Cavigelli, Georgios Zacharopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:24:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference on large-scale systems is expected to dominate future cloud infrastructures. Efficient LLM inference in cloud environments with numerous AI accelerators is challenging, necessitating extensive optimizations for optimal performance. Current systems batch prefill and decoding to boost throughput but encounter latency issues, while others disaggregate these phases, leading to resource underutilization. We propose AcceLLM, a novel method addressing latency and load balancing, inspired by the cache data management. It strategically utilizes redundant data to enhance inference via load balancing and optimal hardware use. Simulated evaluations on Nvidia H100 GPU and Huawei Ascend 910B2 show AcceLLM surpasses state-of-the-art systems up to 30% in latency and efficiency, handling diverse workloads effectively.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:21:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT (Radford et al., 2019), have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling sophisticated natural language understanding and generation. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique reduces operational costs and improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### Loki: Low-rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, Soheil Feizi, Abhinav Bhatele

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T18:58:50Z

**Summary**: Inference on large language models (LLMs) can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in LLM inference contributes significantly to these costs, which has sparked an interest in approximating the self-attention computation to reduce such costs. In this work, we propose to approximate self-attention by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to speed up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs while maintaining the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.

### BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T18:41:50Z

**Summary**: Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

### Adaptive Caching for Faster Video Generation with Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Kumara Kahatapitiya, Haozhe Liu, Sen He, Ding Liu, Menglin Jia, Chenyang Zhang, Michael S. Ryoo, Tian Xie

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T17:06:32Z

**Summary**: Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

### JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T14:59:44Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

**Authors**: Qijie Wang, Guandu Liu, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T09:33:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language foundational models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated significant strides in zero-shot classification. However, the extensive parameterization of models like CLIP necessitates a resource-intensive fine-tuning process. In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/WLuLi/CapS-Adapter.

### HEXA-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware MoE Acceleration with ZERO   Computation Redundancy
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T06:40:40Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

### Reducing Hyperparameter Tuning Costs in ML, Vision and Language Model   Training Pipelines via Memoization-Awareness
**Authors**: Abdelmajid Essofi, Ridwan Salahuddeen, Munachiso Nwadike, Elnura Zhalieva, Kun Zhang, Eric Xing, Willie Neiswanger, Qirong Ho

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T07:53:04Z

**Summary**: The training or fine-tuning of machine learning, vision, and language models is often implemented as a pipeline: a sequence of stages encompassing data preparation, model training and evaluation. In this paper, we exploit pipeline structures to reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning for model training/fine-tuning, which is particularly valuable for language models given their high costs in GPU-days. We propose a "memoization-aware" Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, EEIPU, that works in tandem with a pipeline caching system, allowing it to evaluate significantly more hyperparameter candidates per GPU-day than other tuning algorithms. The result is better-quality hyperparameters in the same amount of search time, or equivalently, reduced search time to reach the same hyperparameter quality. In our benchmarks on machine learning (model ensembles), vision (convolutional architecture) and language (T5 architecture) pipelines, we compare EEIPU against recent BO algorithms: EEIPU produces an average of $103\%$ more hyperparameter candidates (within the same budget), and increases the validation metric by an average of $108\%$ more than other algorithms (where the increase is measured starting from the end of warm-up iterations).

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T07:12:55Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### HOBBIT: A Mixed Precision Expert Offloading System for Fast MoE   Inference
**Authors**: Peng Tang, Jiacheng Liu, Xiaofeng Hou, Yifei Pu, Jing Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Chao Li, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T01:49:45Z

**Summary**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering enhanced capabilities with reduced inference costs. However, deploying MoE-based LLMs on memoryconstrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial memory requirements. While existing expertoffloading methods alleviate the memory requirements, they often incur significant expert-loading costs or compromise model accuracy. We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert offloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key insight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low precision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while preserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that map the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert loading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and (3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations fully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing HOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate its performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models. The results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding compared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.

### Wireless Edge Content Broadcast via Integrated Terrestrial and   Non-terrestrial Networks
**Authors**: Feng Wang, Giovanni Geraci, Lingxiang Li, Peng Wang, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T08:34:44Z

**Summary**: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T07:56:24Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle longer contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as cross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### DroidSpeak: Enhancing Cross-LLM Communication
**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Esha Choukse, Shan Lu, Junchen Jiang, Madan Musuvathi

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T05:41:41Z

**Summary**: In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.   We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.

 ### T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image is the Catalyst for   Video-LLMs
**Authors**: Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Yunhang Shen, Chunjiang Ge, Yan Yang, Zuwei Long, Yuhan Dai, Tong Xu, Xing Sun, Ran He, Caifeng Shan, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:59:54Z

**Summary**: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data. The code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.

### Critical Tokens Matter: Token-Level Contrastive Estimation Enhence LLM's   Reasoning Capability
**Authors**: Zicheng Lin, Tian Liang, Jiahao Xu, Xing Wang, Ruilin Luo, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Yujiu Yang, Zhaopeng Tu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:58:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.

### Transfer Learning for High-dimensional Quantile Regression with   Distribution Shift
**Authors**: Ruiqi Bai, Yijiao Zhang, Hanbo Yang, Zhongyi Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:49:55Z

**Summary**: Information from related source studies can often enhance the findings of a target study. However, the distribution shift between target and source studies can severely impact the efficiency of knowledge transfer. In the high-dimensional regression setting, existing transfer approaches mainly focus on the parameter shift. In this paper, we focus on the high-dimensional quantile regression with knowledge transfer under three types of distribution shift: parameter shift, covariate shift, and residual shift. We propose a novel transferable set and a new transfer framework to address the above three discrepancies. Non-asymptotic estimation error bounds and source detection consistency are established to validate the availability and superiority of our method in the presence of distribution shift. Additionally, an orthogonal debiased approach is proposed for statistical inference with knowledge transfer, leading to sharper asymptotic results. Extensive simulation results as well as real data applications further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed procedure.

### SIMS: Simulating Human-Scene Interactions with Real World Script   Planning
**Authors**: Wenjia Wang, Liang Pan, Zhiyang Dou, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Yuke Lou, Lei Yang, Jingbo Wang, Taku Komura

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:36:15Z

**Summary**: Simulating long-term human-scene interaction is a challenging yet fascinating task. Previous works have not effectively addressed the generation of long-term human scene interactions with detailed narratives for physics-based animation. This paper introduces a novel framework for the planning and controlling of long-horizon physical plausible human-scene interaction. On the one hand, films and shows with stylish human locomotions or interactions with scenes are abundantly available on the internet, providing a rich source of data for script planning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate logical storylines.   This motivates us to marry the two by using an LLM-based pipeline to extract scripts from videos, and then employ LLMs to imitate and create new scripts, capturing complex, time-series human behaviors and interactions with environments. By leveraging this, we utilize a dual-aware policy that achieves both language comprehension and scene understanding to guide character motions within contextual and spatial constraints. To facilitate training and evaluation, we contribute a comprehensive planning dataset containing diverse motion sequences extracted from real-world videos and expand them with large language models. We also collect and re-annotate motion clips from existing kinematic datasets to enable our policy learn diverse skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and its generalization ability to various scenarios, showing remarkably enhanced performance compared with existing methods. Our code and data will be publicly available soon.

### DROID-Splat: Combining end-to-end SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Christian Homeyer, Leon Begiristain, Christoph Schnörr

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:31:24Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in scene synthesis makes standalone SLAM systems purely based on optimizing hyperprimitives with a Rendering objective possible. However, the tracking performance still lacks behind traditional and end-to-end SLAM systems. An optimal trade-off between robustness, speed and accuracy has not yet been reached, especially for monocular video. In this paper, we introduce a SLAM system based on an end-to-end Tracker and extend it with a Renderer based on recent 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques. Our framework \textbf{DroidSplat} achieves both SotA tracking and rendering results on common SLAM benchmarks. We implemented multiple building blocks of modern SLAM systems to run in parallel, allowing for fast inference on common consumer GPU's. Recent progress in monocular depth prediction and camera calibration allows our system to achieve strong results even on in-the-wild data without known camera intrinsics. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ChenHoy/DROID-Splat}.

### Another look at inference after prediction
**Authors**: Jessica Gronsbell, Jianhui Gao, Yaqi Shi, Zachary R. McCaw, David Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:12:50Z

**Summary**: Prediction-based (PB) inference is increasingly used in applications where the outcome of interest is difficult to obtain, but its predictors are readily available. Unlike traditional inference, PB inference performs statistical inference using a partially observed outcome and a set of covariates by leveraging a prediction of the outcome generated from a machine learning (ML) model. Motwani and Witten (2023) recently revisited two innovative PB inference approaches for ordinary least squares. They found that the method proposed by Wang et al. (2020) yields a consistent estimator for the association of interest when the ML model perfectly captures the underlying regression function. Conversely, the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method proposed by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) yields valid inference regardless of the model's accuracy. In this paper, we study the statistical efficiency of the PPI estimator. Our analysis reveals that a more efficient estimator, proposed 25 years ago by Chen and Chen (2000), can be obtained by simply adding a weight to the PPI estimator. We also contextualize PB inference with methods from the economics and statistics literature dating back to the 1960s. Our extensive theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the Chen and Chen (CC) estimator offers a balance between robustness to ML model specification and statistical efficiency, making it the preferred choice for use in practice.

### Classical and Quantum Algorithms for the Deterministic L-system   Inductive Inference Problem
**Authors**: Ali Lotfi, Ian McQuillan, Steven Rayan

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:11:39Z

**Summary**: L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a hugely time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.

### PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains
**Authors**: Vedant Khandelwal, Amit Sheth, Forest Agostinelli

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:52:39Z

**Summary**: Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains. While recent advancements have leveraged generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for domain creation, these efforts have predominantly focused on translating existing domains from natural language descriptions rather than generating novel ones. In contrast, the concept of domain randomization, which has been highly effective in reinforcement learning, enhances performance and generalizability by training on a diverse array of randomized new domains. Inspired by this success, our tool, PDDLFuse, aims to bridge this gap in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDLFuse is designed to generate new, diverse planning domains that can be used to validate new planners or test foundational planning models. We have developed methods to adjust the domain generators parameters to modulate the difficulty of the domains it generates. This adaptability is crucial as existing domain-independent planners often struggle with more complex problems. Initial tests indicate that PDDLFuse efficiently creates intricate and varied domains, representing a significant advancement over traditional domain generation methods and making a contribution towards planning research.

### LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference   A!acks leveraging internal LLM states
**Authors**: Luis Ibanez-Lissen, Lorena Gonzalez-Manzano, Jose Maria de Fuentes, Nicolas Anciaux, Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:38:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.

### AIDetx: a compression-based method for identification of   machine-learning generated text
**Authors**: Leonardo Almeida, Pedro Rodrigues, Diogo Magalhães, Armando J. Pinho, Diogo Pratas

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:31:42Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces AIDetx, a novel method for detecting machine-generated text using data compression techniques. Traditional approaches, such as deep learning classifiers, often suffer from high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a compression-based classification framework that leverages finite-context models (FCMs). AIDetx constructs distinct compression models for human-written and AI-generated text, classifying new inputs based on which model achieves a higher compression ratio. We evaluated AIDetx on two benchmark datasets, achieving F1 scores exceeding 97% and 99%, respectively, highlighting its high accuracy. Compared to current methods, such as large language models (LLMs), AIDetx offers a more interpretable and computationally efficient solution, significantly reducing both training time and hardware requirements (e.g., no GPUs needed). The full implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/AIDetx/AIDetx.

### Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners
**Authors**: Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zifeng Wang, Hamid Palangi, Rujun Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Long Le, Vincent Perot, Swaroop Mishra, Mohit Bansal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:27:05Z

**Summary**: Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

### Cross-Domain Recommendation Meets Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ajay Krishna Vajjala, Dipak Meher, Ziwei Zhu, David S. Rosenblum

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:25:00Z

**Summary**: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution to the cold-start problem, faced by single-domain recommender systems. However, existing CDR models rely on complex neural architectures, large datasets, and significant computational resources, making them less effective in data-scarce scenarios or when simplicity is crucial. In this work, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and explore their performance in the CDR domain across multiple domain pairs. We introduce two novel prompt designs tailored for CDR and demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted effectively, outperform state-of-the-art CDR baselines across various metrics and domain combinations in the rating prediction and ranking tasks. This work bridges the gap between LLMs and recommendation systems, showcasing their potential as effective cross-domain recommenders.

### Multi-label Sequential Sentence Classification via Large Language Model
**Authors**: Mengfei Lan, Lecheng Zheng, Shufan Ming, Halil Kilicoglu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:18:49Z

**Summary**: Sequential sentence classification (SSC) in scientific publications is crucial for supporting downstream tasks such as fine-grained information retrieval and extractive summarization. However, current SSC methods are constrained by model size, sequence length, and single-label setting. To address these limitations, this paper proposes LLM-SSC, a large language model (LLM)-based framework for both single- and multi-label SSC tasks. Unlike previous approaches that employ small- or medium-sized language models, the proposed framework utilizes LLMs to generate SSC labels through designed prompts, which enhance task understanding by incorporating demonstrations and a query to describe the prediction target. We also present a multi-label contrastive learning loss with auto-weighting scheme, enabling the multi-label classification task. To support our multi-label SSC analysis, we introduce and release a new dataset, biorc800, which mainly contains unstructured abstracts in the biomedical domain with manual annotations. Experiments demonstrate LLM-SSC's strong performance in SSC under both in-context learning and task-specific tuning settings. We release biorc800 and our code at: https://github.com/ScienceNLP-Lab/LLM-SSC.

### Bias-inducing geometries: an exactly solvable data model with fairness   implications
**Authors**: Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Federica Gerace, Negar Rostamzadeh, Luca Saglietti

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:12:44Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) may be oblivious to human bias but it is not immune to its perpetuation. Marginalisation and iniquitous group representation are often traceable in the very data used for training, and may be reflected or even enhanced by the learning models. In the present work, we aim at clarifying the role played by data geometry in the emergence of ML bias. We introduce an exactly solvable high-dimensional model of data imbalance, where parametric control over the many bias-inducing factors allows for an extensive exploration of the bias inheritance mechanism. Through the tools of statistical physics, we analytically characterise the typical properties of learning models trained in this synthetic framework and obtain exact predictions for the observables that are commonly employed for fairness assessment. Despite the simplicity of the data model, we retrace and unpack typical unfairness behaviour observed on real-world datasets. We also obtain a detailed analytical characterisation of a class of bias mitigation strategies. We first consider a basic loss-reweighing scheme, which allows for an implicit minimisation of different unfairness metrics, and quantify the incompatibilities between some existing fairness criteria. Then, we consider a novel mitigation strategy based on a matched inference approach, consisting in the introduction of coupled learning models. Our theoretical analysis of this approach shows that the coupled strategy can strike superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs.

### A Riemannian Framework for Learning Reduced-order Lagrangian Dynamics
**Authors**: Katharina Friedl, Noémie Jaquier, Jens Lundell, Tamim Asfour, Danica Kragic

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:02:31Z

**Summary**: By incorporating physical consistency as inductive bias, deep neural networks display increased generalization capabilities and data efficiency in learning nonlinear dynamic models. However, the complexity of these models generally increases with the system dimensionality, requiring larger datasets, more complex deep networks, and significant computational effort. We propose a novel geometric network architecture to learn physically-consistent reduced-order dynamic parameters that accurately describe the original high-dimensional system behavior. This is achieved by building on recent advances in model-order reduction and by adopting a Riemannian perspective to jointly learn a non-linear structure-preserving latent space and the associated low-dimensional dynamics. Our approach enables accurate long-term predictions of the high-dimensional dynamics of rigid and deformable systems with increased data efficiency by inferring interpretable and physically plausible reduced Lagrangian models.

### Sensitive Content Classification in Social Media: A Holistic Resource   and Evaluation
**Authors**: Dimosthenis Antypas, Indira Sen, Carla Perez-Almendros, Jose Camacho-Collados, Francesco Barbieri

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:44:02Z

**Summary**: The detection of sensitive content in large datasets is crucial for ensuring that shared and analysed data is free from harmful material. However, current moderation tools, such as external APIs, suffer from limitations in customisation, accuracy across diverse sensitive categories, and privacy concerns. Additionally, existing datasets and open-source models focus predominantly on toxic language, leaving gaps in detecting other sensitive categories such as substance abuse or self-harm. In this paper, we put forward a unified dataset tailored for social media content moderation across six sensitive categories: conflictual language, profanity, sexually explicit material, drug-related content, self-harm, and spam. By collecting and annotating data with consistent retrieval strategies and guidelines, we address the shortcomings of previous focalised research. Our analysis demonstrates that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on this novel dataset yields significant improvements in detection performance compared to open off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA, and even proprietary OpenAI models, which underperform by 10-15% overall. This limitation is even more pronounced on popular moderation APIs, which cannot be easily tailored to specific sensitive content categories, among others.

### Classical transport in a maximally chaotic chain
**Authors**: William Alderson, Rémy Dubertrand, Akira Shudo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:41:30Z

**Summary**: A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced. This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the microscopic chaos.

### SAT-HMR: Real-Time Multi-Person 3D Mesh Estimation via Scale-Adaptive   Tokens
**Authors**: Chi Su, Xiaoxuan Ma, Jiajun Su, Yizhou Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:34:46Z

**Summary**: We propose a one-stage framework for real-time multi-person 3D human mesh estimation from a single RGB image. While current one-stage methods, which follow a DETR-style pipeline, achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with high-resolution inputs, we observe that this particularly benefits the estimation of individuals in smaller scales of the image (e.g., those far from the camera), but at the cost of significantly increased computation overhead. To address this, we introduce scale-adaptive tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on the relative scale of each individual in the image within the DETR framework. Specifically, individuals in smaller scales are processed at higher resolutions, larger ones at lower resolutions, and background regions are further distilled. These scale-adaptive tokens more efficiently encode the image features, facilitating subsequent decoding to regress the human mesh, while allowing the model to allocate computational resources more effectively and focus on more challenging cases. Experiments show that our method preserves the accuracy benefits of high-resolution processing while substantially reducing computational cost, achieving real-time inference with performance comparable to SOTA methods.

### GradAlign for Training-free Model Performance Inference
**Authors**: Yuxuan Li, Yunhui Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:27:55Z

**Summary**: Architecture plays an important role in deciding the performance of deep neural networks. However, the search for the optimal architecture is often hindered by the vast search space, making it a time-intensive process. Recently, a novel approach known as training-free neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged, aiming to discover the ideal architecture without necessitating extensive training. Training-free NAS leverages various indicators for architecture selection, including metrics such as the count of linear regions, the density of per-sample losses, and the stability of the finite-width Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrix. Despite the competitive empirical performance of current training-free NAS techniques, they suffer from certain limitations, including inconsistent performance and a lack of deep understanding. In this paper, we introduce GradAlign, a simple yet effective method designed for inferring model performance without the need for training. At its core, GradAlign quantifies the extent of conflicts within per-sample gradients during initialization, as substantial conflicts hinder model convergence and ultimately result in worse performance. We evaluate GradAlign against established training-free NAS methods using standard NAS benchmarks, showing a better overall performance. Moreover, we show that the widely adopted metric of linear region count may not suffice as a dependable criterion for selecting network architectures during at initialization.

### Recent Advances of Foundation Language Models-based Continual Learning:   A Survey
**Authors**: Yutao Yang, Jie Zhou, Xuanwen Ding, Tianyu Huai, Shunyu Liu, Qin Chen, Yuan Xie, Liang He

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:19:01Z

**Summary**: Recently, foundation language models (LMs) have marked significant achievements in the domains of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Unlike traditional neural network models, foundation LMs obtain a great ability for transfer learning by acquiring rich commonsense knowledge through pre-training on extensive unsupervised datasets with a vast number of parameters. However, they still can not emulate human-like continuous learning due to catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, various continual learning (CL)-based methodologies have been developed to refine LMs, enabling them to adapt to new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, a systematic taxonomy of existing approaches and a comparison of their performance are still lacking, which is the gap that our survey aims to fill. We delve into a comprehensive review, summarization, and classification of the existing literature on CL-based approaches applied to foundation language models, such as pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We divide these studies into offline CL and online CL, which consist of traditional methods, parameter-efficient-based methods, instruction tuning-based methods and continual pre-training methods. Offline CL encompasses domain-incremental learning, task-incremental learning, and class-incremental learning, while online CL is subdivided into hard task boundary and blurry task boundary settings. Additionally, we outline the typical datasets and metrics employed in CL research and provide a detailed analysis of the challenges and future work for LMs-based continual learning.

### Think Beyond Size: Adaptive Prompting for More Effective Reasoning
**Authors**: Kamesh R

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:18:29Z

**Summary**: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to their impressive capabilities as few-shot learners. Recent techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, have significantly advanced multi-step reasoning by introducing step-by-step decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, these approaches often rely on static prompting templates that do not adapt to task complexity or errors during the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Prompting, a dynamic and iterative framework designed to enhance reasoning by incorporating real-time adjustments to prompt structures and validation mechanisms.Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Prompting significantly improves performance on diverse reasoning benchmarks, including arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, MultiArith), logical reasoning and commonsense tasks, achieving substantial accuracy gains compared to static prompting baselines. By integrating guided prompts, intermediate validation, and self-corrective steps, our approach enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger counterparts, such as GPT-4, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework achieves this without requiring fine-tuning or task-specific training data, highlighting the untapped potential of iterative reasoning methods.

### Advanced System Integration: Analyzing OpenAPI Chunking for   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Robin D. Pesl, Jerin G. Mathew, Massimo Mecella, Marco Aiello

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:09:43Z

**Summary**: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score.

### Efficient Text-driven Motion Generation via Latent Consistency Training
**Authors**: Mengxian Hu, Minghao Zhu, Xun Zhou, Qingqing Yan, Shu Li, Chengju Liu, Qijun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:03:59Z

**Summary**: Text-driven human motion generation based on diffusion strategies establishes a reliable foundation for multimodal applications in human-computer interactions. However, existing advances face significant efficiency challenges due to the substantial computational overhead of iteratively solving for nonlinear reverse diffusion trajectories during the inference phase. To this end, we propose the motion latent consistency training framework (MLCT), which precomputes reverse diffusion trajectories from raw data in the training phase and enables few-step or single-step inference via self-consistency constraints in the inference phase. Specifically, a motion autoencoder with quantization constraints is first proposed for constructing concise and bounded solution distributions for motion diffusion processes. Subsequently, a classifier-free guidance format is constructed via an additional unconditional loss function to accomplish the precomputation of conditional diffusion trajectories in the training phase. Finally, a clustering guidance module based on the K-nearest-neighbor algorithm is developed for the chain-conduction optimization mechanism of self-consistency constraints, which provides additional references of solution distributions at a small query cost. By combining these enhancements, we achieve stable and consistency training in non-pixel modality and latent representation spaces. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional consistency distillation methods with reduced training cost and enhances the consistency model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art models with lower inference costs.

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:03:14Z

**Summary**: The performance differential of large language models (LLM) between languages hinders their effective deployment in many regions, inhibiting the potential economic and societal value of generative AI tools in many communities. However, the development of functional LLMs in many languages (\ie, multilingual LLMs) is bottlenecked by the lack of high-quality evaluation resources in languages other than English. Moreover, current practices in multilingual benchmark construction often translate English resources, ignoring the regional and cultural knowledge of the environments in which multilingual systems would be used. In this work, we construct an evaluation suite of 197,243 QA pairs from local exam sources to measure the capabilities of multilingual LLMs in a variety of regional contexts. Our novel resource, INCLUDE, is a comprehensive knowledge- and reasoning-centric benchmark across 44 written languages that evaluates multilingual LLMs for performance in the actual language environments where they would be deployed.

### Statistical learning theory and Occam's razor: The core argument
**Authors**: Tom F. Sterkenburg

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:02:21Z

**Summary**: Statistical learning theory is often associated with the principle of Occam's razor, which recommends a simplicity preference in inductive inference. This paper distills the core argument for simplicity obtainable from statistical learning theory, built on the theory's central learning guarantee for the method of empirical risk minimization. This core "means-ends" argument is that a simpler hypothesis class or inductive model is better because it has better learning guarantees; however, these guarantees are model-relative and so the theoretical push towards simplicity is checked by our prior knowledge.

### Adjusting auxiliary variables under approximate neighborhood   interference
**Authors**: Xin Lu, Yuhao Wang, Zhiheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:51:55Z

**Summary**: Randomized experiments are the gold standard for causal inference. However, traditional assumptions, such as the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), often fail in real-world settings where interference between units is present. Network interference, in particular, has garnered significant attention. Structural models, like the linear-in-means model, are commonly used to describe interference; but they rely on the correct specification of the model, which can be restrictive. Recent advancements in the literature, such as the Approximate Neighborhood Interference (ANI) framework, offer more flexible approaches by assuming negligible interference from distant units. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for regression adjustment for the network experiments under the ANI assumption. This framework expands traditional regression adjustment by accounting for imbalances in network-based covariates, ensuring precision improvement, and providing shorter confidence intervals. We establish the validity of our approach using a design-based inference framework, which relies solely on randomization of treatment assignments for inference without requiring correctly specified outcome models.

### A Survey on Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:51:23Z

**Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better than GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

### Cherry on Top: Parameter Heterogeneity and Quantization in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Wanyun Cui, Qianle Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:49:20Z

**Summary**: This paper reveals the phenomenon of parameter heterogeneity in large language models (LLMs). We find that a small subset of "cherry" parameters exhibit a disproportionately large influence on model performance, while the vast majority of parameters have minimal impact. This heterogeneity is found to be prevalent across different model families, scales, and types. Motivated by this observation, we propose CherryQ, a novel quantization method that unifies the optimization of mixed-precision parameters. CherryQ identifies and preserves the critical cherry parameters in high precision while aggressively quantizing the remaining parameters to low precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CherryQ. CherryQ outperforms existing quantization approaches in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance. Notably, our 3-bit quantized Vicuna-1.5 exhibits competitive performance compared to their 16-bit counterparts.

### PerLA: Perceptive 3D Language Assistant
**Authors**: Guofeng Mei, Wei Lin, Luigi Riz, Yujiao Wu, Fabio Poiesi, Yiming Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:20:29Z

**Summary**: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning.\url{https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/}

### LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware   Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos
**Authors**: Tiantian Geng, Jinrui Zhang, Qingni Wang, Teng Wang, Jinming Duan, Feng Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:18:06Z

**Summary**: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.

### Dual Risk Minimization: Towards Next-Level Robustness in Fine-tuning   Zero-Shot Models
**Authors**: Kaican Li, Weiyan Xie, Yongxiang Huang, Didan Deng, Lanqing Hong, Zhenguo Li, Ricardo Silva, Nevin L. Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:01:25Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning foundation models often compromises their robustness to distribution shifts. To remedy this, most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pre-trained features. However, not all pre-trained features are robust and those methods are largely indifferent to which ones to preserve. We propose dual risk minimization (DRM), which combines empirical risk minimization with worst-case risk minimization, to better preserve the core features of downstream tasks. In particular, we utilize core-feature descriptions generated by LLMs to induce core-based zero-shot predictions which then serve as proxies to estimate the worst-case risk. DRM balances two crucial aspects of model robustness: expected performance and worst-case performance, establishing a new state of the art on various real-world benchmarks. DRM significantly improves the out-of-distribution performance of CLIP ViT-L/14@336 on ImageNet (75.9 to 77.1), WILDS-iWildCam (47.1 to 51.8), and WILDS-FMoW (50.7 to 53.1); opening up new avenues for robust fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/vaynexie/DRM .

### Sourcerer: Sample-based Maximum Entropy Source Distribution Estimation
**Authors**: Julius Vetter, Guy Moss, Cornelius Schröder, Richard Gao, Jakob H. Macke

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:50:25Z

**Summary**: Scientific modeling applications often require estimating a distribution of parameters consistent with a dataset of observations - an inference task also known as source distribution estimation. This problem can be ill-posed, however, since many different source distributions might produce the same distribution of data-consistent simulations. To make a principled choice among many equally valid sources, we propose an approach which targets the maximum entropy distribution, i.e., prioritizes retaining as much uncertainty as possible. Our method is purely sample-based - leveraging the Sliced-Wasserstein distance to measure the discrepancy between the dataset and simulations - and thus suitable for simulators with intractable likelihoods. We benchmark our method on several tasks, and show that it can recover source distributions with substantially higher entropy than recent source estimation methods, without sacrificing the fidelity of the simulations. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we infer source distributions for parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model from experimental datasets with thousands of single-neuron measurements. In summary, we propose a principled method for inferring source distributions of scientific simulator parameters while retaining as much uncertainty as possible.

### Evaluating the Data Model Robustness of Text-to-SQL Systems Based on   Real User Queries
**Authors**: Jonathan Fürst, Catherine Kosten, Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Yi Zhang, Kurt Stockinger

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:44:27Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models. For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models. We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments. Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.

### What Differentiates Educational Literature? A Multimodal Fusion Approach   of Transformers and Computational Linguistics
**Authors**: Jordan J. Bird

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:41:48Z

**Summary**: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal approaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference time. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.

### CLIPArTT: Adaptation of CLIP to New Domains at Test Time
**Authors**: Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim, David Osowiechi, Mehrdad Noori, Milad Cheraghalikhani, Ali Bahri, Moslem Yazdanpanah, Ismail Ben Ayed, Christian Desrosiers

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:27:46Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, demonstrate remarkable adaptability across zero-shot classification tasks without additional training. However, their performance diminishes in the presence of domain shifts. In this study, we introduce CLIP Adaptation duRing Test-Time (CLIPArTT), a fully test-time adaptation (TTA) approach for CLIP, which involves automatic text prompts construction during inference for their use as text supervision. Our method employs a unique, minimally invasive text prompt tuning process, wherein multiple predicted classes are aggregated into a single new text prompt, used as \emph{pseudo label} to re-classify inputs in a transductive manner. Additionally, we pioneer the standardization of TTA benchmarks (e.g., TENT) in the realm of VLMs. Our findings demonstrate that, without requiring additional transformations nor new trainable modules, CLIPArTT enhances performance dynamically across non-corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-100, corrupted datasets like CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C, alongside synthetic datasets such as VisDA-C. This research underscores the potential for improving VLMs' adaptability through novel test-time strategies, offering insights for robust performance across varied datasets and environments.

### JetFormer: An Autoregressive Generative Model of Raw Images and Text
**Authors**: Michael Tschannen, André Susano Pinto, Alexander Kolesnikov

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:14:59Z

**Summary**: Removing modeling constraints and unifying architectures across domains has been a key driver of the recent progress in training large multimodal models. However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.

### Know Your RAG: Dataset Taxonomy and Generation Strategies for Evaluating   RAG Systems
**Authors**: Rafael Teixeira de Lima, Shubham Gupta, Cesar Berrospi, Lokesh Mishra, Michele Dolfi, Peter Staar, Panagiotis Vagenas

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:57:07Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are a widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the industry. While many tools exist empowering developers to build their own systems, measuring their performance locally, with datasets reflective of the system's use cases, is a technological challenge. Solutions to this problem range from non-specific and cheap (most public datasets) to specific and costly (generating data from local documents). In this paper, we show that using public question and answer (Q&A) datasets to assess retrieval performance can lead to non-optimal systems design, and that common tools for RAG dataset generation can lead to unbalanced data. We propose solutions to these issues based on the characterization of RAG datasets through labels and through label-targeted data generation. Finally, we show that fine-tuned small LLMs can efficiently generate Q&A datasets. We believe that these observations are invaluable to the know-your-data step of RAG systems development.

### MIMDE: Exploring the Use of Synthetic vs Human Data for Evaluating   Multi-Insight Multi-Document Extraction Tasks
**Authors**: John Francis, Saba Esnaashari, Anton Poletaev, Sukankana Chakraborty, Youmna Hashem, Jonathan Bright

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:24:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text analysis tasks, yet their evaluation on complex, real-world applications remains challenging. We define a set of tasks, Multi-Insight Multi-Document Extraction (MIMDE) tasks, which involves extracting an optimal set of insights from a document corpus and mapping these insights back to their source documents. This task is fundamental to many practical applications, from analyzing survey responses to processing medical records, where identifying and tracing key insights across documents is crucial. We develop an evaluation framework for MIMDE and introduce a novel set of complementary human and synthetic datasets to examine the potential of synthetic data for LLM evaluation. After establishing optimal metrics for comparing extracted insights, we benchmark 20 state-of-the-art LLMs on both datasets. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation (0.71) between the ability of LLMs to extracts insights on our two datasets but synthetic data fails to capture the complexity of document-level analysis. These findings offer crucial guidance for the use of synthetic data in evaluating text analysis systems, highlighting both its potential and limitations.

### SURE-VQA: Systematic Understanding of Robustness Evaluation in Medical   VQA Tasks
**Authors**: Kim-Celine Kahl, Selen Erkan, Jeremias Traub, Carsten T. Lüth, Klaus Maier-Hein, Lena Maier-Hein, Paul F. Jaeger

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:22:52Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts on unseen data remains a critical concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations, limiting their ability to accurately assess model robustness. To address this gap, our work introduces a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key requirements to overcome the current pitfalls and systematically analyze the robustness of VLMs: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, robustness should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the robustness of various fine-tuning methods across three medical datasets with four different types of distribution shifts.

### Privacy-Preserving Orthogonal Aggregation for Guaranteeing Gender   Fairness in Federated Recommendation
**Authors**: Siqing Zhang, Yuchen Ding, Wei Tang, Wei Sun, Yong Liao, Peng Yuan Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:12:11Z

**Summary**: Under stringent privacy constraints, whether federated recommendation systems can achieve group fairness remains an inadequately explored question. Taking gender fairness as a representative issue, we identify three phenomena in federated recommendation systems: performance difference, data imbalance, and preference disparity. We discover that the state-of-the-art methods only focus on the first phenomenon. Consequently, their imposition of inappropriate fairness constraints detrimentally affects the model training. Moreover, due to insufficient sensitive attribute protection of existing works, we can infer the gender of all users with 99.90% accuracy even with the addition of maximal noise. In this work, we propose Privacy-Preserving Orthogonal Aggregation (PPOA), which employs the secure aggregation scheme and quantization technique, to prevent the suppression of minority groups by the majority and preserve the distinct preferences for better group fairness. PPOA can assist different groups in obtaining their respective model aggregation results through a designed orthogonal mapping while keeping their attributes private. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PPOA enhances recommendation effectiveness for both females and males by up to 8.25% and 6.36%, respectively, with a maximum overall improvement of 7.30%, and achieves optimal fairness in most cases. Extensive ablation experiments and visualizations indicate that PPOA successfully maintains preferences for different gender groups.

### ChineseWebText 2.0: Large-Scale High-quality Chinese Web Text with   Multi-dimensional and fine-grained information
**Authors**: Wanyue Zhang, Ziyong Li, Wen Yang, Chunlin Leng, Yinan Bai, Qianlong Du, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:48:49Z

**Summary**: During the development of large language models (LLMs), pre-training data play a critical role in shaping LLMs' capabilities. In recent years several large-scale and high-quality pre-training datasets have been released to accelerate the research of LLMs, including ChineseWebText1.0, C4, Pile, WanJuan, MAPCC and others. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, focus has increasingly shifted to domain-specific capabilities and safety concerns, making those previous coarse-grained texts insufficient for meeting training requirements. Furthermore, fine-grained information, such as quality, domain and toxicity, is becoming increasingly important in building powerful and reliable LLMs for various scenarios. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a new tool-chain called MDFG-tool for constructing large-scale and high-quality Chinese datasets with multi-dimensional and fine-grained information. First, we employ manually crafted rules to discard explicit noisy texts from raw contents. Second, the quality evaluation model, domain classifier, and toxicity evaluation model are well-designed to assess the remaining cleaned data respectively. Finally, we integrate these three types of fine-grained information for each text. With this approach, we release the largest, high-quality and fine-grained Chinese text ChineseWebText2.0, which consists of 3.8TB and each text is associated with a quality score, domain labels, a toxicity label and a toxicity score, facilitating the LLM researchers to select data based on various types of fine-grained information. The data, codes and the tool-chain are available on this website https://github.com/CASIA-LM/ChineseWebText-2.0

### GPTuner: A Manual-Reading Database Tuning System via GPT-Guided Bayesian   Optimization
**Authors**: Jiale Lao, Yibo Wang, Yufei Li, Jianping Wang, Yunjia Zhang, Zhiyuan Cheng, Wanghu Chen, Mingjie Tang, Jianguo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:33:45Z

**Summary**: Modern database management systems (DBMS) expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviours. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance is a long-standing problem in the database community. As there is an increasing number of knobs to tune and each knob could be in continuous or categorical values, manual tuning becomes impractical. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods have shown great potentials. However, existing approaches still incur significant tuning costs or only yield sub-optimal performance. This is because they either ignore the extensive domain knowledge available (e.g., DBMS manuals and forum discussions) and only rely on the runtime feedback of benchmark evaluations to guide the optimization, or they utilize the domain knowledge in a limited way. Hence, we propose GPTuner, a manual-reading database tuning system. Firstly, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline to collect and refine heterogeneous knowledge, and propose a prompt ensemble algorithm to unify a structured view of the refined knowledge. Secondly, using the structured knowledge, we (1) design a workload-aware and training-free knob selection strategy, (2) develop a search space optimization technique considering the value range of each knob, and (3) propose a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space. Finally, we evaluate GPTuner under different benchmarks (TPC-C and TPC-H), metrics (throughput and latency) as well as DBMS (PostgreSQL and MySQL). Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, GPTuner identifies better configurations in 16x less time on average. Moreover, GPTuner achieves up to 30% performance improvement (higher throughput or lower latency) over the best-performing alternative.

### Truth or Mirage? Towards End-to-End Factuality Evaluation with LLM-OASIS
**Authors**: Alessandro Scirè, Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Simone Tedeschi, Karim Ghonim, Federico Martelli, Roberto Navigli

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:21:15Z

**Summary**: After the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been substantial improvements in the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Text Summarization and Machine Translation. However, LLMs still produce outputs containing hallucinations, that is, content not grounded in factual information. Therefore, developing methods to assess the factuality of LLMs has become urgent.   Indeed, resources for factuality evaluation have recently emerged. Although challenging, these resources face one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are tailored to a specific task or domain; (ii) they are limited in size, thereby preventing the training of new factuality evaluators; (iii) they are designed for simpler verification tasks, such as claim verification.   To address these issues, we introduce LLM-Oasis, to the best of our knowledge the largest resource for training end-to-end factuality evaluators. LLM-Oasis is constructed by extracting claims from Wikipedia, falsifying a subset of these claims, and generating pairs of factual and unfactual texts. We then rely on human annotators to both validate the quality of our dataset and to create a gold standard test set for benchmarking factuality evaluation systems.   Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Oasis presents a significant challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs, with GPT-4o achieving up to 60% accuracy in our proposed end-to-end factuality evaluation task, highlighting its potential to drive future research in the field.

### Enhancing Security in Third-Party Library Reuse -- Comprehensive   Detection of 1-day Vulnerability through Code Patch Analysis
**Authors**: Shangzhi Xu, Jialiang Dong, Weiting Cai, Juanru Li, Arash Shaghaghi, Nan Sun, Siqi Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:02:28Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, software development progresses rapidly to incorporate new features. To facilitate such growth and provide convenience for developers when creating and updating software, reusing open-source software (i.e., thirdparty library reuses) has become one of the most effective and efficient methods. Unfortunately, the practice of reusing third-party libraries (TPLs) can also introduce vulnerabilities (known as 1-day vulnerabilities) because of the low maintenance of TPLs, resulting in many vulnerable versions remaining in use. If the software incorporating these TPLs fails to detect the introduced vulnerabilities and leads to delayed updates, it will exacerbate the security risks. However, the complicated code dependencies and flexibility of TPL reuses make the detection of 1-day vulnerability a challenging task. To support developers in securely reusing TPLs during software development, we design and implement VULTURE, an effective and efficient detection tool, aiming at identifying 1-day vulnerabilities that arise from the reuse of vulnerable TPLs. It first executes a database creation method, TPLFILTER, which leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically build a unique database for the targeted platform. Instead of relying on code-level similarity comparison, VULTURE employs hashing-based comparison to explore the dependencies among the collected TPLs and identify the similarities between the TPLs and the target projects. Recognizing that developers have the flexibility to reuse TPLs exactly or in a custom manner, VULTURE separately conducts version-based comparison and chunk-based analysis to capture fine-grained semantic features at the function levels. We applied VULTURE to 10 real-world projects to assess its effectiveness and efficiency in detecting 1-day vulnerabilities. VULTURE successfully identified 175 vulnerabilities from 178 reused TPLs.

### Steering Large Language Models using Conceptors: Improving   Addition-Based Activation Engineering
**Authors**: Joris Postmus, Steven Abreu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:52:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.

### Fast post-process Bayesian inference with Variational Sparse Bayesian   Quadrature
**Authors**: Chengkun Li, Grégoire Clarté, Martin Jørgensen, Luigi Acerbi

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:49:04Z

**Summary**: In applied Bayesian inference scenarios, users may have access to a large number of pre-existing model evaluations, for example from maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) optimization runs. However, traditional approximate inference techniques make little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework of post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior approximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model calls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models with black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target density evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP Bayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast approximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational neuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior approximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further model evaluations.

### OneBit: Towards Extremely Low-bit Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuzhuang Xu, Xu Han, Zonghan Yang, Shuo Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiyuan Liu, Weidong Liu, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:47:55Z

**Summary**: Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of existing models to be quantized, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, current quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit model compressing framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the quantization framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 81% of the non-quantized performance on LLaMA models) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.

### RMIO: A Model-Based MARL Framework for Scenarios with Observation Loss   in Some Agents
**Authors**: Shi Zifeng, Liu Meiqin, Zhang Senlin, Zheng Ronghao, Dong Shanling

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:45:21Z

**Summary**: In recent years, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has emerged as a solution to address sample complexity in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by modeling agent-environment dynamics to improve sample efficiency. However, most MBRL methods assume complete and continuous observations from each agent during the inference stage, which can be overly idealistic in practical applications. A novel model-based MARL approach called RMIO is introduced to address this limitation, specifically designed for scenarios where observation is lost in some agent. RMIO leverages the world model to reconstruct missing observations, and further reduces reconstruction errors through inter-agent information integration to ensure stable multi-agent decision-making. Secondly, unlike CTCE methods such as MAMBA, RMIO adopts the CTDE paradigm in standard environment, and enabling limited communication only when agents lack observation data, thereby reducing reliance on communication. Additionally, RMIO improves asymptotic performance through strategies such as reward smoothing, a dual-layer experience replay buffer, and an RNN-augmented policy model, surpassing previous work. Our experiments conducted in both the SMAC and MaMuJoCo environments demonstrate that RMIO outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of asymptotic convergence performance and policy robustness, both in standard mission settings and in scenarios involving observation loss.

### LLM Teacher-Student Framework for Text Classification With No Manually   Annotated Data: A Case Study in IPTC News Topic Classification
**Authors**: Taja Kuzman, Nikola Ljubešić

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:42:58Z

**Summary**: With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language models (LLMs) for developing multilingual news classification models of reasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop an IPTC Media Topic training dataset through automatic annotation of news articles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. The teacher model exhibits a high zero-shot performance on all four languages. Its agreement with human annotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves. To mitigate the computational limitations associated with the requirement of processing millions of texts daily, smaller BERT-like student models are fine-tuned on the GPT-annotated dataset. These student models achieve high performance comparable to the teacher model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the training data size on the performance of the student models and investigate their monolingual, multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities. The findings indicate that student models can achieve high performance with a relatively small number of training instances, and demonstrate strong zero-shot cross-lingual abilities. Finally, we publish the best-performing news topic classifier, enabling multilingual classification with the top-level categories of the IPTC Media Topic schema.

### Build An Influential Bot In Social Media Simulations With Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Bailu Jin, Weisi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:37:12Z

**Summary**: Understanding the dynamics of public opinion evolution on online social platforms is critical for analyzing influence mechanisms. Traditional approaches to influencer analysis are typically divided into qualitative assessments of personal attributes and quantitative evaluations of influence power. In this study, we introduce a novel simulated environment that combines Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling agents to generate posts, form opinions, and update follower networks. This simulation allows for more detailed observations of how opinion leaders emerge. Additionally, we present an innovative application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replicate the process of opinion leader formation. Our findings reveal that limiting the action space and incorporating self-observation are key factors for achieving stable opinion leader generation. The learning curves demonstrate the model's capacity to identify optimal strategies and adapt to complex, unpredictable dynamics.

### When LLMs Go Online: The Emerging Threat of Web-Enabled LLMs
**Authors**: Hanna Kim, Minkyoo Song, Seung Ho Na, Seungwon Shin, Kimin Lee

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:30:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of impersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the click rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up to 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.

### Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Visual-Token   Exit and the Empirical Findings
**Authors**: Qiong Wu, Wenhao Lin, Weihao Ye, Yiyi Zhou, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:24:23Z

**Summary**: The excessive use of visual tokens in existing Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibits obvious redundancy and brings in prohibitively expensive computation. To gain insights into this problem, we first conduct extensive empirical studies on the attention behaviors of MLLMs, and summarize three main inference stages in MLLMs: (i) Early fusion between tokens is first accomplished quickly. (ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is anonymously released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.

### GREAT: Geometry-Intention Collaborative Inference for Open-Vocabulary 3D   Object Affordance Grounding
**Authors**: Yawen Shao, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Hongchen Luo, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:23:15Z

**Summary**: Open-Vocabulary 3D object affordance grounding aims to anticipate ``action possibilities'' regions on 3D objects with arbitrary instructions, which is crucial for robots to generically perceive real scenarios and respond to operational changes. Existing methods focus on combining images or languages that depict interactions with 3D geometries to introduce external interaction priors. However, they are still vulnerable to a limited semantic space by failing to leverage implied invariant geometries and potential interaction intentions. Normally, humans address complex tasks through multi-step reasoning and respond to diverse situations by leveraging associative and analogical thinking. In light of this, we propose GREAT (GeometRy-intEntion collAboraTive inference) for Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Affordance Grounding, a novel framework that mines the object invariant geometry attributes and performs analogically reason in potential interaction scenarios to form affordance knowledge, fully combining the knowledge with both geometries and visual contents to ground 3D object affordance. Besides, we introduce the Point Image Affordance Dataset v2 (PIADv2), the largest 3D object affordance dataset at present to support the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of GREAT. Code and dataset are available at project.

### LLM-Rank: A Graph Theoretical Approach to Pruning Large Language Models
**Authors**: David Hoffmann, Kailash Budhathoki, Matthaeus Kleindessner

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:21:29Z

**Summary**: The evolving capabilities of large language models are accompanied by growing sizes and deployment costs, necessitating effective inference optimisation techniques. We propose a novel pruning method utilising centrality measures from graph theory, reducing both the computational requirements and the memory footprint of these models. Specifically, we devise a method for creating a weighted directed acyclical graph representation of multilayer perceptrons to which we apply a modified version of the weighted PageRank centrality measure to compute node importance scores. In combination with uniform pruning this leads to structured sparsity. We call this pruning method MLPRank. Furthermore we introduce an extension to decoder-only transformer models and call it LLMRank. For both variants we demonstrate a strong performance. With MLPRank on average leading to 6.09 % higher accuracy retention than three popular baselines and 13.42 % with LLMRank compared to two popular baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/llm-rank-pruning.

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:10:29Z

**Summary**: We present the Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA) package, a scalable machine learning framework designed to accelerate density functional theory (DFT) calculations suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. Using local descriptors of the atomic environment, MALA models efficiently predict key electronic observables, including local density of states, electronic density, density of states, and total energy. The package integrates data sampling, model training and scalable inference into a unified library, while ensuring compatibility with standard DFT and molecular dynamics codes. We demonstrate MALA's capabilities with examples including boron clusters, aluminum across its solid-liquid phase boundary, and predicting the electronic structure of a stacking fault in a large beryllium slab. Scaling analyses reveal MALA's computational efficiency and identify bottlenecks for future optimization. With its ability to model electronic structures at scales far beyond standard DFT, MALA is well suited for modeling complex material systems, making it a versatile tool for advanced materials research.

### Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language   Models: What is There and What is Missing?
**Authors**: Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:46:22Z

**Summary**: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) that have revolutionized text-based NLP. This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.

### Towards Evaluating Generalist Agents: An Automated Benchmark in Open   World
**Authors**: Xinyue Zheng, Haowei Lin, Kaichen He, Zihao Wang, Zilong Zheng, Yitao Liang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:39:26Z

**Summary**: Evaluating generalist agents presents significant challenges due to their wide-ranging abilities and the limitations of current benchmarks in assessing true generalization. We introduce the Minecraft Universe (MCU), a fully automated benchmarking framework set within the open-world game Minecraft. MCU dynamically generates and evaluates a broad spectrum of tasks, offering three core components: 1) a task generation mechanism that provides high degrees of freedom and variability, 2) an ever-expanding set of over 3K composable atomic tasks, and 3) a general evaluation framework that supports open-ended task assessment. By integrating large language models (LLMs), MCU dynamically creates diverse environments for each evaluation, fostering agent generalization. The framework uses a vision-language model (VLM) to automatically generate evaluation criteria, achieving over 90% agreement with human ratings across multi-dimensional assessments, which demonstrates that MCU is a scalable and explainable solution for evaluating generalist agents. Additionally, we show that while state-of-the-art foundational models perform well on specific tasks, they often struggle with increased task diversity and difficulty.

### Exploring Italian sentence embeddings properties through multi-tasking
**Authors**: Vivi Nastase, Giuseppe Samo, Chunyang Jiang, Paola Merlo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:30:11Z

**Summary**: We investigate to what degree existing LLMs encode abstract linguistic information in Italian in a multi-task setting. We exploit curated synthetic data on a large scale -- several Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) problems in Italian -- and use them to study how sentence representations built using pre-trained language models encode specific syntactic and semantic information. We use a two-level architecture to model separately a compression of the sentence embeddings into a representation that contains relevant information for a task, and a BLM task. We then investigate whether we can obtain compressed sentence representations that encode syntactic and semantic information relevant to several BLM tasks. While we expected that the sentence structure -- in terms of sequence of phrases/chunks -- and chunk properties could be shared across tasks, performance and error analysis show that the clues for the different tasks are encoded in different manners in the sentence embeddings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions such as constituents or thematic roles does not seem to be present in the pretrained sentence embeddings.

### Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data   Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models
**Authors**: Yulei Qin, Yuncheng Yang, Pengcheng Guo, Gang Li, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Yun Gu, Ke Li, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:10:43Z

**Summary**: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies. All related contents are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fantastic-data-engineering.

### Can Large Language Models Reason about the Region Connection Calculus?
**Authors**: Anthony G Cohn, Robert E Blackwell

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:10:16Z

**Summary**: Qualitative Spatial Reasoning is a well explored area of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and has multiple applications ranging from Geographical Information Systems to Robotics and Computer Vision. Recently, many claims have been made for the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, we investigate the extent to which a set of representative LLMs can perform classical qualitative spatial reasoning tasks on the mereotopological Region Connection Calculus, RCC-8. We conduct three pairs of experiments (reconstruction of composition tables, alignment to human composition preferences, conceptual neighbourhood reconstruction) using state-of-the-art LLMs; in each pair one experiment uses eponymous relations and one, anonymous relations (to test the extent to which the LLM relies on knowledge about the relation names obtained during training). All instances are repeated 30 times to measure the stochasticity of the LLMs.

### In-Context Learning with Noisy Labels
**Authors**: Junyong Kang, Donghyun Son, Hwanjun Song, Buru Chang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:54:08Z

**Summary**: In-context learning refers to the emerging ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform a target task without additional training, utilizing demonstrations of the task. Recent studies aim to enhance in-context learning performance by selecting more useful demonstrations. However, they overlook the presence of inevitable noisy labels in task demonstrations that arise during the labeling process in the real-world. In this paper, we propose a new task, in-context learning with noisy labels, which aims to solve real-world problems for in-context learning where labels in task demonstrations would be corrupted. Moreover, we propose a new method and baseline methods for the new task, inspired by studies in learning with noisy labels. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method can serve as a safeguard against performance degradation in in-context learning caused by noisy labels.

### Deep Learning-based Code Reviews: A Paradigm Shift or a Double-Edged   Sword?
**Authors**: Rosalia Tufano, Alberto Martin-Lopez, Ahmad Tayeb, Ozren Dabić, Sonia Haiduc, Gabriele Bavota

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:48:33Z

**Summary**: Several techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Early support consisted in recommending the most suited reviewer for a given change or in prioritizing the review tasks. With the advent of deep learning in software engineering, the level of automation has been pushed to new heights, with approaches able to provide feedback on source code in natural language as a human reviewer would do. Also, recent work documented open source projects adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-reviewers. Although the research in this field is very active, little is known about the actual impact of including automatically generated code reviews in the code review process. While there are many aspects worth investigating, in this work we focus on three of them: (i) review quality, i.e., the reviewer's ability to identify issues in the code; (ii) review cost, i.e., the time spent reviewing the code; and (iii) reviewer's confidence, i.e., how confident is the reviewer about the provided feedback. We run a controlled experiment with 29 experts who reviewed different programs with/without the support of an automatically generated code review. During the experiment we monitored the reviewers' activities, for over 50 hours of recorded code reviews. We show that reviewers consider valid most of the issues automatically identified by the LLM and that the availability of an automated review as a starting point strongly influences their behavior: Reviewers tend to focus on the code locations indicated by the LLM rather than searching for additional issues in other parts of the code. The reviewers who started from an automated review identified a higher number of low-severity issues while, however, not identifying more high-severity issues as compared to a completely manual process. Finally, the automated support did not result in saved time and did not increase the reviewers' confidence.

### A Review of LLM-based Explanations in Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Alan Said

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:47:32Z

**Summary**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and ChatGPT, has opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems through improved explainability. This paper provides a systematic literature review focused on leveraging LLMs to generate explanations for recommendations -- a critical aspect for fostering transparency and user trust. We conducted a comprehensive search within the ACM Guide to Computing Literature, covering publications from the launch of ChatGPT (November 2022) to the present (November 2024). Our search yielded 232 articles, but after applying inclusion criteria, only six were identified as directly addressing the use of LLMs in explaining recommendations. This scarcity highlights that, despite the rise of LLMs, their application in explainable recommender systems is still in an early stage. We analyze these select studies to understand current methodologies, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs improving explanations of recommender systems and encourage the development of more transparent and user-centric recommendation explanation solutions.

### SuperMat: Physically Consistent PBR Material Estimation at Interactive   Rates
**Authors**: Yijia Hong, Yuan-Chen Guo, Ran Yi, Yulong Chen, Yan-Pei Cao, Lizhuang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:44:13Z

**Summary**: Decomposing physically-based materials from images into their constituent properties remains challenging, particularly when maintaining both computational efficiency and physical consistency. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown promise, they face substantial computational overhead due to multiple denoising steps and separate models for different material properties. We present SuperMat, a single-step framework that achieves high-quality material decomposition with one-step inference. This enables end-to-end training with perceptual and re-render losses while decomposing albedo, metallic, and roughness maps at millisecond-scale speeds. We further extend our framework to 3D objects through a UV refinement network, enabling consistent material estimation across viewpoints while maintaining efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SuperMat achieves state-of-the-art PBR material decomposition quality while reducing inference time from seconds to milliseconds per image, and completes PBR material estimation for 3D objects in approximately 3 seconds.

### Canonical correlation analysis of stochastic trends via functional   approximation
**Authors**: Massimo Franchi, Iliyan Georgiev, Paolo Paruolo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:36:10Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a novel canonical correlation analysis for semiparametric inference in $I(1)/I(0)$ systems via functional approximation. The approach can be applied coherently to panels of $p$ variables with a generic number $s$ of stochastic trends, as well as to subsets or aggregations of variables. This study discusses inferential tools on $s$ and on the loading matrix $\psi$ of the stochastic trends (and on their duals $r$ and $\beta$, the cointegration rank and the cointegrating matrix): asymptotically pivotal test sequences and consistent estimators of $s$ and $r$, $T$-consistent, mixed Gaussian and efficient estimators of $\psi$ and $\beta$, Wald tests thereof, and misspecification tests for checking model assumptions. Monte Carlo simulations show that these tools have reliable performance uniformly in $s$ for small, medium and large-dimensional systems, with $p$ ranging from 10 to 300. An empirical analysis of 20 exchange rates illustrates the methods.

### Ensemble Watermarks for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Georg Niess, Roman Kern

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:18:32Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between text written by humans and machines. While watermarks already exist for LLMs, they often lack flexibility, and struggle with attacks such as paraphrasing. To address these issues, we propose a multi-feature method for generating watermarks that combines multiple distinct watermark features into an ensemble watermark. Concretely, we combine acrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to achieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack the performance remains high with 95% detection rate. The red-green feature alone as baseline achieves a detection rate of 49%. The evaluation of all feature combinations reveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection rate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the flexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and trade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, for all ensemble configurations the same detection function can be used without adaptations. This method is particularly of interest to facilitate accountability and prevent societal harm.

### Evaluating Research Quality with Large Language Models: An Analysis of   ChatGPT's Effectiveness with Different Settings and Inputs
**Authors**: Mike Thelwall

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:17:29Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the quality of academic journal articles is a time consuming but critical task for national research evaluation exercises, appointments and promotion. It is therefore important to investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a role in this process. This article assesses which ChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and abstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to which scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results show that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average ChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers) correlating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is slightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest that article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even though complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple ones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough assessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and significance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model scores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing.

### Initialization using Update Approximation is a Silver Bullet for   Extremely Efficient Low-Rank Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Kaustubh Ponkshe, Raghav Singhal, Eduard Gorbunov, Alexey Tumanov, Samuel Horvath, Praneeth Vepakomma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:10:30Z

**Summary**: Low-rank adapters have become a standard approach for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a trainable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using 27-90x fewer parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RaghavSinghal10/lora-sb.

### Unimib Assistant: designing a student-friendly RAG-based chatbot for all   their needs
**Authors**: Chiara Antico, Stefano Giordano, Cansu Koyuturk, Dimitri Ognibene

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:07:21Z

**Summary**: Natural language processing skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) are unprecedented, having wide diffusion and application in different tasks. This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant.

### MH-MoE: Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Shaohan Huang, Xun Wu, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:17Z

**Summary**: Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE) demonstrates superior performance by using the multi-head mechanism to collectively attend to information from various representation spaces within different experts. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of MH-MoE that maintains both FLOPs and parameter parity with sparse Mixture of Experts models. Experimental results on language models show that the new implementation yields quality improvements over both vanilla MoE and fine-grained MoE models. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that MH-MoE is compatible with 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BitNet.

### Training Agents with Weakly Supervised Feedback from Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Dihong Gong, Pu Lu, Zelong Wang, Meng Zhou, Xiuqiang He

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:47:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising basis for creating agents that can tackle complex tasks through iterative environmental interaction. Existing methods either require these agents to mimic expert-provided trajectories or rely on definitive environmental feedback for reinforcement learning which limits their application to specific scenarios like gaming or code generation. This paper introduces a novel training method for LLM-based agents using weakly supervised signals from a critic LLM, bypassing the need for expert trajectories or definitive feedback. Our agents are trained in iterative manner, where they initially generate trajectories through environmental interaction. Subsequently, a critic LLM selects a subset of good trajectories, which are then used to update the agents, enabling them to generate improved trajectories in the next iteration. Extensive tests on the API-bank dataset show consistent improvement in our agents' capabilities and comparable performance to GPT-4, despite using open-source models with much fewer parameters.

### A dynamic parallel method for performance optimization on hybrid CPUs
**Authors**: Luo Yu, Liu Yucheng, Shen Haihao

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:39:24Z

**Summary**: The AIPC concept is gaining popularity, and more and more hybrid CPUs will be running AI models on client devices. However, the current AI inference framework overlooks the imbalanced hardware capability of hybrid CPUs, leading to low inference performance. To address this issue, we have introduced a dynamic parallel method for hybrid CPUs, which significantly increases LLM inference performance by balancing the workload for each core of a hybrid CPU before the parallel work starts. This method has enabled Neural Speed to achieve more than 90% (on average) of memory bandwidth on two hybrid Intel CPUs.

### Knowledge Management for Automobile Failure Analysis Using Graph RAG
**Authors**: Yuta Ojima, Hiroki Sakaji, Tadashi Nakamura, Hiroaki Sakata, Kazuya Seki, Yuu Teshigawara, Masami Yamashita, Kazuhiro Aoyama

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:34:07Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a knowledge management system for automobile failure analysis using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for automobile failure analysis.

### Software Model Evolution with Large Language Models: Experiments on   Simulated, Public, and Industrial Datasets
**Authors**: Christof Tinnes, Alisa Welter, Sven Apel

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:53Z

**Summary**: Modeling structure and behavior of software systems plays a crucial role in the industrial practice of software engineering. As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completions is still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach, RAMC, leveraging large language models, model histories, and retrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments on three datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-source community dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated model repositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for model completion with RAMC. We found that large language models are indeed a promising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30% semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19% type-correct completions). The general inference capabilities of large language models are particularly useful when dealing with concepts for which there are few, noisy, or no examples at all.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### SAM Decoding: Speculative Decoding via Suffix Automaton
**Authors**: Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:16:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by unifying tasks into text generation, yet their large parameter sizes and autoregressive nature limit inference speed. SAM-Decoding addresses this by introducing a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that uses a suffix automaton for efficient and accurate draft generation. Unlike n-gram matching used by the existing method, SAM-Decoding finds the longest suffix match in generating text and text corpuss, achieving an average time complexity of $O(1)$ per generation step. SAM-Decoding constructs static and dynamic suffix automatons for the text corpus and input prompts, respectively, enabling fast and precise draft generation. Meanwhile, it is designed as an approach that can be combined with existing methods, allowing SAM-Decoding to adaptively select a draft generation strategy based on the matching length, thus increasing the inference speed of the LLM. When combined with Token Recycling, evaluations show SAM-Decoding outperforms existing model-free methods, achieving a speedup of $2.27\times$ over autoregressive decoding on Spec-Bench. When combined with EAGLE2, it reaches a speedup of $2.49\times$, surpassing all current approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding.

### RAGDiffusion: Faithful Cloth Generation via External Knowledge   Assimilation
**Authors**: Xianfeng Tan, Yuhan Li, Wenxiang Shang, Yubo Wu, Jian Wang, Xuanhong Chen, Yi Zhang, Ran Lin, Bingbing Ni

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:57:32Z

**Summary**: Standard clothing asset generation involves creating forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized sampling distributions and precise structural requirements in the generated images. Existing models have limited spatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external knowledge from LLM and databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two core processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a three-level alignment that ensures fidelity in structural, pattern, and decoding components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and detail-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.

### An Upper Bound for the Distribution Overlap Index and Its Applications
**Authors**: Hao Fu, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Siddharth Garg, Farshad Khorrami

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:21:45Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes an easy-to-compute upper bound for the overlap index between two probability distributions without requiring any knowledge of the distribution models. The computation of our bound is time-efficient and memory-efficient and only requires finite samples. The proposed bound shows its value in one-class classification and domain shift analysis. Specifically, in one-class classification, we build a novel one-class classifier by converting the bound into a confidence score function. Unlike most one-class classifiers, the training process is not needed for our classifier. Additionally, the experimental results show that our classifier can be accurate with only a small number of in-class samples and outperform many state-of-the-art methods on various datasets in different one-class classification scenarios. In domain shift analysis, we propose a theorem based on our bound. The theorem is useful in detecting the existence of domain shift and inferring data information. The detection and inference processes are both computation-efficient and memory-efficient. Our work shows significant promise toward broadening the applications of overlap-based metrics.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Institutional Portfolio Management:   Persona-Based Ensembles
**Authors**: Yoshia Abe, Shuhei Matsuo, Ryoma Kondo, Ryohei Hisano

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:18:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in various financial applications, though their potential in complex investment strategies remains underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how LLMs can predict price movements in stock and bond portfolios using economic indicators, enabling portfolio adjustments akin to those employed by institutional investors. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating different personas within LLMs, using an ensemble approach to leverage their diverse predictions. Our findings show that LLM-based strategies, especially when combined with the mode ensemble, outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in terms of Sharpe ratio during periods of rising consumer price index (CPI). However, traditional strategies are more effective during declining CPI trends or sharp market downturns. These results suggest that while LLMs can enhance portfolio management, they may require complementary strategies to optimize performance across varying market conditions.

### Ditto: Motion-Space Diffusion for Controllable Realtime Talking Head   Synthesis
**Authors**: Tianqi Li, Ruobing Zheng, Minghui Yang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:01:31Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized audio-driven talking head synthesis. Beyond precise lip synchronization, diffusion-based methods excel in generating subtle expressions and natural head movements that are well-aligned with the audio signal. However, these methods are confronted by slow inference speed, insufficient fine-grained control over facial motions, and occasional visual artifacts largely due to an implicit latent space derived from Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which prevent their adoption in realtime interaction applications. To address these issues, we introduce Ditto, a diffusion-based framework that enables controllable realtime talking head synthesis. Our key innovation lies in bridging motion generation and photorealistic neural rendering through an explicit identity-agnostic motion space, replacing conventional VAE representations. This design substantially reduces the complexity of diffusion learning while enabling precise control over the synthesized talking heads. We further propose an inference strategy that jointly optimizes three key components: audio feature extraction, motion generation, and video synthesis. This optimization enables streaming processing, realtime inference, and low first-frame delay, which are the functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and substantially outperforms existing methods in both motion control and realtime performance.

**Summary**: The advent of instruction-tuned Large Language Models designed for coding tasks (Code LLMs) has transformed software engineering practices. However, their robustness against various input challenges remains a critical concern. This study introduces DegradePrompter, a novel method designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of instruction-tuned Code LLMs. We assess the impact of diverse input challenges on the functionality and correctness of generated code using rigorous metrics and established benchmarks. Our comprehensive evaluation includes five state-of-the-art open-source models and three production-grade closed-source models, revealing varying degrees of robustness. Open-source models demonstrate an increased susceptibility to input perturbations, resulting in declines in functional correctness ranging from 12% to 34%. In contrast, commercial models demonstrate relatively greater resilience, with performance degradation ranging from 3% to 24%. To enhance the robustness of the models against these vulnerabilities, we investigate a straightforward yet effective mitigation strategy. Our findings highlight the need for robust defense mechanisms and comprehensive evaluations during both the development and deployment phases to ensure the resilience and reliability of automated code generation systems.

### TQA-Bench: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Table Question Answering with   Scalable Context and Symbolic Extension
**Authors**: Zipeng Qiu, You Peng, Guangxin He, Binhang Yuan, Chen Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:48:13Z

**Summary**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked great opportunities in complex data management tasks, particularly in question answering (QA) over complicated multi-table relational data. Despite significant progress, systematically evaluating LLMs on multi-table QA remains a critical challenge due to the inherent complexity of analyzing heterogeneous table structures and potential large scale of serialized relational data. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-table QA, failing to capture the intricacies of reasoning across multiple relational tables, as required in real-world domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. To address this gap, we present TQA-Bench, a new multi-table QA benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in tackling complex QA tasks over relational data. Our benchmark incorporates diverse relational database instances sourced from real-world public datasets and introduces a flexible sampling mechanism to create tasks with varying multi-table context lengths, ranging from 8K to 64K tokens. To ensure robustness and reliability, we integrate symbolic extensions into the evaluation framework, enabling the assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities beyond simple data retrieval or probabilistic pattern matching. We systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, both open-source and closed-source, spanning model scales from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive experiments reveal critical insights into the performance of LLMs in multi-table QA, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for advancing their application in complex, data-driven environments. Our benchmark implementation and results are available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/TQA-Bench.

### COLD: Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities
**Authors**: Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Ashutosh Modi

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:37:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, including arithmetic and reasoning; however, to gauge the intellectual capabilities of LLMs, causal reasoning has become a reliable proxy for validating a general understanding of the mechanics and intricacies of the world similar to humans. Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (~ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans. We further explore (the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs) using the backdoor criterion to determine the causal strength between events.

### Protecting Multiple Types of Privacy Simultaneously in EEG-based   Brain-Computer Interfaces
**Authors**: Lubin Meng, Xue Jiang, Tianwang Jia, Dongrui Wu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:33:31Z

**Summary**: A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the preferred input signal in non-invasive BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. EEG-based BCIs have been successfully used in many applications, such as neurological rehabilitation, text input, games, and so on. However, EEG signals inherently carry rich personal information, necessitating privacy protection. This paper demonstrates that multiple types of private information (user identity, gender, and BCI-experience) can be easily inferred from EEG data, imposing a serious privacy threat to BCIs. To address this issue, we design perturbations to convert the original EEG data into privacy-protected EEG data, which conceal the private information while maintaining the primary BCI task performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the privacy-protected EEG data can significantly reduce the classification accuracy of user identity, gender and BCI-experience, but almost do not affect at all the classification accuracy of the primary BCI task, enabling user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.

### Dynamic Universal Approximation Theory: Foundations for Parallelism in   Neural Networks
**Authors**: Wei Wang, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:16:25Z

**Summary**: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.

### Interleaved-Modal Chain-of-Thought
**Authors**: Jun Gao, Yongqi Li, Ziqiang Cao, Wenjie Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:06:35Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to produce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their text-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the original image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal Chain-of-Thought, named \textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)}, which generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and textual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT requires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal content, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the required visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose \textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs. ADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the interleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies solely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and therefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum of VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different architectures. Extensive evaluations of three benchmarks have shown that ICoT prompting achieves substantial performance (up to 14\%) and interpretability improvements compared to existing multimodal CoT prompting methods.

### HE2C: A Holistic Approach for Allocating Latency-Sensitive AI Tasks   across Edge-Cloud
**Authors**: Minseo Kim, Wei Shu, Mohsen Amini Salehi

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:04:08Z

**Summary**: The high computational, memory, and energy demands of Deep Learning (DL) applications often exceed the capabilities of battery-powered edge devices, creating difficulties in meeting task deadlines and accuracy requirements. Unlike previous solutions that optimize a single metric (e.g., accuracy or energy efficiency), HE2C framework is designed to holistically address the latency, memory, accuracy, throughput, and energy demands of DL applications across edge-cloud continuum, thereby, delivering a more comprehensive and effective user experience. HE2C comprises three key modules: (a) a "feasibility-check module that evaluates the likelihood of meeting deadlines across both edge and cloud resources; (b) a "resource allocation strategy" that maximizes energy efficiency without sacrificing the inference accuracy; and (c) a "rescue module" that enhances throughput by leveraging approximate computing to trade accuracy for latency when necessary. Our primary objective is to maximize system prolong battery lifespan, throughput, and accuracy while adhering to strict latency constraints. Experimental evaluations in the context of wearable technologies for blind and visually impaired users demonstrate that HE2C significantly improves task throughput via completing a larger number of tasks within their specified deadlines, while preserving edge device battery and maintaining prediction accuracy with minimal latency impact. These results underscore HE2C's potential as a robust solution for resource management in latency-sensitive, energy-constrained edge-to-cloud environments.

### Action Engine: An LLM-based Framework for Automatic FaaS Workflow   Generation
**Authors**: Akiharu Esashi, Pawissanutt Lertpongrujikorn, Mohsen Amini Salehi

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:54:41Z

**Summary**: Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge and difficulties in building function workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of Tool-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring that the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by feeding the user-provided parameters. Our evaluations show that Action Engine can generate workflows with up to 20\% higher correctness without developer involvement. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.

### Dynamic Universal Approximation Theory: The Basic Theory for   Transformer-based Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wei Wang, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:50:09Z

**Summary**: Language models have emerged as a critical area of focus in artificial intelligence, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking innovations like ChatGPT. Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.

### Zero-Indexing Internet Search Augmented Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Guangxin He, Zonghong Dai, Jiangcheng Zhu, Binqiang Zhao, Chenyue Li, You Peng, Chen Wang, Binhang Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:31:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance large language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal retrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static pre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is necessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been updated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated content. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a parser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and extracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed ranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias introduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content in each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with significantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a production environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.

### A Simple and Provable Scaling Law for the Test-Time Compute of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yanxi Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:29:47Z

**Summary**: We propose a general two-stage algorithm that enjoys a provable scaling law for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). Given an input problem, the proposed algorithm first generates $N$ candidate solutions, and then chooses the best one via a multiple-round knockout tournament where each pair of candidates are compared for $K$ times and only the winners move on to the next round. In a minimalistic implementation, both stages can be executed with a black-box LLM alone and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model), and a total of $N \times (K + 1)$ highly parallelizable LLM calls are needed for solving an input problem. Assuming that a generated candidate solution is correct with probability $p_{\text{gen}} > 0$ and a comparison between a pair of correct and incorrect solutions identifies the right winner with probability $p_{\text{comp}} > 0.5$ (i.e., better than a random guess), we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the proposed algorithm decays to zero exponentially with respect to $N$ and $K$: $$\mathbb{P}(\text{final output is incorrect}) \le (1 - p_{\text{gen}})^N + \lceil \log_2 N \rceil e^{-2 K (p_{\text{comp}} - 0.5)^2}.$$ Our empirical results with the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark validate the technical assumptions, as well as the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and the gains from scaling up its test-time compute.

### Prompt Framework for Role-playing: Generation and Evaluation
**Authors**: Xun Liu, Zhengwei Ni

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:05:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive proficiency in natural language generation, understanding user instructions, and emulating human-like language use, which has led to significant interest in their application to role-playing scenarios. However, the manual collection of role-specific script data and the evaluation of model performance are resource-intensive processes. This project introduces a prompt-based framework designed to leverage GPT's capabilities for the generation of role-playing dialogue datasets and the evaluation of role-playing performance. To validate the effectiveness of the GPT-based generation and evaluation, we further incorporate the recall-oriented Rouge-L metric, providing an additional quantitative measure of performance.

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:50:35Z

**Summary**: Despite the considerable advancements in English LLMs, the progress in building comparable models for other languages has been hindered due to the scarcity of tailored resources. Our work aims to bridge this divide by introducing an expansive suite of resources specifically designed for the development of Indic LLMs, covering 22 languages, containing a total of 251B tokens and 74.8M instruction-response pairs. Recognizing the importance of both data quality and quantity, our approach combines highly curated manually verified data, unverified yet valuable data, and synthetic data. We build a clean, open-source pipeline for curating pre-training data from diverse sources, including websites, PDFs, and videos, incorporating best practices for crawling, cleaning, flagging, and deduplication. For instruction-fine tuning, we amalgamate existing Indic datasets, translate/transliterate English datasets into Indian languages, and utilize LLaMa2 and Mixtral models to create conversations grounded in articles from Indian Wikipedia and Wikihow. Additionally, we address toxicity alignment by generating toxic prompts for multiple scenarios and then generate non-toxic responses by feeding these toxic prompts to an aligned LLaMa2 model. We hope that the datasets, tools, and resources released as a part of this work will not only propel the research and development of Indic LLMs but also establish an open-source blueprint for extending such efforts to other languages. The data and other artifacts created as part of this work are released with permissive licenses.

### Weighted Particle-Based Optimization for Efficient Generalized Posterior   Calibration
**Authors**: Masahiro Tanaka

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:39:57Z

**Summary**: In the realm of statistical learning, the increasing volume of accessible data and increasing model complexity necessitate robust methodologies. This paper explores two branches of robust Bayesian methods in response to this trend. The first is generalized Bayesian inference, which introduces a learning rate parameter to enhance robustness against model misspecifications. The second is Gibbs posterior inference, which formulates inferential problems using generic loss functions rather than probabilistic models. In such approaches, it is necessary to calibrate the spread of the posterior distribution by selecting a learning rate parameter. The study aims to enhance the generalized posterior calibration (GPC) algorithm proposed by [1]. Their algorithm chooses the learning rate to achieve the nominal frequentist coverage probability, but it is computationally intensive because it requires repeated posterior simulations for bootstrap samples. We propose a more efficient version of the GPC inspired by sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers. A target distribution with a different learning rate is evaluated without posterior simulation as in the reweighting step in SMC sampling. Thus, the proposed algorithm can reach the desirable value within a few iterations. This improvement substantially reduces the computational cost of the GPC. Its efficacy is demonstrated through synthetic and real data applications.

### Random Feature Models with Learnable Activation Functions
**Authors**: Zailin Ma, Jiansheng Yang, Yaodong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:38:12Z

**Summary**: Current random feature models typically rely on fixed activation functions, limiting their ability to capture diverse patterns in data. To address this, we introduce the Random Feature model with Learnable Activation Functions (RFLAF), a novel model that significantly enhances the expressivity and interpretability of traditional random feature (RF) models. We begin by studying the RF model with a single radial basis function, where we discover a new kernel and provide the first theoretical analysis on it. By integrating the basis functions with learnable weights, we show that RFLAF can represent a broad class of random feature models whose activation functions belong in $C_c(\mathbb{R})$. Theoretically, we prove that the model requires only about twice the parameter number compared to a traditional RF model to achieve the significant leap in expressivity. Experimentally, RFLAF demonstrates two key advantages: (1) it performs better across various tasks compared to traditional RF model with the same number of parameters, and (2) the optimized weights offer interpretability, as the learned activation function can be directly inferred from these weights. Our model paves the way for developing more expressive and interpretable frameworks within random feature models.

### Towards Understanding Retrieval Accuracy and Prompt Quality in RAG   Systems
**Authors**: Shengming Zhao, Yuheng Huang, Jiayang Song, Zhijie Wang, Chengcheng Wan, Lei Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:25:31Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pivotal technique for enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) and has demonstrated promising efficacy across a diverse spectrum of tasks. While LLM-driven RAG systems show superior performance, they face unique challenges in stability and reliability. Their complexity hinders developers' efforts to design, maintain, and optimize effective RAG systems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how RAG's performance is impacted by its design. In this work, we conduct an early exploratory study toward a better understanding of the mechanism of RAG systems, covering three code datasets, three QA datasets, and two LLMs. We focus on four design factors: retrieval document type, retrieval recall, document selection, and prompt techniques. Our study uncovers how each factor impacts system correctness and confidence, providing valuable insights for developing an accurate and reliable RAG system. Based on these findings, we present nine actionable guidelines for detecting defects and optimizing the performance of RAG systems. We hope our early exploration can inspire further advancements in engineering, improving and maintaining LLM-driven intelligent software systems for greater efficiency and reliability.

### Robust Bayesian Scene Reconstruction by Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented   Priors
**Authors**: Herbert Wright, Weiming Zhi, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Tucker Hermans

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:14:17Z

**Summary**: Constructing 3D representations of object geometry is critical for many downstream manipulation tasks. These representations must be built from potentially noisy partial observations. In this work we focus on the problem of reconstructing a multi-object scene from a single RGBD image. Current deep learning approaches to this problem can be brittle to noisy real world observations and out-of-distribution objects. Other approaches that do not rely on training data cannot accurately infer the backside of objects. We propose BRRP, a reconstruction method that can leverage preexisting mesh datasets to build an informative prior during robust probabilistic reconstruction. In order to make our method more efficient, we introduce the concept of retrieval-augmented prior, where we retrieve relevant components of our prior distribution during inference. Our method produces a distribution over object shape that can be used for reconstruction or measuring uncertainty. We evaluate our method in both procedurally generated scenes and in real world scenes. We show our method is more robust than a deep learning approach while being more accurate than a method with an uninformative prior.

### Fleximo: Towards Flexible Text-to-Human Motion Video Generation
**Authors**: Yuhang Zhang, Yuan Zhou, Zeyu Liu, Yuxuan Cai, Qiuyue Wang, Aidong Men, Huan Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:09:13Z

**Summary**: Current methods for generating human motion videos rely on extracting pose sequences from reference videos, which restricts flexibility and control. Additionally, due to the limitations of pose detection techniques, the extracted pose sequences can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to low-quality video outputs. We introduce a novel task aimed at generating human motion videos solely from reference images and natural language. This approach offers greater flexibility and ease of use, as text is more accessible than the desired guidance videos. However, training an end-to-end model for this task requires millions of high-quality text and human motion video pairs, which are challenging to obtain. To address this, we propose a new framework called Fleximo, which leverages large-scale pre-trained text-to-3D motion models. This approach is not straightforward, as the text-generated skeletons may not consistently match the scale of the reference image and may lack detailed information. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an anchor point based rescale method and design a skeleton adapter to fill in missing details and bridge the gap between text-to-motion and motion-to-video generation. We also propose a video refinement process to further enhance video quality. A large language model (LLM) is employed to decompose natural language into discrete motion sequences, enabling the generation of motion videos of any desired length. To assess the performance of Fleximo, we introduce a new benchmark called MotionBench, which includes 400 videos across 20 identities and 20 motions. We also propose a new metric, MotionScore, to evaluate the accuracy of motion following. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-conditioned image-to-video generation methods. All code and model weights will be made publicly available.

### Beyond Surface Structure: A Causal Assessment of LLMs' Comprehension   Ability
**Authors**: Yujin Han, Lei Xu, Sirui Chen, Difan Zou, Chaochao Lu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T03:57:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in natural language tasks, yet debate persists on whether they truly comprehend deep structure (i.e., core semantics) or merely rely on surface structure (e.g., presentation format). Prior studies observe that LLMs' performance declines when intervening on surface structure, arguing their success relies on surface structure recognition. However, surface structure sensitivity does not prevent deep structure comprehension. Rigorously evaluating LLMs' capability requires analyzing both, yet deep structure is often overlooked. To this end, we assess LLMs' comprehension ability using causal mediation analysis, aiming to fully discover the capability of using both deep and surface structures. Specifically, we formulate the comprehension of deep structure as direct causal effect (DCE) and that of surface structure as indirect causal effect (ICE), respectively. To address the non-estimability of original DCE and ICE -- stemming from the infeasibility of isolating mutual influences of deep and surface structures, we develop the corresponding quantifiable surrogates, including approximated DCE (ADCE) and approximated ICE (AICE). We further apply the ADCE to evaluate a series of mainstream LLMs, showing that most of them exhibit deep structure comprehension ability, which grows along with the prediction accuracy. Comparing ADCE and AICE demonstrates closed-source LLMs rely more on deep structure, while open-source LLMs are more surface-sensitive, which decreases with model scale. Theoretically, ADCE is a bidirectional evaluation, which measures both the sufficiency and necessity of deep structure changes in causing output variations, thus offering a more comprehensive assessment than accuracy, a common evaluation in LLMs. Our work provides new insights into LLMs' deep structure comprehension and offers novel methods for LLMs evaluation.

### Freeze-Omni: A Smart and Low Latency Speech-to-speech Dialogue Model   with Frozen LLM
**Authors**: Xiong Wang, Yangze Li, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Lei Xie, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Long Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T03:49:55Z

**Summary**: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.

**Summary**: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data. The code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.

### Critical Tokens Matter: Token-Level Contrastive Estimation Enhence LLM's   Reasoning Capability
**Authors**: Zicheng Lin, Tian Liang, Jiahao Xu, Xing Wang, Ruilin Luo, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Yujiu Yang, Zhaopeng Tu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:58:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.

**Authors**: Wenjia Wang, Liang Pan, Zhiyang Dou, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Yuke Lou, Lei Yang, Jingbo Wang, Taku Komura

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T18:36:15Z

**Summary**: Simulating long-term human-scene interaction is a challenging yet fascinating task. Previous works have not effectively addressed the generation of long-term human scene interactions with detailed narratives for physics-based animation. This paper introduces a novel framework for the planning and controlling of long-horizon physical plausible human-scene interaction. On the one hand, films and shows with stylish human locomotions or interactions with scenes are abundantly available on the internet, providing a rich source of data for script planning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate logical storylines.   This motivates us to marry the two by using an LLM-based pipeline to extract scripts from videos, and then employ LLMs to imitate and create new scripts, capturing complex, time-series human behaviors and interactions with environments. By leveraging this, we utilize a dual-aware policy that achieves both language comprehension and scene understanding to guide character motions within contextual and spatial constraints. To facilitate training and evaluation, we contribute a comprehensive planning dataset containing diverse motion sequences extracted from real-world videos and expand them with large language models. We also collect and re-annotate motion clips from existing kinematic datasets to enable our policy learn diverse skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and its generalization ability to various scenarios, showing remarkably enhanced performance compared with existing methods. Our code and data will be publicly available soon.

### PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains
**Authors**: Vedant Khandelwal, Amit Sheth, Forest Agostinelli

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:52:39Z

**Summary**: Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains. While recent advancements have leveraged generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for domain creation, these efforts have predominantly focused on translating existing domains from natural language descriptions rather than generating novel ones. In contrast, the concept of domain randomization, which has been highly effective in reinforcement learning, enhances performance and generalizability by training on a diverse array of randomized new domains. Inspired by this success, our tool, PDDLFuse, aims to bridge this gap in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDLFuse is designed to generate new, diverse planning domains that can be used to validate new planners or test foundational planning models. We have developed methods to adjust the domain generators parameters to modulate the difficulty of the domains it generates. This adaptability is crucial as existing domain-independent planners often struggle with more complex problems. Initial tests indicate that PDDLFuse efficiently creates intricate and varied domains, representing a significant advancement over traditional domain generation methods and making a contribution towards planning research.

### LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference   A!acks leveraging internal LLM states
**Authors**: Luis Ibanez-Lissen, Lorena Gonzalez-Manzano, Jose Maria de Fuentes, Nicolas Anciaux, Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:38:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.

### AIDetx: a compression-based method for identification of   machine-learning generated text
**Authors**: Leonardo Almeida, Pedro Rodrigues, Diogo Magalhães, Armando J. Pinho, Diogo Pratas

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:31:42Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces AIDetx, a novel method for detecting machine-generated text using data compression techniques. Traditional approaches, such as deep learning classifiers, often suffer from high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a compression-based classification framework that leverages finite-context models (FCMs). AIDetx constructs distinct compression models for human-written and AI-generated text, classifying new inputs based on which model achieves a higher compression ratio. We evaluated AIDetx on two benchmark datasets, achieving F1 scores exceeding 97% and 99%, respectively, highlighting its high accuracy. Compared to current methods, such as large language models (LLMs), AIDetx offers a more interpretable and computationally efficient solution, significantly reducing both training time and hardware requirements (e.g., no GPUs needed). The full implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/AIDetx/AIDetx.

### Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners
**Authors**: Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zifeng Wang, Hamid Palangi, Rujun Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Long Le, Vincent Perot, Swaroop Mishra, Mohit Bansal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:27:05Z

**Summary**: Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

### Cross-Domain Recommendation Meets Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ajay Krishna Vajjala, Dipak Meher, Ziwei Zhu, David S. Rosenblum

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:25:00Z

**Summary**: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution to the cold-start problem, faced by single-domain recommender systems. However, existing CDR models rely on complex neural architectures, large datasets, and significant computational resources, making them less effective in data-scarce scenarios or when simplicity is crucial. In this work, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and explore their performance in the CDR domain across multiple domain pairs. We introduce two novel prompt designs tailored for CDR and demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted effectively, outperform state-of-the-art CDR baselines across various metrics and domain combinations in the rating prediction and ranking tasks. This work bridges the gap between LLMs and recommendation systems, showcasing their potential as effective cross-domain recommenders.

### Multi-label Sequential Sentence Classification via Large Language Model
**Authors**: Mengfei Lan, Lecheng Zheng, Shufan Ming, Halil Kilicoglu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T17:18:49Z

**Summary**: Sequential sentence classification (SSC) in scientific publications is crucial for supporting downstream tasks such as fine-grained information retrieval and extractive summarization. However, current SSC methods are constrained by model size, sequence length, and single-label setting. To address these limitations, this paper proposes LLM-SSC, a large language model (LLM)-based framework for both single- and multi-label SSC tasks. Unlike previous approaches that employ small- or medium-sized language models, the proposed framework utilizes LLMs to generate SSC labels through designed prompts, which enhance task understanding by incorporating demonstrations and a query to describe the prediction target. We also present a multi-label contrastive learning loss with auto-weighting scheme, enabling the multi-label classification task. To support our multi-label SSC analysis, we introduce and release a new dataset, biorc800, which mainly contains unstructured abstracts in the biomedical domain with manual annotations. Experiments demonstrate LLM-SSC's strong performance in SSC under both in-context learning and task-specific tuning settings. We release biorc800 and our code at: https://github.com/ScienceNLP-Lab/LLM-SSC.

### Sensitive Content Classification in Social Media: A Holistic Resource   and Evaluation
**Authors**: Dimosthenis Antypas, Indira Sen, Carla Perez-Almendros, Jose Camacho-Collados, Francesco Barbieri

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:44:02Z

**Summary**: The detection of sensitive content in large datasets is crucial for ensuring that shared and analysed data is free from harmful material. However, current moderation tools, such as external APIs, suffer from limitations in customisation, accuracy across diverse sensitive categories, and privacy concerns. Additionally, existing datasets and open-source models focus predominantly on toxic language, leaving gaps in detecting other sensitive categories such as substance abuse or self-harm. In this paper, we put forward a unified dataset tailored for social media content moderation across six sensitive categories: conflictual language, profanity, sexually explicit material, drug-related content, self-harm, and spam. By collecting and annotating data with consistent retrieval strategies and guidelines, we address the shortcomings of previous focalised research. Our analysis demonstrates that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on this novel dataset yields significant improvements in detection performance compared to open off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA, and even proprietary OpenAI models, which underperform by 10-15% overall. This limitation is even more pronounced on popular moderation APIs, which cannot be easily tailored to specific sensitive content categories, among others.

### Recent Advances of Foundation Language Models-based Continual Learning:   A Survey
**Authors**: Yutao Yang, Jie Zhou, Xuanwen Ding, Tianyu Huai, Shunyu Liu, Qin Chen, Yuan Xie, Liang He

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:19:01Z

**Summary**: Recently, foundation language models (LMs) have marked significant achievements in the domains of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Unlike traditional neural network models, foundation LMs obtain a great ability for transfer learning by acquiring rich commonsense knowledge through pre-training on extensive unsupervised datasets with a vast number of parameters. However, they still can not emulate human-like continuous learning due to catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, various continual learning (CL)-based methodologies have been developed to refine LMs, enabling them to adapt to new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, a systematic taxonomy of existing approaches and a comparison of their performance are still lacking, which is the gap that our survey aims to fill. We delve into a comprehensive review, summarization, and classification of the existing literature on CL-based approaches applied to foundation language models, such as pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We divide these studies into offline CL and online CL, which consist of traditional methods, parameter-efficient-based methods, instruction tuning-based methods and continual pre-training methods. Offline CL encompasses domain-incremental learning, task-incremental learning, and class-incremental learning, while online CL is subdivided into hard task boundary and blurry task boundary settings. Additionally, we outline the typical datasets and metrics employed in CL research and provide a detailed analysis of the challenges and future work for LMs-based continual learning.

### Think Beyond Size: Adaptive Prompting for More Effective Reasoning
**Authors**: Kamesh R

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:18:29Z

**Summary**: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to their impressive capabilities as few-shot learners. Recent techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, have significantly advanced multi-step reasoning by introducing step-by-step decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, these approaches often rely on static prompting templates that do not adapt to task complexity or errors during the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Prompting, a dynamic and iterative framework designed to enhance reasoning by incorporating real-time adjustments to prompt structures and validation mechanisms.Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Prompting significantly improves performance on diverse reasoning benchmarks, including arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, MultiArith), logical reasoning and commonsense tasks, achieving substantial accuracy gains compared to static prompting baselines. By integrating guided prompts, intermediate validation, and self-corrective steps, our approach enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger counterparts, such as GPT-4, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework achieves this without requiring fine-tuning or task-specific training data, highlighting the untapped potential of iterative reasoning methods.

### Advanced System Integration: Analyzing OpenAPI Chunking for   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Robin D. Pesl, Jerin G. Mathew, Massimo Mecella, Marco Aiello

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:09:43Z

**Summary**: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score.

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T16:03:14Z

**Summary**: The performance differential of large language models (LLM) between languages hinders their effective deployment in many regions, inhibiting the potential economic and societal value of generative AI tools in many communities. However, the development of functional LLMs in many languages (\ie, multilingual LLMs) is bottlenecked by the lack of high-quality evaluation resources in languages other than English. Moreover, current practices in multilingual benchmark construction often translate English resources, ignoring the regional and cultural knowledge of the environments in which multilingual systems would be used. In this work, we construct an evaluation suite of 197,243 QA pairs from local exam sources to measure the capabilities of multilingual LLMs in a variety of regional contexts. Our novel resource, INCLUDE, is a comprehensive knowledge- and reasoning-centric benchmark across 44 written languages that evaluates multilingual LLMs for performance in the actual language environments where they would be deployed.

### A Survey on Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:51:23Z

**Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better than GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

### Cherry on Top: Parameter Heterogeneity and Quantization in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Wanyun Cui, Qianle Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:49:20Z

**Summary**: This paper reveals the phenomenon of parameter heterogeneity in large language models (LLMs). We find that a small subset of "cherry" parameters exhibit a disproportionately large influence on model performance, while the vast majority of parameters have minimal impact. This heterogeneity is found to be prevalent across different model families, scales, and types. Motivated by this observation, we propose CherryQ, a novel quantization method that unifies the optimization of mixed-precision parameters. CherryQ identifies and preserves the critical cherry parameters in high precision while aggressively quantizing the remaining parameters to low precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CherryQ. CherryQ outperforms existing quantization approaches in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance. Notably, our 3-bit quantized Vicuna-1.5 exhibits competitive performance compared to their 16-bit counterparts.

### PerLA: Perceptive 3D Language Assistant
**Authors**: Guofeng Mei, Wei Lin, Luigi Riz, Yujiao Wu, Fabio Poiesi, Yiming Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:20:29Z

**Summary**: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning.\url{https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/}

### LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware   Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos
**Authors**: Tiantian Geng, Jinrui Zhang, Qingni Wang, Teng Wang, Jinming Duan, Feng Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:18:06Z

**Summary**: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.

### Dual Risk Minimization: Towards Next-Level Robustness in Fine-tuning   Zero-Shot Models
**Authors**: Kaican Li, Weiyan Xie, Yongxiang Huang, Didan Deng, Lanqing Hong, Zhenguo Li, Ricardo Silva, Nevin L. Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T15:01:25Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning foundation models often compromises their robustness to distribution shifts. To remedy this, most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pre-trained features. However, not all pre-trained features are robust and those methods are largely indifferent to which ones to preserve. We propose dual risk minimization (DRM), which combines empirical risk minimization with worst-case risk minimization, to better preserve the core features of downstream tasks. In particular, we utilize core-feature descriptions generated by LLMs to induce core-based zero-shot predictions which then serve as proxies to estimate the worst-case risk. DRM balances two crucial aspects of model robustness: expected performance and worst-case performance, establishing a new state of the art on various real-world benchmarks. DRM significantly improves the out-of-distribution performance of CLIP ViT-L/14@336 on ImageNet (75.9 to 77.1), WILDS-iWildCam (47.1 to 51.8), and WILDS-FMoW (50.7 to 53.1); opening up new avenues for robust fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/vaynexie/DRM .

### HVAC-DPT: A Decision Pretrained Transformer for HVAC Control
**Authors**: Anaïs Berkes

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:46:37Z

**Summary**: Building operations consume approximately 40% of global energy, with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems responsible for up to 50% of this consumption. As HVAC energy demands are expected to rise, optimising system efficiency is crucial for reducing future energy use and mitigating climate change. Existing control strategies lack generalisation and require extensive training and data, limiting their rapid deployment across diverse buildings. This paper introduces HVAC-DPT, a Decision-Pretrained Transformer using in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-zone HVAC control. HVAC-DPT frames HVAC control as a sequential prediction task, training a causal transformer on interaction histories generated by diverse RL agents. This approach enables HVAC-DPT to refine its policy in-context, without modifying network parameters, allowing for deployment across different buildings without the need for additional training or data collection. HVAC-DPT reduces energy consumption in unseen buildings by 45% compared to the baseline controller, offering a scalable and effective approach to mitigating the increasing environmental impact of HVAC systems.

### Evaluating the Data Model Robustness of Text-to-SQL Systems Based on   Real User Queries
**Authors**: Jonathan Fürst, Catherine Kosten, Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Yi Zhang, Kurt Stockinger

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:44:27Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models. For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models. We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments. Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.

**Authors**: Navid Salami Pargoo, Mahshid Ghasemi, Shuren Xia, Mehmet Kerem Turkcan, Taqiya Ehsan, Chengbo Zang, Yuan Sun, Javad Ghaderi, Gil Zussman, Zoran Kostic, Jorge Ortiz

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T14:02:00Z

**Summary**: As urban populations grow, cities are becoming more complex, driving the deployment of interconnected sensing systems to realize the vision of smart cities. These systems aim to improve safety, mobility, and quality of life through applications that integrate diverse sensors with real-time decision-making. Streetscape applications-focusing on challenges like pedestrian safety and adaptive traffic management-depend on managing distributed, heterogeneous sensor data, aligning information across time and space, and enabling real-time processing. These tasks are inherently complex and often difficult to scale. The Streetscape Application Services Stack (SASS) addresses these challenges with three core services: multimodal data synchronization, spatiotemporal data fusion, and distributed edge computing. By structuring these capabilities as clear, composable abstractions with clear semantics, SASS allows developers to scale streetscape applications efficiently while minimizing the complexity of multimodal integration.   We evaluated SASS in two real-world testbed environments: a controlled parking lot and an urban intersection in a major U.S. city. These testbeds allowed us to test SASS under diverse conditions, demonstrating its practical applicability. The Multimodal Data Synchronization service reduced temporal misalignment errors by 88%, achieving synchronization accuracy within 50 milliseconds. Spatiotemporal Data Fusion service improved detection accuracy for pedestrians and vehicles by over 10%, leveraging multicamera integration. The Distributed Edge Computing service increased system throughput by more than an order of magnitude. Together, these results show how SASS provides the abstractions and performance needed to support real-time, scalable urban applications, bridging the gap between sensing infrastructure and actionable streetscape intelligence.

### Know Your RAG: Dataset Taxonomy and Generation Strategies for Evaluating   RAG Systems
**Authors**: Rafael Teixeira de Lima, Shubham Gupta, Cesar Berrospi, Lokesh Mishra, Michele Dolfi, Peter Staar, Panagiotis Vagenas

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:57:07Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are a widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the industry. While many tools exist empowering developers to build their own systems, measuring their performance locally, with datasets reflective of the system's use cases, is a technological challenge. Solutions to this problem range from non-specific and cheap (most public datasets) to specific and costly (generating data from local documents). In this paper, we show that using public question and answer (Q&A) datasets to assess retrieval performance can lead to non-optimal systems design, and that common tools for RAG dataset generation can lead to unbalanced data. We propose solutions to these issues based on the characterization of RAG datasets through labels and through label-targeted data generation. Finally, we show that fine-tuned small LLMs can efficiently generate Q&A datasets. We believe that these observations are invaluable to the know-your-data step of RAG systems development.

### Challenges and Opportunities for Global Cellular Connectivity
**Authors**: Viktoria Vomhoff, Hyunseok Daniel Jang, Matteo Varvello, Stefan Geißler, Yasir Zaki, Tobias Hoßfeld, Andra Lutu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:56:07Z

**Summary**: Traditional cellular service was designed for global connectivity, but business and logistical constraints led to its fragmentation, with deployments limited to individual countries and regions. Initiatives like Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), Mobile Network Aggregators (MNAs), and regulations like ''roam-like-at-home'' have partially restored global service potential, though often at high costs in terms of user bills, application performance, and traffic efficiency. This paper makes two key contributions: first, it surveys the global cellular ecosystem, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of major players using data from prior research, proprietary datasets, and public sources. Second, it argues that the technology for seamless global service exists in Local Breakout (LBO), a roaming architecture which allows user traffic to be routed directly to the Internet through the visited network, bypassing the home network and/or third-party infrastructures. However, LBO adoption is hindered by issues such as policy enforcement, billing, and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, rooted in a lack of trust between operators. The paper concludes by exploring technological advances that could enable LBO, and pave the way for truly global cellular connectivity.

### MIMDE: Exploring the Use of Synthetic vs Human Data for Evaluating   Multi-Insight Multi-Document Extraction Tasks
**Authors**: John Francis, Saba Esnaashari, Anton Poletaev, Sukankana Chakraborty, Youmna Hashem, Jonathan Bright

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:24:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text analysis tasks, yet their evaluation on complex, real-world applications remains challenging. We define a set of tasks, Multi-Insight Multi-Document Extraction (MIMDE) tasks, which involves extracting an optimal set of insights from a document corpus and mapping these insights back to their source documents. This task is fundamental to many practical applications, from analyzing survey responses to processing medical records, where identifying and tracing key insights across documents is crucial. We develop an evaluation framework for MIMDE and introduce a novel set of complementary human and synthetic datasets to examine the potential of synthetic data for LLM evaluation. After establishing optimal metrics for comparing extracted insights, we benchmark 20 state-of-the-art LLMs on both datasets. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation (0.71) between the ability of LLMs to extracts insights on our two datasets but synthetic data fails to capture the complexity of document-level analysis. These findings offer crucial guidance for the use of synthetic data in evaluating text analysis systems, highlighting both its potential and limitations.

### SURE-VQA: Systematic Understanding of Robustness Evaluation in Medical   VQA Tasks
**Authors**: Kim-Celine Kahl, Selen Erkan, Jeremias Traub, Carsten T. Lüth, Klaus Maier-Hein, Lena Maier-Hein, Paul F. Jaeger

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T13:22:52Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts on unseen data remains a critical concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations, limiting their ability to accurately assess model robustness. To address this gap, our work introduces a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key requirements to overcome the current pitfalls and systematically analyze the robustness of VLMs: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, robustness should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the robustness of various fine-tuning methods across three medical datasets with four different types of distribution shifts. Our study reveals several important findings: 1) Sanity baselines that do not utilize image data can perform surprisingly well; 2) We confirm LoRA as the best-performing PEFT method; 3) No PEFT method consistently outperforms others in terms of robustness to shifts.

### ChineseWebText 2.0: Large-Scale High-quality Chinese Web Text with   Multi-dimensional and fine-grained information
**Authors**: Wanyue Zhang, Ziyong Li, Wen Yang, Chunlin Leng, Yinan Bai, Qianlong Du, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:48:49Z

**Summary**: During the development of large language models (LLMs), pre-training data play a critical role in shaping LLMs' capabilities. In recent years several large-scale and high-quality pre-training datasets have been released to accelerate the research of LLMs, including ChineseWebText1.0, C4, Pile, WanJuan, MAPCC and others. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, focus has increasingly shifted to domain-specific capabilities and safety concerns, making those previous coarse-grained texts insufficient for meeting training requirements. Furthermore, fine-grained information, such as quality, domain and toxicity, is becoming increasingly important in building powerful and reliable LLMs for various scenarios. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a new tool-chain called MDFG-tool for constructing large-scale and high-quality Chinese datasets with multi-dimensional and fine-grained information. First, we employ manually crafted rules to discard explicit noisy texts from raw contents. Second, the quality evaluation model, domain classifier, and toxicity evaluation model are well-designed to assess the remaining cleaned data respectively. Finally, we integrate these three types of fine-grained information for each text. With this approach, we release the largest, high-quality and fine-grained Chinese text ChineseWebText2.0, which consists of 3.8TB and each text is associated with a quality score, domain labels, a toxicity label and a toxicity score, facilitating the LLM researchers to select data based on various types of fine-grained information. The data, codes and the tool-chain are available on this website https://github.com/CASIA-LM/ChineseWebText-2.0

### DCIM-AVSR : Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Dual Conformer   Interaction Module
**Authors**: Xinyu Wang, Qian Wang, Haotian Jiang, Haolin Huang, Yu Fang, Mengjie Xu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:34:51Z

**Summary**: Speech recognition is the technology that enables machines to interpret and process human speech, converting spoken language into text or commands. This technology is essential for applications such as virtual assistants, transcription services, and communication tools. The Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) model enhances traditional speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments, by incorporating visual modalities like lip movements and facial expressions. While traditional AVSR models trained on large-scale datasets with numerous parameters can achieve remarkable accuracy, often surpassing human performance, they also come with high training costs and deployment challenges. To address these issues, we introduce an efficient AVSR model that reduces the number of parameters through the integration of a Dual Conformer Interaction Module (DCIM). In addition, we propose a pre-training method that further optimizes model performance by selectively updating parameters, leading to significant improvements in efficiency. Unlike conventional models that require the system to independently learn the hierarchical relationship between audio and visual modalities, our approach incorporates this distinction directly into the model architecture. This design enhances both efficiency and performance, resulting in a more practical and effective solution for AVSR tasks.

### GPTuner: A Manual-Reading Database Tuning System via GPT-Guided Bayesian   Optimization
**Authors**: Jiale Lao, Yibo Wang, Yufei Li, Jianping Wang, Yunjia Zhang, Zhiyuan Cheng, Wanghu Chen, Mingjie Tang, Jianguo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:33:45Z

**Summary**: Modern database management systems (DBMS) expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviours. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance is a long-standing problem in the database community. As there is an increasing number of knobs to tune and each knob could be in continuous or categorical values, manual tuning becomes impractical. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods have shown great potentials. However, existing approaches still incur significant tuning costs or only yield sub-optimal performance. This is because they either ignore the extensive domain knowledge available (e.g., DBMS manuals and forum discussions) and only rely on the runtime feedback of benchmark evaluations to guide the optimization, or they utilize the domain knowledge in a limited way. Hence, we propose GPTuner, a manual-reading database tuning system. Firstly, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline to collect and refine heterogeneous knowledge, and propose a prompt ensemble algorithm to unify a structured view of the refined knowledge. Secondly, using the structured knowledge, we (1) design a workload-aware and training-free knob selection strategy, (2) develop a search space optimization technique considering the value range of each knob, and (3) propose a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space. Finally, we evaluate GPTuner under different benchmarks (TPC-C and TPC-H), metrics (throughput and latency) as well as DBMS (PostgreSQL and MySQL). Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, GPTuner identifies better configurations in 16x less time on average. Moreover, GPTuner achieves up to 30% performance improvement (higher throughput or lower latency) over the best-performing alternative.

### Truth or Mirage? Towards End-to-End Factuality Evaluation with LLM-OASIS
**Authors**: Alessandro Scirè, Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Simone Tedeschi, Karim Ghonim, Federico Martelli, Roberto Navigli

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:21:15Z

**Summary**: After the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been substantial improvements in the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Text Summarization and Machine Translation. However, LLMs still produce outputs containing hallucinations, that is, content not grounded in factual information. Therefore, developing methods to assess the factuality of LLMs has become urgent.   Indeed, resources for factuality evaluation have recently emerged. Although challenging, these resources face one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are tailored to a specific task or domain; (ii) they are limited in size, thereby preventing the training of new factuality evaluators; (iii) they are designed for simpler verification tasks, such as claim verification.   To address these issues, we introduce LLM-Oasis, to the best of our knowledge the largest resource for training end-to-end factuality evaluators. LLM-Oasis is constructed by extracting claims from Wikipedia, falsifying a subset of these claims, and generating pairs of factual and unfactual texts. We then rely on human annotators to both validate the quality of our dataset and to create a gold standard test set for benchmarking factuality evaluation systems.   Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Oasis presents a significant challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs, with GPT-4o achieving up to 60% accuracy in our proposed end-to-end factuality evaluation task, highlighting its potential to drive future research in the field.

### Enhancing Security in Third-Party Library Reuse -- Comprehensive   Detection of 1-day Vulnerability through Code Patch Analysis
**Authors**: Shangzhi Xu, Jialiang Dong, Weiting Cai, Juanru Li, Arash Shaghaghi, Nan Sun, Siqi Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T12:02:28Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, software development progresses rapidly to incorporate new features. To facilitate such growth and provide convenience for developers when creating and updating software, reusing open-source software (i.e., thirdparty library reuses) has become one of the most effective and efficient methods. Unfortunately, the practice of reusing third-party libraries (TPLs) can also introduce vulnerabilities (known as 1-day vulnerabilities) because of the low maintenance of TPLs, resulting in many vulnerable versions remaining in use. If the software incorporating these TPLs fails to detect the introduced vulnerabilities and leads to delayed updates, it will exacerbate the security risks. However, the complicated code dependencies and flexibility of TPL reuses make the detection of 1-day vulnerability a challenging task. To support developers in securely reusing TPLs during software development, we design and implement VULTURE, an effective and efficient detection tool, aiming at identifying 1-day vulnerabilities that arise from the reuse of vulnerable TPLs. It first executes a database creation method, TPLFILTER, which leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically build a unique database for the targeted platform. Instead of relying on code-level similarity comparison, VULTURE employs hashing-based comparison to explore the dependencies among the collected TPLs and identify the similarities between the TPLs and the target projects. Recognizing that developers have the flexibility to reuse TPLs exactly or in a custom manner, VULTURE separately conducts version-based comparison and chunk-based analysis to capture fine-grained semantic features at the function levels. We applied VULTURE to 10 real-world projects to assess its effectiveness and efficiency in detecting 1-day vulnerabilities. VULTURE successfully identified 175 vulnerabilities from 178 reused TPLs.

### Steering Large Language Models using Conceptors: Improving   Addition-Based Activation Engineering
**Authors**: Joris Postmus, Steven Abreu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:52:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.

### OneBit: Towards Extremely Low-bit Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuzhuang Xu, Xu Han, Zonghan Yang, Shuo Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiyuan Liu, Weidong Liu, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:47:55Z

**Summary**: Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of existing models to be quantized, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, current quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit model compressing framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the quantization framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 81% of the non-quantized performance on LLaMA models) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.

### LLM Teacher-Student Framework for Text Classification With No Manually   Annotated Data: A Case Study in IPTC News Topic Classification
**Authors**: Taja Kuzman, Nikola Ljubešić

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:42:58Z

**Summary**: With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language models (LLMs) for developing multilingual news classification models of reasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop an IPTC Media Topic training dataset through automatic annotation of news articles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. The teacher model exhibits a high zero-shot performance on all four languages. Its agreement with human annotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves. To mitigate the computational limitations associated with the requirement of processing millions of texts daily, smaller BERT-like student models are fine-tuned on the GPT-annotated dataset. These student models achieve high performance comparable to the teacher model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the training data size on the performance of the student models and investigate their monolingual, multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities. The findings indicate that student models can achieve high performance with a relatively small number of training instances, and demonstrate strong zero-shot cross-lingual abilities. Finally, we publish the best-performing news topic classifier, enabling multilingual classification with the top-level categories of the IPTC Media Topic schema.

### Build An Influential Bot In Social Media Simulations With Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Bailu Jin, Weisi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:37:12Z

**Summary**: Understanding the dynamics of public opinion evolution on online social platforms is critical for analyzing influence mechanisms. Traditional approaches to influencer analysis are typically divided into qualitative assessments of personal attributes and quantitative evaluations of influence power. In this study, we introduce a novel simulated environment that combines Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling agents to generate posts, form opinions, and update follower networks. This simulation allows for more detailed observations of how opinion leaders emerge. Additionally, we present an innovative application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replicate the process of opinion leader formation. Our findings reveal that limiting the action space and incorporating self-observation are key factors for achieving stable opinion leader generation. The learning curves demonstrate the model's capacity to identify optimal strategies and adapt to complex, unpredictable dynamics.

### When LLMs Go Online: The Emerging Threat of Web-Enabled LLMs
**Authors**: Hanna Kim, Minkyoo Song, Seung Ho Na, Seungwon Shin, Kimin Lee

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:30:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of impersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the click rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up to 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.

### LLM-Rank: A Graph Theoretical Approach to Pruning Large Language Models
**Authors**: David Hoffmann, Kailash Budhathoki, Matthaeus Kleindessner

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T11:21:29Z

**Summary**: The evolving capabilities of large language models are accompanied by growing sizes and deployment costs, necessitating effective inference optimisation techniques. We propose a novel pruning method utilising centrality measures from graph theory, reducing both the computational requirements and the memory footprint of these models. Specifically, we devise a method for creating a weighted directed acyclical graph representation of multilayer perceptrons to which we apply a modified version of the weighted PageRank centrality measure to compute node importance scores. In combination with uniform pruning this leads to structured sparsity. We call this pruning method MLPRank. Furthermore we introduce an extension to decoder-only transformer models and call it LLMRank. For both variants we demonstrate a strong performance. With MLPRank on average leading to 6.09 % higher accuracy retention than three popular baselines and 13.42 % with LLMRank compared to two popular baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/llm-rank-pruning.

### Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language   Models: What is There and What is Missing?
**Authors**: Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:46:22Z

**Summary**: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) that have revolutionized text-based NLP. This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.

**Summary**: Evaluating generalist agents presents significant challenges due to their wide-ranging abilities and the limitations of current benchmarks in assessing true generalization. We introduce the Minecraft Universe (MCU), a fully automated benchmarking framework set within the open-world game Minecraft. MCU dynamically generates and evaluates a broad spectrum of tasks, offering three core components: 1) a task generation mechanism that provides high degrees of freedom and variability, 2) an ever-expanding set of over 3K composable atomic tasks, and 3) a general evaluation framework that supports open-ended task assessment. By integrating large language models (LLMs), MCU dynamically creates diverse environments for each evaluation, fostering agent generalization. The framework uses a vision-language model (VLM) to automatically generate evaluation criteria, achieving over 90% agreement with human ratings across multi-dimensional assessments, which demonstrates that MCU is a scalable and explainable solution for evaluating generalist agents. Additionally, we show that while state-of-the-art foundational models perform well on specific tasks, they often struggle with increased task diversity and difficulty.

### Exploring Italian sentence embeddings properties through multi-tasking
**Authors**: Vivi Nastase, Giuseppe Samo, Chunyang Jiang, Paola Merlo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:30:11Z

**Summary**: We investigate to what degree existing LLMs encode abstract linguistic information in Italian in a multi-task setting. We exploit curated synthetic data on a large scale -- several Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) problems in Italian -- and use them to study how sentence representations built using pre-trained language models encode specific syntactic and semantic information. We use a two-level architecture to model separately a compression of the sentence embeddings into a representation that contains relevant information for a task, and a BLM task. We then investigate whether we can obtain compressed sentence representations that encode syntactic and semantic information relevant to several BLM tasks. While we expected that the sentence structure -- in terms of sequence of phrases/chunks -- and chunk properties could be shared across tasks, performance and error analysis show that the clues for the different tasks are encoded in different manners in the sentence embeddings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions such as constituents or thematic roles does not seem to be present in the pretrained sentence embeddings.

**Authors**: Yulei Qin, Yuncheng Yang, Pengcheng Guo, Gang Li, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Yun Gu, Ke Li, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:10:43Z

**Summary**: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies. All related contents are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fantastic-data-engineering.

### Can Large Language Models Reason about the Region Connection Calculus?
**Authors**: Anthony G Cohn, Robert E Blackwell

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:10:16Z

**Summary**: Qualitative Spatial Reasoning is a well explored area of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and has multiple applications ranging from Geographical Information Systems to Robotics and Computer Vision. Recently, many claims have been made for the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, we investigate the extent to which a set of representative LLMs can perform classical qualitative spatial reasoning tasks on the mereotopological Region Connection Calculus, RCC-8. We conduct three pairs of experiments (reconstruction of composition tables, alignment to human composition preferences, conceptual neighbourhood reconstruction) using state-of-the-art LLMs; in each pair one experiment uses eponymous relations and one, anonymous relations (to test the extent to which the LLM relies on knowledge about the relation names obtained during training). All instances are repeated 30 times to measure the stochasticity of the LLMs.

### In-Context Learning with Noisy Labels
**Authors**: Junyong Kang, Donghyun Son, Hwanjun Song, Buru Chang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:54:08Z

**Summary**: In-context learning refers to the emerging ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform a target task without additional training, utilizing demonstrations of the task. Recent studies aim to enhance in-context learning performance by selecting more useful demonstrations. However, they overlook the presence of inevitable noisy labels in task demonstrations that arise during the labeling process in the real-world. In this paper, we propose a new task, in-context learning with noisy labels, which aims to solve real-world problems for in-context learning where labels in task demonstrations would be corrupted. Moreover, we propose a new method and baseline methods for the new task, inspired by studies in learning with noisy labels. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method can serve as a safeguard against performance degradation in in-context learning caused by noisy labels.

### Deep Learning-based Code Reviews: A Paradigm Shift or a Double-Edged   Sword?
**Authors**: Rosalia Tufano, Alberto Martin-Lopez, Ahmad Tayeb, Ozren Dabić, Sonia Haiduc, Gabriele Bavota

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:48:33Z

**Summary**: Several techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Early support consisted in recommending the most suited reviewer for a given change or in prioritizing the review tasks. With the advent of deep learning in software engineering, the level of automation has been pushed to new heights, with approaches able to provide feedback on source code in natural language as a human reviewer would do. Also, recent work documented open source projects adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-reviewers. Although the research in this field is very active, little is known about the actual impact of including automatically generated code reviews in the code review process. While there are many aspects worth investigating, in this work we focus on three of them: (i) review quality, i.e., the reviewer's ability to identify issues in the code; (ii) review cost, i.e., the time spent reviewing the code; and (iii) reviewer's confidence, i.e., how confident is the reviewer about the provided feedback. We run a controlled experiment with 29 experts who reviewed different programs with/without the support of an automatically generated code review. During the experiment we monitored the reviewers' activities, for over 50 hours of recorded code reviews. We show that reviewers consider valid most of the issues automatically identified by the LLM and that the availability of an automated review as a starting point strongly influences their behavior: Reviewers tend to focus on the code locations indicated by the LLM rather than searching for additional issues in other parts of the code. The reviewers who started from an automated review identified a higher number of low-severity issues while, however, not identifying more high-severity issues as compared to a completely manual process. Finally, the automated support did not result in saved time and did not increase the reviewers' confidence.

### A Review of LLM-based Explanations in Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Alan Said

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:47:32Z

**Summary**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and ChatGPT, has opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems through improved explainability. This paper provides a systematic literature review focused on leveraging LLMs to generate explanations for recommendations -- a critical aspect for fostering transparency and user trust. We conducted a comprehensive search within the ACM Guide to Computing Literature, covering publications from the launch of ChatGPT (November 2022) to the present (November 2024). Our search yielded 232 articles, but after applying inclusion criteria, only six were identified as directly addressing the use of LLMs in explaining recommendations. This scarcity highlights that, despite the rise of LLMs, their application in explainable recommender systems is still in an early stage. We analyze these select studies to understand current methodologies, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs improving explanations of recommender systems and encourage the development of more transparent and user-centric recommendation explanation solutions.

### Ensemble Watermarks for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Georg Niess, Roman Kern

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:18:32Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between text written by humans and machines. While watermarks already exist for LLMs, they often lack flexibility, and struggle with attacks such as paraphrasing. To address these issues, we propose a multi-feature method for generating watermarks that combines multiple distinct watermark features into an ensemble watermark. Concretely, we combine acrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to achieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack the performance remains high with 95% detection rate. The red-green feature alone as baseline achieves a detection rate of 49%. The evaluation of all feature combinations reveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection rate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the flexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and trade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, for all ensemble configurations the same detection function can be used without adaptations. This method is particularly of interest to facilitate accountability and prevent societal harm.

### Evaluating Research Quality with Large Language Models: An Analysis of   ChatGPT's Effectiveness with Different Settings and Inputs
**Authors**: Mike Thelwall

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:17:29Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the quality of academic journal articles is a time consuming but critical task for national research evaluation exercises, appointments and promotion. It is therefore important to investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a role in this process. This article assesses which ChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and abstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to which scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results show that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average ChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers) correlating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is slightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest that article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even though complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple ones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough assessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and significance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model scores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing.

### Initialization using Update Approximation is a Silver Bullet for   Extremely Efficient Low-Rank Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Kaustubh Ponkshe, Raghav Singhal, Eduard Gorbunov, Alexey Tumanov, Samuel Horvath, Praneeth Vepakomma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:10:30Z

**Summary**: Low-rank adapters have become a standard approach for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a trainable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using 27-90x fewer parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RaghavSinghal10/lora-sb.

### Unimib Assistant: designing a student-friendly RAG-based chatbot for all   their needs
**Authors**: Chiara Antico, Stefano Giordano, Cansu Koyuturk, Dimitri Ognibene

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:07:21Z

**Summary**: Natural language processing skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) are unprecedented, having wide diffusion and application in different tasks. This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant.

### MH-MoE: Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Shaohan Huang, Xun Wu, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:17Z

**Summary**: Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE) demonstrates superior performance by using the multi-head mechanism to collectively attend to information from various representation spaces within different experts. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of MH-MoE that maintains both FLOPs and parameter parity with sparse Mixture of Experts models. Experimental results on language models show that the new implementation yields quality improvements over both vanilla MoE and fine-grained MoE models. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that MH-MoE is compatible with 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BitNet.

### Training Agents with Weakly Supervised Feedback from Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Dihong Gong, Pu Lu, Zelong Wang, Meng Zhou, Xiuqiang He

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:47:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising basis for creating agents that can tackle complex tasks through iterative environmental interaction. Existing methods either require these agents to mimic expert-provided trajectories or rely on definitive environmental feedback for reinforcement learning which limits their application to specific scenarios like gaming or code generation. This paper introduces a novel training method for LLM-based agents using weakly supervised signals from a critic LLM, bypassing the need for expert trajectories or definitive feedback. Our agents are trained in iterative manner, where they initially generate trajectories through environmental interaction. Subsequently, a critic LLM selects a subset of good trajectories, which are then used to update the agents, enabling them to generate improved trajectories in the next iteration. Extensive tests on the API-bank dataset show consistent improvement in our agents' capabilities and comparable performance to GPT-4, despite using open-source models with much fewer parameters.

### A dynamic parallel method for performance optimization on hybrid CPUs
**Authors**: Luo Yu, Liu Yucheng, Shen Haihao

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:39:24Z

**Summary**: The AIPC concept is gaining popularity, and more and more hybrid CPUs will be running AI models on client devices. However, the current AI inference framework overlooks the imbalanced hardware capability of hybrid CPUs, leading to low inference performance. To address this issue, we have introduced a dynamic parallel method for hybrid CPUs, which significantly increases LLM inference performance by balancing the workload for each core of a hybrid CPU before the parallel work starts. This method has enabled Neural Speed to achieve more than 90% (on average) of memory bandwidth on two hybrid Intel CPUs.

### Knowledge Management for Automobile Failure Analysis Using Graph RAG
**Authors**: Yuta Ojima, Hiroki Sakaji, Tadashi Nakamura, Hiroaki Sakata, Kazuya Seki, Yuu Teshigawara, Masami Yamashita, Kazuhiro Aoyama

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:34:07Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a knowledge management system for automobile failure analysis using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for automobile failure analysis.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### SAM Decoding: Speculative Decoding via Suffix Automaton
**Authors**: Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:16:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by unifying tasks into text generation, yet their large parameter sizes and autoregressive nature limit inference speed. SAM-Decoding addresses this by introducing a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that uses a suffix automaton for efficient and accurate draft generation. Unlike n-gram matching used by the existing method, SAM-Decoding finds the longest suffix match in generating text and text corpuss, achieving an average time complexity of $O(1)$ per generation step. SAM-Decoding constructs static and dynamic suffix automatons for the text corpus and input prompts, respectively, enabling fast and precise draft generation. Meanwhile, it is designed as an approach that can be combined with existing methods, allowing SAM-Decoding to adaptively select a draft generation strategy based on the matching length, thus increasing the inference speed of the LLM. When combined with Token Recycling, evaluations show SAM-Decoding outperforms existing model-free methods, achieving a speedup of $2.27\times$ over autoregressive decoding on Spec-Bench. When combined with EAGLE2, it reaches a speedup of $2.49\times$, surpassing all current approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding.

### RAGDiffusion: Faithful Cloth Generation via External Knowledge   Assimilation
**Authors**: Xianfeng Tan, Yuhan Li, Wenxiang Shang, Yubo Wu, Jian Wang, Xuanhong Chen, Yi Zhang, Ran Lin, Bingbing Ni

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:57:32Z

**Summary**: Standard clothing asset generation involves creating forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized sampling distributions and precise structural requirements in the generated images. Existing models have limited spatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external knowledge from LLM and databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two core processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a three-level alignment that ensures fidelity in structural, pattern, and decoding components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and detail-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Institutional Portfolio Management:   Persona-Based Ensembles
**Authors**: Yoshia Abe, Shuhei Matsuo, Ryoma Kondo, Ryohei Hisano

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:18:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in various financial applications, though their potential in complex investment strategies remains underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how LLMs can predict price movements in stock and bond portfolios using economic indicators, enabling portfolio adjustments akin to those employed by institutional investors. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating different personas within LLMs, using an ensemble approach to leverage their diverse predictions. Our findings show that LLM-based strategies, especially when combined with the mode ensemble, outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in terms of Sharpe ratio during periods of rising consumer price index (CPI). However, traditional strategies are more effective during declining CPI trends or sharp market downturns. These results suggest that while LLMs can enhance portfolio management, they may require complementary strategies to optimize performance across varying market conditions.

### On the Adversarial Robustness of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models   for Code
**Authors**: Md Imran Hossen, Xiali Hei

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T07:00:47Z

**Summary**: The advent of instruction-tuned Large Language Models designed for coding tasks (Code LLMs) has transformed software engineering practices. However, their robustness against various input challenges remains a critical concern. This study introduces DegradePrompter, a novel method designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of instruction-tuned Code LLMs. We assess the impact of diverse input challenges on the functionality and correctness of generated code using rigorous metrics and established benchmarks. Our comprehensive evaluation includes five state-of-the-art open-source models and three production-grade closed-source models, revealing varying degrees of robustness. Open-source models demonstrate an increased susceptibility to input perturbations, resulting in declines in functional correctness ranging from 12% to 34%. In contrast, commercial models demonstrate relatively greater resilience, with performance degradation ranging from 3% to 24%. To enhance the robustness of the models against these vulnerabilities, we investigate a straightforward yet effective mitigation strategy. Our findings highlight the need for robust defense mechanisms and comprehensive evaluations during both the development and deployment phases to ensure the resilience and reliability of automated code generation systems.

### Real-time Anomaly Detection at the L1 Trigger of CMS Experiment
**Authors**: Abhijith Gandrakota

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:56:42Z

**Summary**: We present the preparation, deployment, and testing of an autoencoder trained for unbiased detection of new physics signatures in the CMS experiment Global Trigger (GT) test crate FPGAs during LHC Run 3. The GT makes the final decision whether to readout or discard the data from each LHC collision, which occur at a rate of 40 MHz, within a 50 ns latency. The Neural Network makes a prediction for each event within these constraints, which can be used to select anomalous events for further analysis. The GT test crate is a copy of the main GT system, receiving the same input data, but whose output is not used to trigger the readout of CMS, providing a platform for thorough testing of new trigger algorithms on live data, but without interrupting data taking. We describe the methodology to achieve ultra low latency anomaly detection, and present the integration of the DNN into the GT test crate, as well as the monitoring, testing, and validation of the algorithm during proton collisions.

### TQA-Bench: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Table Question Answering with   Scalable Context and Symbolic Extension
**Authors**: Zipeng Qiu, You Peng, Guangxin He, Binhang Yuan, Chen Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:48:13Z

**Summary**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked great opportunities in complex data management tasks, particularly in question answering (QA) over complicated multi-table relational data. Despite significant progress, systematically evaluating LLMs on multi-table QA remains a critical challenge due to the inherent complexity of analyzing heterogeneous table structures and potential large scale of serialized relational data. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-table QA, failing to capture the intricacies of reasoning across multiple relational tables, as required in real-world domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. To address this gap, we present TQA-Bench, a new multi-table QA benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in tackling complex QA tasks over relational data. Our benchmark incorporates diverse relational database instances sourced from real-world public datasets and introduces a flexible sampling mechanism to create tasks with varying multi-table context lengths, ranging from 8K to 64K tokens. To ensure robustness and reliability, we integrate symbolic extensions into the evaluation framework, enabling the assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities beyond simple data retrieval or probabilistic pattern matching. We systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, both open-source and closed-source, spanning model scales from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive experiments reveal critical insights into the performance of LLMs in multi-table QA, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for advancing their application in complex, data-driven environments. Our benchmark implementation and results are available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/TQA-Bench.

### COLD: Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities
**Authors**: Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Ashutosh Modi

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:37:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, including arithmetic and reasoning; however, to gauge the intellectual capabilities of LLMs, causal reasoning has become a reliable proxy for validating a general understanding of the mechanics and intricacies of the world similar to humans. Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (~ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans. We further explore (the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs) using the backdoor criterion to determine the causal strength between events.

### Interleaved-Modal Chain-of-Thought
**Authors**: Jun Gao, Yongqi Li, Ziqiang Cao, Wenjie Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T06:06:35Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to produce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their text-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the original image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal Chain-of-Thought, named \textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)}, which generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and textual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT requires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal content, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the required visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose \textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs. ADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the interleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies solely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and therefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum of VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different architectures. Extensive evaluations of three benchmarks have shown that ICoT prompting achieves substantial performance (up to 14\%) and interpretability improvements compared to existing multimodal CoT prompting methods.

### Action Engine: An LLM-based Framework for Automatic FaaS Workflow   Generation
**Authors**: Akiharu Esashi, Pawissanutt Lertpongrujikorn, Mohsen Amini Salehi

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:54:41Z

**Summary**: Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge and difficulties in building function workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of Tool-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring that the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by feeding the user-provided parameters. Our evaluations show that Action Engine can generate workflows with up to 20\% higher correctness without developer involvement. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.

### Dynamic Universal Approximation Theory: The Basic Theory for   Transformer-based Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wei Wang, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:50:09Z

**Summary**: Language models have emerged as a critical area of focus in artificial intelligence, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking innovations like ChatGPT. Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.

### Zero-Indexing Internet Search Augmented Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Guangxin He, Zonghong Dai, Jiangcheng Zhu, Binqiang Zhao, Chenyue Li, You Peng, Chen Wang, Binhang Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:31:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance large language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal retrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static pre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is necessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been updated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated content. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a parser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and extracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed ranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias introduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content in each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with significantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a production environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.

### A Simple and Provable Scaling Law for the Test-Time Compute of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yanxi Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:29:47Z

**Summary**: We propose a general two-stage algorithm that enjoys a provable scaling law for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). Given an input problem, the proposed algorithm first generates $N$ candidate solutions, and then chooses the best one via a multiple-round knockout tournament where each pair of candidates are compared for $K$ times and only the winners move on to the next round. In a minimalistic implementation, both stages can be executed with a black-box LLM alone and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model), and a total of $N \times (K + 1)$ highly parallelizable LLM calls are needed for solving an input problem. Assuming that a generated candidate solution is correct with probability $p_{\text{gen}} > 0$ and a comparison between a pair of correct and incorrect solutions identifies the right winner with probability $p_{\text{comp}} > 0.5$ (i.e., better than a random guess), we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the proposed algorithm decays to zero exponentially with respect to $N$ and $K$: $$\mathbb{P}(\text{final output is incorrect}) \le (1 - p_{\text{gen}})^N + \lceil \log_2 N \rceil e^{-2 K (p_{\text{comp}} - 0.5)^2}.$$ Our empirical results with the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark validate the technical assumptions, as well as the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and the gains from scaling up its test-time compute.

### Prompt Framework for Role-playing: Generation and Evaluation
**Authors**: Xun Liu, Zhengwei Ni

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:05:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive proficiency in natural language generation, understanding user instructions, and emulating human-like language use, which has led to significant interest in their application to role-playing scenarios. However, the manual collection of role-specific script data and the evaluation of model performance are resource-intensive processes. This project introduces a prompt-based framework designed to leverage GPT's capabilities for the generation of role-playing dialogue datasets and the evaluation of role-playing performance. To validate the effectiveness of the GPT-based generation and evaluation, we further incorporate the recall-oriented Rouge-L metric, providing an additional quantitative measure of performance.

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:50:35Z

**Summary**: Despite the considerable advancements in English LLMs, the progress in building comparable models for other languages has been hindered due to the scarcity of tailored resources. Our work aims to bridge this divide by introducing an expansive suite of resources specifically designed for the development of Indic LLMs, covering 22 languages, containing a total of 251B tokens and 74.8M instruction-response pairs. Recognizing the importance of both data quality and quantity, our approach combines highly curated manually verified data, unverified yet valuable data, and synthetic data. We build a clean, open-source pipeline for curating pre-training data from diverse sources, including websites, PDFs, and videos, incorporating best practices for crawling, cleaning, flagging, and deduplication. For instruction-fine tuning, we amalgamate existing Indic datasets, translate/transliterate English datasets into Indian languages, and utilize LLaMa2 and Mixtral models to create conversations grounded in articles from Indian Wikipedia and Wikihow. Additionally, we address toxicity alignment by generating toxic prompts for multiple scenarios and then generate non-toxic responses by feeding these toxic prompts to an aligned LLaMa2 model. We hope that the datasets, tools, and resources released as a part of this work will not only propel the research and development of Indic LLMs but also establish an open-source blueprint for extending such efforts to other languages. The data and other artifacts created as part of this work are released with permissive licenses.

### Towards Understanding Retrieval Accuracy and Prompt Quality in RAG   Systems
**Authors**: Shengming Zhao, Yuheng Huang, Jiayang Song, Zhijie Wang, Chengcheng Wan, Lei Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:25:31Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pivotal technique for enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) and has demonstrated promising efficacy across a diverse spectrum of tasks. While LLM-driven RAG systems show superior performance, they face unique challenges in stability and reliability. Their complexity hinders developers' efforts to design, maintain, and optimize effective RAG systems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how RAG's performance is impacted by its design. In this work, we conduct an early exploratory study toward a better understanding of the mechanism of RAG systems, covering three code datasets, three QA datasets, and two LLMs. We focus on four design factors: retrieval document type, retrieval recall, document selection, and prompt techniques. Our study uncovers how each factor impacts system correctness and confidence, providing valuable insights for developing an accurate and reliable RAG system. Based on these findings, we present nine actionable guidelines for detecting defects and optimizing the performance of RAG systems. We hope our early exploration can inspire further advancements in engineering, improving and maintaining LLM-driven intelligent software systems for greater efficiency and reliability.

### Fleximo: Towards Flexible Text-to-Human Motion Video Generation
**Authors**: Yuhang Zhang, Yuan Zhou, Zeyu Liu, Yuxuan Cai, Qiuyue Wang, Aidong Men, Huan Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T04:09:13Z

**Summary**: Current methods for generating human motion videos rely on extracting pose sequences from reference videos, which restricts flexibility and control. Additionally, due to the limitations of pose detection techniques, the extracted pose sequences can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to low-quality video outputs. We introduce a novel task aimed at generating human motion videos solely from reference images and natural language. This approach offers greater flexibility and ease of use, as text is more accessible than the desired guidance videos. However, training an end-to-end model for this task requires millions of high-quality text and human motion video pairs, which are challenging to obtain. To address this, we propose a new framework called Fleximo, which leverages large-scale pre-trained text-to-3D motion models. This approach is not straightforward, as the text-generated skeletons may not consistently match the scale of the reference image and may lack detailed information. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an anchor point based rescale method and design a skeleton adapter to fill in missing details and bridge the gap between text-to-motion and motion-to-video generation. We also propose a video refinement process to further enhance video quality. A large language model (LLM) is employed to decompose natural language into discrete motion sequences, enabling the generation of motion videos of any desired length. To assess the performance of Fleximo, we introduce a new benchmark called MotionBench, which includes 400 videos across 20 identities and 20 motions. We also propose a new metric, MotionScore, to evaluate the accuracy of motion following. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-conditioned image-to-video generation methods. All code and model weights will be made publicly available.

### Beyond Surface Structure: A Causal Assessment of LLMs' Comprehension   Ability
**Authors**: Yujin Han, Lei Xu, Sirui Chen, Difan Zou, Chaochao Lu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T03:57:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in natural language tasks, yet debate persists on whether they truly comprehend deep structure (i.e., core semantics) or merely rely on surface structure (e.g., presentation format). Prior studies observe that LLMs' performance declines when intervening on surface structure, arguing their success relies on surface structure recognition. However, surface structure sensitivity does not prevent deep structure comprehension. Rigorously evaluating LLMs' capability requires analyzing both, yet deep structure is often overlooked. To this end, we assess LLMs' comprehension ability using causal mediation analysis, aiming to fully discover the capability of using both deep and surface structures. Specifically, we formulate the comprehension of deep structure as direct causal effect (DCE) and that of surface structure as indirect causal effect (ICE), respectively. To address the non-estimability of original DCE and ICE -- stemming from the infeasibility of isolating mutual influences of deep and surface structures, we develop the corresponding quantifiable surrogates, including approximated DCE (ADCE) and approximated ICE (AICE). We further apply the ADCE to evaluate a series of mainstream LLMs, showing that most of them exhibit deep structure comprehension ability, which grows along with the prediction accuracy. Comparing ADCE and AICE demonstrates closed-source LLMs rely more on deep structure, while open-source LLMs are more surface-sensitive, which decreases with model scale. Theoretically, ADCE is a bidirectional evaluation, which measures both the sufficiency and necessity of deep structure changes in causing output variations, thus offering a more comprehensive assessment than accuracy, a common evaluation in LLMs. Our work provides new insights into LLMs' deep structure comprehension and offers novel methods for LLMs evaluation.

### Freeze-Omni: A Smart and Low Latency Speech-to-speech Dialogue Model   with Frozen LLM
**Authors**: Xiong Wang, Yangze Li, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Lei Xie, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Long Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T03:49:55Z

**Summary**: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.

### Auto-RAG: Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Tian Yu, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T03:01:05Z

**Summary**: Iterative retrieval refers to the process in which the model continuously queries the retriever during generation to enhance the relevance of the retrieved knowledge, thereby improving the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Existing work typically employs few-shot prompting or manually constructed rules to implement iterative retrieval. This introduces additional inference overhead and overlooks the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Auto-RAG, an autonomous iterative retrieval model centered on the LLM's powerful decision-making capabilities. Auto-RAG engages in multi-turn dialogues with the retriever, systematically planning retrievals and refining queries to acquire valuable knowledge. This process continues until sufficient external information is gathered, at which point the results are presented to the user. To this end, we develop a method for autonomously synthesizing reasoning-based decision-making instructions in iterative retrieval and fine-tuned the latest open-source LLMs. The experimental results indicate that Auto-RAG is capable of autonomous iterative interaction with the retriever, effectively leveraging the remarkable reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs, which lead to outstanding performance across six benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that Auto-RAG can autonomously adjust the number of iterations based on the difficulty of the questions and the utility of the retrieved knowledge, without requiring any human intervention. Moreover, Auto-RAG expresses the iterative retrieval process in natural language, enhancing interpretability while providing users with a more intuitive experience\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ictnlp/Auto-RAG}.

**Authors**: Jie Liu, Wenxuan Wang, Yihang Su, Jingyuan Huan, Wenting Chen, Yudi Zhang, Cheng-Yi Li, Kao-Jung Chang, Xiaohan Xin, Linlin Shen, Michael R. Lyu

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T02:50:45Z

**Summary**: The significant breakthroughs of Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) renovate modern healthcare with robust information synthesis and medical decision support. However, these models are often evaluated on benchmarks that are unsuitable for the Med-MLLMs due to the complexity of real-world diagnostics across diverse specialties. To address this gap, we introduce Asclepius, a novel Med-MLLM benchmark that comprehensively assesses Med-MLLMs in terms of: distinct medical specialties (cardiovascular, gastroenterology, etc.) and different diagnostic capacities (perception, disease analysis, etc.). Grounded in 3 proposed core principles, Asclepius ensures a comprehensive evaluation by encompassing 15 medical specialties, stratifying into 3 main categories and 8 sub-categories of clinical tasks, and exempting overlap with existing VQA dataset. We further provide an in-depth analysis of 6 Med-MLLMs and compare them with 3 human specialists, providing insights into their competencies and limitations in various medical contexts. Our work not only advances the understanding of Med-MLLMs' capabilities but also sets a precedent for future evaluations and the safe deployment of these models in clinical environments.

### RePD: Defending Jailbreak Attack through a Retrieval-based Prompt   Decomposition Process
**Authors**: Peiran Wang, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T02:35:47Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduce RePD, an innovative attack Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition framework designed to mitigate the risk of jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). Despite rigorous pretraining and finetuning focused on ethical alignment, LLMs are still susceptible to jailbreak exploits. RePD operates on a one-shot learning model, wherein it accesses a database of pre-collected jailbreak prompt templates to identify and decompose harmful inquiries embedded within user prompts. This process involves integrating the decomposition of the jailbreak prompt into the user's original query into a one-shot learning example to effectively teach the LLM to discern and separate malicious components. Consequently, the LLM is equipped to first neutralize any potentially harmful elements before addressing the user's prompt in a manner that aligns with its ethical guidelines. RePD is versatile and compatible with a variety of open-source LLMs acting as agents. Through comprehensive experimentation with both harmful and benign prompts, we have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed RePD in enhancing the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks, without compromising their performance in responding to typical user requests.

### Conversational Complexity for Assessing Risk in Large Language Models
**Authors**: John Burden, Manuel Cebrian, Jose Hernandez-Orallo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T01:47:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case in early 2023 involved journalist Kevin Roose's extended dialogue with Bing, an LLM-powered search engine, which revealed harmful outputs after probing questions, highlighting vulnerabilities in the model's safeguards. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks, like the "Grandma Jailbreak," where users framed requests as innocent help for a grandmother, easily eliciting similar content. This raises the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures to quantify this effort: Conversational Length (CL), which measures the number of conversational turns needed to obtain a specific harmful response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the harmful response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of the user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimization of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.

### Core Placement Optimization of Many-core Brain-Inspired Near-Storage   Systems for Spiking Neural Network Training
**Authors**: Xueke Zhu, Wenjie Lin, Yanyu Lin, Wenxiang Cheng, Zhengyu Ma, Yonghong Tian, Huihui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T01:46:30Z

**Summary**: With the increasing application scope of spiking neural networks (SNN), the complexity of SNN models has surged, leading to an exponential growth in demand for AI computility. As the new generation computing architecture of the neural networks, the efficiency and power consumption of distributed storage and parallel computing in the many-core near-memory computing system have attracted much attention. Among them, the mapping problem from logical cores to physical cores is one of the research hotspots. In order to improve the computing parallelism and system throughput of the many-core near-memory computing system, and to reduce power consumption, we propose a SNN training many-core deployment optimization method based on Off-policy Deterministic Actor-Critic. We utilize deep reinforcement learning as a nonlinear optimizer, treating the many-core topology as network graph features and using graph convolution to input the many-core structure into the policy network. We update the parameters of the policy network through near-end policy optimization to achieve deployment optimization of SNN models in the many-core near-memory computing architecture to reduce chip power consumption. To handle large-dimensional action spaces, we use continuous values matching the number of cores as the output of the policy network and then discretize them again to obtain new deployment schemes. Furthermore, to further balance inter-core computation latency and improve system throughput, we propose a model partitioning method with a balanced storage and computation strategy. Our method overcomes the problems such as uneven computation and storage loads between cores, and the formation of local communication hotspots, significantly reducing model training time, communication costs, and average flow load between cores in the many-core near-memory computing architecture.

### Sequential Large Language Model-Based Hyper-Parameter Optimization
**Authors**: Kanan Mahammadli, Seyda Bolelli Ertekin

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T00:27:46Z

**Summary**: This study introduces SLLMBO, an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating dynamic search space adaptability, enhanced parameter landscape exploitation, and a hybrid, novel LLM-Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (LLM-TPE) sampler. By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-flash, extending prior work beyond GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios further demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation.

### Offline Reinforcement Learning and Sequence Modeling for Downlink Link   Adaptation
**Authors**: Samuele Peri, Alessio Russo, Gabor Fodor, Pablo Soldati

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T23:00:31Z

**Summary**: Link adaptation (LA) is an essential function in modern wireless communication systems that dynamically adjusts the transmission rate of a communication link to match time- and frequency-varying radio link conditions. However, factors such as user mobility, fast fading, imperfect channel quality information, and aging of measurements make the modeling of LA challenging. To bypass the need for explicit modeling, recent research has introduced online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches as an alternative to the more commonly used rule-based algorithms. Yet, RL-based approaches face deployment challenges, as training in live networks can potentially degrade real-time performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL as a candidate to learn LA policies with minimal effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformer. Our results show that offline RL algorithms can match the performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.

### User Interaction Patterns and Breakdowns in Conversing with LLM-Powered   Voice Assistants
**Authors**: Amama Mahmood, Junxiang Wang, Bingsheng Yao, Dakuo Wang, Chien-Ming Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T22:32:19Z

**Summary**: Conventional Voice Assistants (VAs) rely on traditional language models to discern user intent and respond to their queries, leading to interactions that often lack a broader contextual understanding, an area in which Large Language Models (LLMs) excel. However, current LLMs are largely designed for text-based interactions, thus making it unclear how user interactions will evolve if their modality is changed to voice. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can enrich VA interactions via an exploratory study with participants (N=20) using a ChatGPT-powered VA for three scenarios (medical self-diagnosis, creative planning, and discussion) with varied constraints, stakes, and objectivity. We observe that LLM-powered VA elicits richer interaction patterns that vary across tasks, showing its versatility. Notably, LLMs absorb the majority of VA intent recognition failures. We additionally discuss the potential of harnessing LLMs for more resilient and fluid user-VA interactions and provide design guidelines for tailoring LLMs for voice assistance.

**Authors**: Antonin Sulc, Thorsten Hellert, Raimund Kammering, Hayden Houscher, Jason St. John

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T22:19:48Z

**Summary**: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components.   This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.

### A Computational Framework for Behavioral Assessment of LLM Therapists
**Authors**: Yu Ying Chiu, Ashish Sharma, Inna Wanyin Lin, Tim Althoff

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T22:01:57Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has increased interest in their use as therapists to address mental health challenges and the widespread lack of access to care. However, experts have emphasized the critical need for systematic evaluation of LLM-based mental health interventions to accurately assess their capabilities and limitations. Here, we propose BOLT, a proof-of-concept computational framework to systematically assess the conversational behavior of LLM therapists. We quantitatively measure LLM behavior across 13 psychotherapeutic approaches with in-context learning methods. Then, we compare the behavior of LLMs against high- and low-quality human therapy. Our analysis based on Motivational Interviewing therapy reveals that LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in low-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher degree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions. However, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs reflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our findings caution that LLM therapists still require further research for consistent, high-quality care.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Ravi Netravali, Yida Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T21:10:20Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

**Authors**: Fomubad Borista Fondi, Azanzi Jiomekong Fidel, Gaoussou Camara

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T20:29:44Z

**Summary**: The Scholarly Hybrid Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) Challenge at the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) 2024 focuses on Question Answering (QA) over diverse scholarly sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex, and Wikipedia-based texts. This paper describes a methodology that combines SPARQL queries, divide and conquer algorithms, and a pre-trained extractive question answering model. It starts with SPARQL queries to gather data, then applies divide and conquer to manage various question types and sources, and uses the model to handle personal author questions. The approach, evaluated with Exact Match and F-score metrics, shows promise for improving QA accuracy and efficiency in scholarly contexts.

### Confidential Prompting: Protecting User Prompts from Cloud LLM Providers
**Authors**: In Gim, Caihua Li, Lin Zhong

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T20:20:23Z

**Summary**: Our work tackles the challenge of securing user inputs in cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) serving while ensuring output invariance, model confidentiality, and compute efficiency. We introduce secure multi-party decoding (SMD), which leverages confidential computing to confine user prompts to a trusted execution environment (TEE), namely a confidential virtual machine (CVM), while allowing service providers to generate tokens efficiently. We also introduce a novel cryptographic method, prompt obfuscation (PO), to ensure robustness against reconstruction attacks on SMD. We demonstrate that our approach preserves both prompt confidentiality and LLM serving efficiency. Our solution can enable privacy-preserving cloud LLM serving that handles sensitive prompts, such as clinical records, financial data, and personal information.

### DENIAHL: In-Context Features Influence LLM Needle-In-A-Haystack   Abilities
**Authors**: Hui Dai, Dan Pechi, Xinyi Yang, Garvit Banga, Raghav Mantri

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T20:14:47Z

**Summary**: The Needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test is a general task used to assess language models' (LMs') abilities to recall particular information from long input context. This framework however does not provide a means of analyzing what factors, beyond context length, contribute to LMs' abilities or inabilities to separate and recall needles from their haystacks. To provide a systematic means of assessing what features contribute to LMs' NIAH capabilities, we developed a synthetic benchmark called DENIAHL (Data-oriented Evaluation of NIAH for LLM's). Our work expands on previous NIAH studies by ablating NIAH features beyond typical context length including data type, size, and patterns. We find stark differences between GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 2-7B's performance on DENIAHL, and drops in recall performance when features like item size are increased, and to some degree when data type is changed from numbers to letters. This has implications for increasingly large context models, demonstrating factors beyond item-number impact NIAH capabilities.

### Gender Bias in LLM-generated Interview Responses
**Authors**: Haein Kong, Yongsu Ahn, Sangyub Lee, Yunho Maeng

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T19:54:09Z

**Summary**: LLMs have emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals in diverse text-generation tasks, including job-related texts. However, LLM-generated answers have been increasingly found to exhibit gender bias. This study evaluates three LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude) to conduct a multifaceted audit of LLM-generated interview responses across models, question types, and jobs, and their alignment with two gender stereotypes. Our findings reveal that gender bias is consistent, and closely aligned with gender stereotypes and the dominance of jobs. Overall, this study contributes to the systematic examination of gender bias in LLM-generated interview responses, highlighting the need for a mindful approach to mitigate such biases in related applications.

### OMuleT: Orchestrating Multiple Tools for Practicable Conversational   Recommendation
**Authors**: Se-eun Yoon, Xiaokai Wei, Yexi Jiang, Rachit Pareek, Frank Ong, Kevin Gao, Julian McAuley, Michelle Gong

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T19:53:39Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present a systematic effort to design, evaluate, and implement a realistic conversational recommender system (CRS). The objective of our system is to allow users to input free-form text to request recommendations, and then receive a list of relevant and diverse items. While previous work on synthetic queries augments large language models (LLMs) with 1-3 tools, we argue that a more extensive toolbox is necessary to effectively handle real user requests. As such, we propose a novel approach that equips LLMs with over 10 tools, providing them access to the internal knowledge base and API calls used in production. We evaluate our model on a dataset of real users and show that it generates relevant, novel, and diverse recommendations compared to vanilla LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the full range of tools in our toolbox. We share our designs and lessons learned from deploying the system for internal alpha release. Our contribution is the addressing of all four key aspects of a practicable CRS: (1) real user requests, (2) augmenting LLMs with a wide variety of tools, (3) extensive evaluation, and (4) deployment insights.

### CLIP meets DINO for Tuning Zero-Shot Classifier using Unlabeled Image   Collections
**Authors**: Mohamed Fazli Imam, Rufael Fedaku Marew, Jameel Hassan, Mustansar Fiaz, Alham Fikri Aji, Hisham Cholakkal

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T19:48:54Z

**Summary**: In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text and visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings and DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual and textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFter across 11 diverse image classification datasets.

### Deliberate Reasoning for LLMs as Structure-aware Planning with Accurate   World Model
**Authors**: Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Yuan Yang, Faramarz Fekri

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T19:47:26Z

**Summary**: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making. Humans excel at these tasks by leveraging deliberate planning with an internal world model to simulate the potential outcomes of various actions. Inspired by this, we propose a novel multi-step reasoning framework for LLMs, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with Accurate World Model (SWAP). Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in natural language, SWAP incorporates structural information to guide the reasoning process via a world model and provides a soft verification mechanism over the steps. Moreover, SWAP overcomes the challenge of accurate world state predictions in complex reasoning tasks by introducing a Generator-Discriminator architecture, which enables more reliable world modeling. Specifically, the generator predicts the next state, and the discriminator ensures alignment with the logical consistency required by the problem context. SWAP also encourages the policy model to explore a broad range of potential actions to prevent premature convergence. By resolving the bottlenecks of generation diversity for both actions and states using diversity-based modeling (DBM) and improving discrimination accuracy through contrastive ranking (CR), SWAP significantly enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP achieves substantial improvements over the baselines and consistently outperforms existing methods.

### Refine Large Language Model Fine-tuning via Instruction Vector
**Authors**: Gangwei Jiang, Zhaoyi Li, Defu Lian, Ying Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T18:26:28Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can cause them to lose their general capabilities. However, the intrinsic mechanisms behind such forgetting remain unexplored. In this paper, we begin by examining this phenomenon by focusing on knowledge understanding and instruction following, with the latter identified as the main contributor to forgetting during fine-tuning. Consequently, we propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, thereby making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting. Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, we suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting. Building on this insight, we develop IV-guided training, which aims to preserve original computation graph, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach, supporting the relationship between IVs and forgetting. Our code will be made available soon.

### Structured Object Language Modeling (SoLM): Native Structured Objects   Generation Conforming to Complex Schemas with Self-Supervised Denoising
**Authors**: Amir Tavanaei, Kee Kiat Koo, Hayreddin Ceker, Shaobai Jiang, Qi Li, Julien Han, Karim Bouyarmane

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T18:16:41Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of generating structured objects that conform to a complex schema, with intricate dependencies between the different components (facets) of the object. The facets of the object (attributes, fields, columns, properties) can be a mix of short, structured, type-constrained facts, or long natural-language descriptions. The object has to be self-consistent between the different facets in the redundant information it carries (relative consistency), while being grounded with respect to world knowledge (absolute consistency). We frame the problem as a Language Modeling problem (Structured Object Language Modeling) and train an LLM to perform the task natively, without requiring instructions or prompt-engineering. We propose a self-supervised denoising method to train the model from an existing dataset of such objects. The input query can be the existing object itself, in which case the model acts as a regenerator, completing, correcting, normalizing the input, or any unstructured blurb to be structured. We show that the self-supervised denoising training provides a strong baseline, and that additional supervised fine-tuning with small amount of human demonstrations leads to further improvement. Experimental results show that the proposed method matches or outperforms prompt-engineered general-purpose state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3, Mixtral-8x7B), while being order-of-magnitude more cost-efficient.

### VeCoGen: Automating Generation of Formally Verified C Code with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Merlijn Sevenhuijsen, Khashayar Etemadi, Mattias Nyberg

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T17:12:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating code, yet they often produce programs with flaws or deviations from intended behavior, limiting their suitability for safety-critical applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces VeCoGen, a novel tool that combines LLMs with formal verification to automate the generation of formally verified C programs. VeCoGen takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL), a natural language specification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a program. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VeCoGen generates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are sure the program is correct. We evaluate VeCoGen on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems, VeCoGen solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining LLMs with formal verification to automate program generation.

### How far can bias go? -- Tracing bias from pretraining data to alignment
**Authors**: Marion Thaler, Abdullatif Köksal, Alina Leidinger, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:20:25Z

**Summary**: As LLMs are increasingly integrated into user-facing applications, addressing biases that perpetuate societal inequalities is crucial. While much work has gone into measuring or mitigating biases in these models, fewer studies have investigated their origins. Therefore, this study examines the correlation between gender-occupation bias in pre-training data and their manifestation in LLMs, focusing on the Dolma dataset and the OLMo model. Using zero-shot prompting and token co-occurrence analyses, we explore how biases in training data influence model outputs. Our findings reveal that biases present in pre-training data are amplified in model outputs. The study also examines the effects of prompt types, hyperparameters, and instruction-tuning on bias expression, finding instruction-tuning partially alleviating representational bias while still maintaining overall stereotypical gender associations, whereas hyperparameters and prompting variation have a lesser effect on bias expression. Our research traces bias throughout the LLM development pipeline and underscores the importance of mitigating bias at the pretraining stage.

### SmartLLMSentry: A Comprehensive LLM Based Smart Contract Vulnerability   Detection Framework
**Authors**: Oualid Zaazaa, Hanan El Bakkali

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:02:01Z

**Summary**: Smart contracts are essential for managing digital assets in blockchain networks, highlighting the need for effective security measures. This paper introduces SmartLLMSentry, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT with in-context training, to advance smart contract vulnerability detection. Traditional rule-based frameworks have limitations in integrating new detection rules efficiently. In contrast, SmartLLMSentry utilizes LLMs to streamline this process. We created a specialized dataset of five randomly selected vulnerabilities for model training and evaluation. Our results show an exact match accuracy of 91.1% with sufficient data, although GPT-4 demonstrated reduced performance compared to GPT-3 in rule generation. This study illustrates that SmartLLMSentry significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of vulnerability detection through LLMdriven rule integration, offering a new approach to improving Blockchain security and addressing previously underexplored vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T15:49:22Z

**Summary**: Navigating dynamic urban environments presents significant challenges for embodied agents, requiring advanced spatial reasoning and adherence to common-sense norms. Despite progress, existing visual navigation methods struggle in map-free or off-street settings, limiting the deployment of autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a scalable, data-driven approach for human-like urban navigation by training agents on thousands of hours of in-the-wild city walking and driving videos sourced from the web. We introduce a simple and scalable data processing pipeline that extracts action supervision from these videos, enabling large-scale imitation learning without costly annotations. Our model learns sophisticated navigation policies to handle diverse challenges and critical scenarios. Experimental results show that training on large-scale, diverse datasets significantly enhances navigation performance, surpassing current methods. This work shows the potential of using abundant online video data to develop robust navigation policies for embodied agents in dynamic urban settings.

### An Extensive Evaluation of Factual Consistency in Large Language Models   for Data-to-Text Generation
**Authors**: Joy Mahapatra, Utpal Garain

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T15:23:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across various Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) tasks. However, generating factually consistent text in DTG remains challenging for LLMs. Despite this, in-depth evaluations of LLM factual consistency for DTG remain missing in the current literature. This paper addresses this gap by providing an extensive evaluation of factual consistency in LLMs for DTG. Our evaluation covers five widely used DTG datasets (E2E, ViGGo, WikiTableText, DART, and WebNLG) and five prominent LLM families (T5, BART, OPT, BLOOM, and Llama 2). To ensure a thorough evaluation of factual consistency, we use four state-of-the-art automatic metrics and include essential human assessments. Our extensive evaluations reveals three key findings regarding factual consistency in LLMs for DTG. First, Llama 2 often excels in generating factually consistent text, although smaller models like T5 and BART can achieve strong factual consistency on larger, lexically less-diverse datasets. Second, the average rate of change (AROC) indicates that increasing model size (number of model trainable parameters) generally enhances factual consistency of LLMs in DTG. Third, we observe that source-reference divergence (i.e., when the reference text diverges semantically from the source) typically reduces the factual consistency of LLMs in DTG.

### A transfer learning framework for weak-to-strong generalization
**Authors**: Seamus Somerstep, Felipe Maia Polo, Moulinath Banerjee, Ya'acov Ritov, Mikhail Yurochkin, Yuekai Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:58:34Z

**Summary**: Modern large language model (LLM) alignment techniques rely on human feedback, but it is unclear whether these techniques fundamentally limit the capabilities of aligned LLMs. In particular, it is unknown if it is possible to align (stronger) LLMs with superhuman capabilities with (weaker) human feedback without degrading their capabilities. This is an instance of the weak-to-strong generalization problem: using feedback from a weaker (less capable) model to train a stronger (more capable) model. We prove that weak-to-strong generalization is possible by eliciting latent knowledge from pre-trained LLMs. In particular, we cast the weak-to-strong generalization problem as a transfer learning problem in which we wish to transfer a latent concept prior from a weak model to a strong pre-trained model. We prove that a naive fine-tuning approach suffers from fundamental limitations, but an alternative refinement-based approach suggested by the problem structure provably overcomes the limitations of fine-tuning. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the refinement approach in multiple LLM alignment tasks.

### Beyond Logit Lens: Contextual Embeddings for Robust Hallucination   Detection & Grounding in VLMs
**Authors**: Anirudh Phukan, Divyansh, Harshit Kumar Morj, Vaishnavi, Apoorv Saxena, Koustava Goswami

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:47:55Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by harnessing the language abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating modality-specific encoders. However, LMMs are plagued by hallucinations that limit their reliability and adoption. While traditional methods to detect and mitigate these hallucinations often involve costly training or rely heavily on external models, recent approaches utilizing internal model features present a promising alternative. In this paper, we critically assess the limitations of the state-of-the-art training-free technique, the logit lens, in handling generalized visual hallucinations. We introduce a refined method that leverages contextual token embeddings from middle layers of LMMs. This approach significantly improves hallucination detection and grounding across diverse categories, including actions and OCR, while also excelling in tasks requiring contextual understanding, such as spatial relations and attribute comparison. Our novel grounding technique yields highly precise bounding boxes, facilitating a transition from Zero-Shot Object Segmentation to Grounded Visual Question Answering. Our contributions pave the way for more reliable and interpretable multimodal models.

### TimeGPT in Load Forecasting: A Large Time Series Model Perspective
**Authors**: Wenlong Liao, Fernando Porte-Agel, Jiannong Fang, Christian Rehtanz, Shouxiang Wang, Dechang Yang, Zhe Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:30:24Z

**Summary**: Machine learning models have made significant progress in load forecasting, but their forecast accuracy is limited in cases where historical load data is scarce. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset.
