**Authors**: Ismet Dagli, James Crea, Soner Seckiner, Yuanchao Xu, Selçuk Köse, Mehmet E. Belviranli

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:58:57Z

**Summary**: Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

**Authors**: Suyi Li, Lingyun Yang, Xiaoxiao Jiang, Hanfeng Lu, Dakai An, Zhipeng Di, Weiyi Lu, Jiawei Chen, Kan Liu, Yinghao Yu, Tao Lan, Guodong Yang, Lin Qu, Liping Zhang, Wei Wang

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.

### Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free   Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern
**Authors**: Hongyin Tang, Di Xiu, Lanrui Wang, Xiurui Geng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:46:06Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

### A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Caching at Network Edge: Classification,   Solutions, and Challenges
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Shazia Riaz, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:43:55Z

**Summary**: Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

### One-Hop Sub-Query Result Caches for Graph Database Systems
**Authors**: Hieu Nguyen, Jun Li, Shahram Ghandeharizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:20:47Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing graph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop navigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with selection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies a unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable vertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its sequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the cache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates the requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the cache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation of read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and write transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either deletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph query processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the cache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write graph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache. Obtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query response times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query re-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An interesting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the indirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference one-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their processing significantly.

### Cross-Self KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language Inference
**Authors**: Xiaohuan Pei, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:47:17Z

**Summary**: KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%. The code is available at https://github.com/TerryPei/CSP

### Neural Two-Level Monte Carlo Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Mikhail Dereviannykh, Dmitrii Klepikov, Johannes Hanika, Carsten Dachsbacher

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:06:23Z

**Summary**: We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Ji Qi, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T18:58:03Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T14:56:56Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs. Our training, inference, and model implementations are open-sourced and can be found through https://huggingface.co/collections/Snowflake/swiftkv-models-674f7d7474eb789e185d31cb.

### KV Shifting Attention Enhances Language Modeling
**Authors**: Mingyu Xu, Wei Cheng, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T12:19:38Z

**Summary**: The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

### A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference   with Partial Contexts
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T06:52:42Z

**Summary**: Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T04:29:49Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### F2: Designing a Key-Value Store for Large Skewed Workloads
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellis, Badrish Chandramouli, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T01:50:27Z

**Summary**: Many real-world workloads present a challenging set of requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns for both reads and writes. We find that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency, sacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance, saturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory resources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs). Unfortunately these designs are not able to handle meet the challenging demands of such larger-than-memory, skewed workloads.   To this end, we present F2, a new key-value store that bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. F2 adopts a tiered, record-oriented architecture inspired by LSM-trees to effectively separate hot from cold records, while incorporating concurrent latch-free mechanisms from CPU-optimized engines to maximize performance on modern NVMe SSDs. To realize this design, we tackle key challenges and introduce several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction and user operations (e.g., RMWs), as well as new components: a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records and a read-cache for serving read-hot data.   Detailed experimental results show that F2 matches or outperforms existing solutions, achieving on average better throughput on memory-constrained environments compared to state-of-the-art systems like RocksDB (11.75x), SplinterDB (4.52x), KVell (10.56x), LeanStore (2.04x), and FASTER (2.38x). F2 also maintains its high performance across varying workload skewness levels and memory budgets, while achieving low disk write amplification.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T18:40:24Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following   Models Need for Efficient Generation
**Authors**: Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T15:48:59Z

**Summary**: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

### Measurement of electron beam induced sample heating in SEM experiments
**Authors**: Christina Koenig, Alice Bastos da Silva Fanta, Joerg R. Jinschek

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T14:47:42Z

**Summary**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.

### ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable   Compression
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T10:58:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

### Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T08:51:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but incur high serving costs due to substantial memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression methods, including quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform treatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache compression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising accuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores keys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on attention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory based on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV compression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to enable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To efficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations including unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on vLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\times$ to $5.0\times$ without accuracy loss and up to $11.0\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing throughput by $1.9\times$ to $2.5\times$, and up to $6.9\times$.

**Authors**: Xijun Li, Yunfan Zhou, Ji Zhang

**Summary**: Nowadays, the Hierarchical Storage System (HSS) is considered as an ideal model to meet the cost-performance demand. The data migration between storing tiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth control is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous research about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of bandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking optimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the system performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control in HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to formalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a learning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \Pascal{}, which learns to control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative way. We implement \Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three strong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical system shows that \Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and greatly improve throughput stability (2X $\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.

**Authors**: Cebajel Tanan, Sameer G. Kulkarni, Tamal Das, Manjesh K. Hanawal

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T04:29:12Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information. In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence. Our tool is available at www.ipanalyzer.in

### cRVR: A Stackelberg Game Approach for Joint Privacy-Aware Video   Requesting and Edge Caching
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Linchang Xiao, Yipeng Zhou, Miao Hu, Di Wu, John C. S. Lui, Quan Z. Sheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T22:48:09Z

**Summary**: As users conveniently stream their favorite online videos, video request records are automatically stored by video content providers, which have a high chance of privacy leakage. Unfortunately, most existing privacy-enhancing approaches are not applicable for protecting user privacy in video requests, because they cannot be easily altered or distorted by users and must be visible for content providers to stream correct videos. To preserve request privacy in online video services, it is possible to request additional videos that are irrelevant to users' interests so that content providers cannot precisely infer users' interest information. However, a naive redundant requesting approach would significantly degrade the performance of edge caches and increase bandwidth overhead. In this paper, we are among the first to propose a Cache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices (UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which can effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal impact on the EC's performance. To tackle the problem, we first develop a Stackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC, and obtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility. For UDs, the utility function is a combination of both video playback utility and privacy protection utility. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Extensive experiments are conducted with real traces to demonstrate that cRVR can effectively protect video request privacy by reducing up to 59.03\% of privacy disclosure compared to baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, the caching performance of EC is only slightly affected.

### GoldFish: Serverless Actors with Short-Term Memory State for the   Edge-Cloud Continuum
**Authors**: Cynthia Marcelino, Jack Shahhoud, Stefan Nastic

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T22:02:42Z

**Summary**: Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services.   To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T21:40:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:12:09Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:36:19Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention concentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance representation across most layers.

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:29:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

### Improving Sequential Recommender Systems with Online and In-store User   Behavior
**Authors**: Luyi Ma, Aashika Padmanabhan, Anjana Ganesh, Shengwei Tang, Jiao Chen, Xiaohan Li, Lalitesh Morishetti, Kaushiki Nag, Malay Patel, Jason Cho, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:20:40Z

**Summary**: Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T20:39:56Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders
**Authors**: Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T18:59:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

### Local and Regional Contributions to Tropospheric Ozone Concentrations
**Authors**: Callum E. Flowerday, Ryan Thalman, Jaron C. Hansen

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T16:10:26Z

**Summary**: The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.

**Summary**: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

### Real-time Transformer-based Open-Vocabulary Detection with Efficient   Fusion Head
**Authors**: Tiancheng Zhao, Peng Liu, Xuan He, Lu Zhang, Kyusong Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:24:20Z

**Summary**: End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

### Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware   Masking
**Authors**: Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:07:51Z

**Summary**: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.

### Memory-Efficient Training for Deep Speaker Embedding Learning in Speaker   Verification
**Authors**: Bei Liu, Yanmin Qian

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:57:46Z

**Summary**: Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.

### JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Zemin Sun, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:30:04Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

### Optimal Power Allocation in Uplink NOMA with Simultaneous Cache-Enabled   D2D Communications
**Authors**: Aditya Powari, Daniel K. C. So

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T21:47:35Z

**Summary**: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.

### Advanced Video Inpainting Using Optical Flow-Guided Efficient Diffusion
**Authors**: Bohai Gu, Hao Luo, Song Guo, Peiran Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T15:45:26Z

**Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

### SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding for Interactive LLM   Inference on Consumer Devices
**Authors**: Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin

**Updated**: 2024-11-30T21:33:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

**Authors**: Thijs Steel, Julien Langou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:21:12Z

**Summary**: We present an efficient algorithm for the application of sequences of planar rotations to a matrix. Applying such sequences efficiently is important in many numerical linear algebra algorithms for eigenvalues. Our algorithm is novel in three main ways. First, we introduce a new kernel that is optimized for register reuse in a novel way. Second, we introduce a blocking and packing scheme that improves the cache efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we thoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to important theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware.

### DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and   Verifiable Credentials
**Authors**: Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Dennis Natusch, Artur Philipp, Axel Küpper, Hans Joachim Einsiedler, Daniela Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix   Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching
**Authors**: Zhen Zheng, Xin Ji, Taosong Fang, Fanghao Zhou, Chuanjie Liu, Gang Peng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:57:37Z

**Summary**: Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.

### Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching
**Authors**: Xiaofan Niu, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:35:22Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

### Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:42:54Z

**Summary**: We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T12:50:05Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T02:01:50Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

**Authors**: Andrii Skliar, Ties van Rozendaal, Romain Lepert, Todor Boinovski, Mart van Baalen, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:59:48Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:09:29Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines
**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### FastSwitch: Optimizing Context Switching Efficiency in Fairness-aware   Large Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Ao Shen, Zhiyao Li, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T15:07:28Z

**Summary**: Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

### Accelerating Vision Diffusion Transformers with Skip Branches
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T14:43:46Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.git.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T08:21:47Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### A Method for Building Large Language Models with Predefined KV Cache   Capacity
**Authors**: Zhonghua Yi, Ge Niu, Lei Wang, Wei Tang, Liqiu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T03:07:20Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

### Attamba: Attending To Multi-Token States
**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Safeen Huda, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:52:06Z

**Summary**: When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

### STAR: Synthesis of Tailored Architectures
**Authors**: Armin W. Thomas, Rom Parnichkun, Alexander Amini, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:42:42Z

**Summary**: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T17:28:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

**Summary**: This paper studies cache-aided wireless networks in the presence of active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided wireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement, delivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable scheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side information), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the network's parameters. We derive the achievable one-shot sum-DoF for different sizes of cache memories, network configurations, and numbers of IRS elements. Our results highlight the potential of deploying an IRS in cache-aided wireless communication systems, underscoring the enhancement of achievable DoF for various parameter regimes, particularly when the sizes of the caches (especially at the transmitters) are inadequate. Notably, we show that access to an IRS with a sufficient number of elements enables the achievement of the maximum possible DoF for various parameter regimes of interest.

**Authors**: Emanuele Aiello, Umberto Michieli, Diego Valsesia, Mete Ozay, Enrico Magli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T15:03:14Z

**Summary**: Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T05:10:04Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy.

### Efficient LLM Inference with I/O-Aware Partial KV Cache Recomputation
**Authors**: Chaoyi Jiang, Lei Gao, Hossein Entezari Zarch, Murali Annavaram

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T04:03:14Z

**Summary**: Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### Ca2-VDM: Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion Model with Causal   Generation and Cache Sharing
**Authors**: Kaifeng Gao, Jiaxin Shi, Hanwang Zhang, Chunping Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T13:33:41Z

**Summary**: With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T12:14:33Z

**Summary**: Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.   We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

### Deegen: A JIT-Capable VM Generator for Dynamic Languages
**Authors**: Haoran Xu, Fredrik Kjolstad

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T21:57:29Z

**Summary**: Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

### Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM   Inference Environments
**Authors**: Nikoleta Iliakopoulou, Jovan Stojkovic, Chloe Alverti, Tianyin Xu, Hubertus Franke, Josep Torrellas

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T16:20:57Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Baoshun Tong, Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T06:43:38Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) has attracted increasing attention for tackling the issue of distribution shift during the test phase. While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time. Code will be available at https://github.com/BaoshunWq/clip-TAEA.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T22:11:42Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

### TASER: Temporal Adaptive Sampling for Fast and Accurate Dynamic Graph   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Gangda Deng, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng, Yinglong Xia, Christopher Leung, Jianbo Li, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T10:42:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

### HRSAM: Efficient Interactive Segmentation in High-Resolution Images
**Authors**: You Huang, Wenbin Lai, Jiayi Ji, Liujuan Cao, Shengchuan Zhang, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T01:44:00Z

**Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.

### Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation of Liver Domes in kV Triggered   Images for Online Breath-hold Reproducibility Verification of Liver   Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
**Authors**: Sugandima Weragoda, Ping Xia, Kevin Stephans, Neil Woody, Michael Martens, Robert Brown, Bingqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T19:30:40Z

**Summary**: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.

### AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out   Context Attribution
**Authors**: Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Colin Raffel

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T18:06:14Z

**Summary**: The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T15:55:19Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for   Scalable Recommendation System
**Authors**: Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:55:43Z

**Summary**: The model size growth of personalized recommendation systems poses new challenges for inference. Weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed for size reduction, but they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) enhanced the model throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but such algorithms introduce massive CPU-PIM communication into prior PIM systems. We propose ProactivePIM, a PIM system for weight-sharing recommendation system acceleration. ProactivePIM integrates a cache within the PIM with a prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate communication overhead through a subtable mapping strategy. ProactivePIM achieves a 4.8x speedup compared to prior works.

### Static Reuse Profile Estimation for Array Applications
**Authors**: Abdur Razzak, Atanu Barai, Nandakishore Santhi, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:26:57Z

**Summary**: Reuse distance analysis is a widely recognized method for application characterization that illustrates cache locality. Although there are various techniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is both time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory traces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a promisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without running the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static analysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an input program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the execution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory accesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a recursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a separate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a temporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller profiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We use this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our model can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to the dynamic reuse profile methods.

### Retrieval-Enhanced Visual Prompt Learning for Few-shot Classification
**Authors**: Jintao Rong, Hao Chen, Linlin Ou, Tianxiao Chen, Xinyi Yu, Yifan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T04:12:53Z

**Summary**: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has been widely used in various downstream vision tasks. The few-shot learning paradigm has been widely adopted to augment its capacity for these tasks. However, current paradigms may struggle with fine-grained classification, such as satellite image recognition, due to widening domain gaps. To address this limitation, we propose retrieval-enhanced visual prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache and reuse the knowledge of downstream tasks. RePrompt constructs a retrieval database from either training examples or external data if available, and uses a retrieval mechanism to enhance multiple stages of a simple prompt learning baseline, thus narrowing the domain gap. During inference, our enhanced model can reference similar samples brought by retrieval to make more accurate predictions. A detailed analysis reveals that retrieval helps to improve the distribution of late features, thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks. Reprompt attains state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision datasets, including 11 image datasets, 3 video datasets, 1 multi-view dataset, and 4 domain generalization benchmarks.

### InstCache: A Predictive Cache for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Longwei Zou, Tingfeng Liu, Kai Chen, Jiangang Kong, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:52:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life. However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.

### WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Aobo Liang, Yan Sun, Nadra Guizani

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:34:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.

### Adaptable Embeddings Network (AEN)
**Authors**: Stan Loosmore, Alexander Titus

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T02:15:52Z

**Summary**: Modern day Language Models see extensive use in text classification, yet this comes at significant computational cost. Compute-effective classification models are needed for low-resource environments, most notably on edge devices. We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:51:25Z

**Summary**: We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.

### MAS-Attention: Memory-Aware Stream Processing for Attention Acceleration   on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mohammadali Shakerdargah, Shan Lu, Chao Gao, Di Niu

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:44:26Z

**Summary**: The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.

### A Distributed-memory Tridiagonal Solver Based on a Specialised Data   Structure Optimised for CPU and GPU Architectures
**Authors**: Semih Akkurt, Sébastien Lemaire, Paul Bartholomew, Sylvain Laizet

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T18:31:39Z

**Summary**: Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.

**Authors**: Marco Barbisan, Marco Boldrin, Luca Cinnirella, Bruno Laterza, Alberto Maistrello, Lionello Marrelli, Federico Molon, Simone Peruzzo, Cesare Taliercio, Marco Valisa, Enrico Zampiva

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T14:52:36Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T02:04:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T18:24:03Z

**Summary**: In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration.

### An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor   decompositions for Bayesian inversion
**Authors**: Vitalii Aksenov, Martin Eigel

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T11:40:56Z

**Summary**: The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

### Adaptive Cache Management for Complex Storage Systems Using   CNN-LSTM-Based Spatiotemporal Prediction
**Authors**: Xiaoye Wang, Xuan Li, Linji Wang, Tingyi Ruan, Pochun Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T01:55:26Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

### Bi-Mamba: Towards Accurate 1-Bit State Space Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Liqun Ma, Haonan Li, Mingjie Sun, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T18:59:15Z

**Summary**: The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T17:08:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

### Accelerating spherical K-means clustering for large-scale sparse   document data
**Authors**: Kazuo Aoyama, Kazumi Saito

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T05:50:58Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

### Unveiling Redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs): A Systematic   Study
**Authors**: Xibo Sun, Jiarui Fang, Aoyu Li, Jinzhe Pan

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:49:23Z

**Summary**: The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/xdit-project/DiTCacheAnalysis.

### LSMGraph: A High-Performance Dynamic Graph Storage System with   Multi-Level CSR
**Authors**: Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Qian Tao, Sijie Shen, Yanfeng Zhang, Wenyuan Yu, Pengxi Liu, Zhixin Zhang, Hongfu Li, Xiaojian Luo, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:10:28Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

### KV-Tandem -- a Modular Approach to Building High-Speed LSM Storage   Engines
**Authors**: Edward Bortnikov, Michael Azran, Asa Bornstein, Shmuel Dashevsky, Dennis Huang, Omer Kepten, Michael Pan, Gali Sheffi, Moshe Twitto, Tamar Weiss Orzech, Idit Keidar, Guy Gueta, Roey Maor, Niv Dayan

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T14:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present~\emph{KV-Tandem}, a modular architecture for building LSM-based storage engines on top of simple, non-ordered persistent key-value stores (KVSs). KV-Tandem enables advanced functionalities such as range queries and snapshot reads, while maintaining the native KVS performance for random reads and writes. Its modular design offers better performance trade-offs compared to previous KV-separation solutions, which struggle to decompose the monolithic LSM structure. Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T12:56:16Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### I Know What You Sync: Covert and Side Channel Attacks on File Systems   via syncfs
**Authors**: Cheng Gu, Yicheng Zhang, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T20:40:08Z

**Summary**: Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

### Efficient Encoder-Decoder Transformer Decoding for Decomposable Tasks
**Authors**: Bo-Ru Lu, Nikita Haduong, Chien-Yu Lin, Hao Cheng, Noah A. Smith, Mari Ostendorf

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T20:39:46Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.

### Multi-Stage Vision Token Dropping: Towards Efficient Multimodal Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Ting Liu, Liangtao Shi, Richang Hong, Yue Hu, Quanjun Yin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T13:45:33Z

**Summary**: The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/liuting20/MustDrop}.

### Learning-to-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Layer Caching

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T01:39:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### Can Increasing the Hit Ratio Hurt Cache Throughput? (Long Version)
**Authors**: Ziyue Qiu, Juncheng Yang, Mor Harchol-Balter

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T22:37:48Z

**Summary**: Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

 ### Sparse autoencoders reveal selective remapping of visual concepts during   adaptation
**Authors**: Hyesu Lim, Jinho Choi, Jaegul Choo, Steffen Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:59:51Z

**Summary**: Adapting foundation models for specific purposes has become a standard approach to build machine learning systems for downstream applications. Yet, it is an open question which mechanisms take place during adaptation. Here we develop a new Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) for the CLIP vision transformer, named PatchSAE, to extract interpretable concepts at granular levels (e.g. shape, color, or semantics of an object) and their patch-wise spatial attributions. We explore how these concepts influence the model output in downstream image classification tasks and investigate how recent state-of-the-art prompt-based adaptation techniques change the association of model inputs to these concepts. While activations of concepts slightly change between adapted and non-adapted models, we find that the majority of gains on common adaptation tasks can be explained with the existing concepts already present in the non-adapted foundation model. This work provides a concrete framework to train and use SAEs for Vision Transformers and provides insights into explaining adaptation mechanisms.

### APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance
**Authors**: Hanqing Zhu, Zhenyu Zhang, Wenyan Cong, Xi Liu, Sem Park, Vikas Chandra, Bo Long, David Z. Pan, Zhangyang Wang, Jinwon Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:55:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.

### Uncertainty Quantification for Transformer Models for Dark-Pattern   Detection
**Authors**: Javier Muñoz, Álvaro Huertas-García, Carlos Martí-González, Enrique De Miguel Ambite

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:31:51Z

**Summary**: The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces, requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty: Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and trustworthiness are critical.

### On the Generalization of Preference Learning with DPO
**Authors**: Shawn Im, Yixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:31:30Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking. This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses on overparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent of the training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound the generalization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, under specific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferred responses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theoretical findings.

**Authors**: Saransh Kumar Gupta, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Geeta Trilok-Kumar, Ramesh Jain

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:27:15Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG.in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.

### CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite   Captions
**Authors**: Xiaohui Chen, Satya Narayan Shukla, Mahmoud Azab, Aashu Singh, Qifan Wang, David Yang, ShengYun Peng, Hanchao Yu, Shen Yan, Xuewen Zhang, Baosheng He

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:22:47Z

**Summary**: How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.

### Automated, Unsupervised, and Auto-parameterized Inference of Data   Patterns and Anomaly Detection
**Authors**: Qiaolin Qin, Heng Li, Ettore Merlo, Maxime Lamothe

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:18:26Z

**Summary**: With the advent of data-centric and machine learning (ML) systems, data quality is playing an increasingly critical role in ensuring the overall quality of software systems. Data preparation, an essential step towards high data quality, is known to be a highly effort-intensive process. Although prior studies have dealt with one of the most impacting issues, data pattern violations, these studies usually require data-specific configurations (i.e., parameterized) or use carefully curated data as learning examples (i.e., supervised), relying on domain knowledge and deep understanding of the data, or demanding significant manual effort. In this paper, we introduce RIOLU: Regex Inferencer auto-parameterized Learning with Uncleaned data. RIOLU is fully automated, automatically parameterized, and does not need labeled samples. RIOLU can generate precise patterns from datasets in various domains, with a high F1 score of 97.2%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline. In addition, according to our experiment on five datasets with anomalies, RIOLU can automatically estimate a data column's error rate, draw normal patterns, and predict anomalies from unlabeled data with higher performance (up to 800.4% improvement in terms of F1) than the state-of-the-art baseline, even outperforming ChatGPT in terms of both accuracy (12.3% higher F1) and efficiency (10% less inference time). A variant of RIOLU, with user guidance, can further boost its precision, with up to 37.4% improvement in terms of F1. Our evaluation in an industrial setting further demonstrates the practical benefits of RIOLU.

### LIAR: Leveraging Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds
**Authors**: James Beetham, Souradip Chakraborty, Mengdi Wang, Furong Huang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mubarak Shah

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:02:59Z

**Summary**: Many existing jailbreak techniques rely on solving discrete combinatorial optimization, while more recent approaches involve training LLMs to generate multiple adversarial prompts. However, both approaches require significant computational resources to produce even a single adversarial prompt. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of current approaches stems from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem. To address this gap, we formulate the jailbreak problem in terms of alignment. By starting from an available safety-aligned model, we leverage an unsafe reward to guide the safe model towards generating unsafe outputs using alignment techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), effectively performing jailbreaking via alignment. We propose a novel jailbreak method called LIAR (LeveragIng Alignment to jailbReak). To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, we employ a best-of-N method to solve the alignment problem. LIAR offers significant advantages: lower computational requirements without additional training, fully black-box operation, competitive attack success rates, and more human-readable prompts. We provide theoretical insights into the possibility of jailbreaking a safety-aligned model, revealing inherent vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies for LLMs. We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed \algo. Experimentally, we achieve ASR comparable to the SoTA with a 10x improvement to perplexity and a Time-to-Attack measured in seconds rather than tens of hours.

### BEExformer: A Fast Inferencing Transformer Architecture via Binarization   with Multiple Early Exits
**Authors**: Wazib Ansar, Saptarsi Goswami, Amlan Chakrabarti

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:58:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the GLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.

### 100% Hallucination Elimination Using Acurai
**Authors**: Michael C. Wood, Adam A. Forbes

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:54:54Z

**Summary**: The issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in enterprise and other high-stakes applications. Despite advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve more than 80% accuracy in generating faithful and factually correct outputs, even when provided with relevant and accurate context. In this work, we introduce Acurai, a novel systematic approach that achieves 100% hallucination-free responses in LLMs by reformatting queries and context data prior to input. Leveraging a deep understanding of LLM internal representations, the importance of noun-phrase dominance, and the role of discrete functional units (DFUs), Acurai ensures alignment between input context and generated output. We validate this method using the RAGTruth corpus, demonstrating its ability to eliminate 100% hallucinations for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Acurai sets a new standard for achieving consistent, accurate, and faithful AI responses, marking a significant step forward in the development of trustworthy AI systems.

### Probing neutrino mass ordering with supernova neutrinos at NO$ν$A   including the effect of sterile neutrinos
**Authors**: Papia Panda, Rukmani Mohanta

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:43:51Z

**Summary**: In this work, we explore the possibility of probing the mass ordering sensitivity as a function of supernova distance in the context of the ongoing neutrino experiment NO$\nu$A. We provide a detailed study of the active-active and active-sterile mixing frameworks, illustrating how supernova neutrinos can be used to realize the existence of sterile neutrinos. Interestingly, we infer that observation of the NC channel alone can differentiate between the presence and absence of sterile neutrinos. Our study reveals that in the presence of sterile neutrinos, the mass hierarchy sensitivity is significantly reduced compared to the active-active framework for the NC channel. Our results indicate that the primary channel of NO$\nu$A can distinguish normal mass hierarchy from inverted mass hierarchy at $5 \sigma$ confidence level for a supernova explosion occurring at a distance of 5 kpc. Additionally, we examine the impact of systematic uncertainties on mass hierarchy sensitivity, showing that higher levels of systematics lead to a reduction in sensitivity. Similarly, the inclusion of energy smearing significantly diminishes hierarchy sensitivity.

### Evaluating and Aligning CodeLLMs on Human Preference
**Authors**: Jian Yang, Jiaxi Yang, Ke Jin, Yibo Miao, Lei Zhang, Liqun Yang, Zeyu Cui, Yichang Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:40:38Z

**Summary**: Code large language models (codeLLMs) have made significant strides in code generation. Most previous code-related benchmarks, which consist of various programming exercises along with the corresponding test cases, are used as a common measure to evaluate the performance and capabilities of code LLMs. However, the current code LLMs focus on synthesizing the correct code snippet, ignoring the alignment with human preferences, where the query should be sampled from the practical application scenarios and the model-generated responses should satisfy the human preference. To bridge the gap between the model-generated response and human preference, we present a rigorous human-curated benchmark CodeArena to emulate the complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, where 397 high-quality samples spanning 40 categories and 44 programming languages, carefully curated from user queries. Further, we propose a diverse synthetic instruction corpus SynCode-Instruct (nearly 20B tokens) by scaling instructions from the website to verify the effectiveness of the large-scale synthetic instruction fine-tuning, where Qwen2.5-SynCoder totally trained on synthetic instruction data can achieve top-tier performance of open-source code LLMs. The results find performance differences between execution-based benchmarks and CodeArena. Our systematic experiments of CodeArena on 40+ LLMs reveal a notable performance gap between open SOTA code LLMs (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1), underscoring the importance of the human preference alignment.\footnote{\url{https://codearenaeval.github.io/ }}

**Authors**: Aditi Singh, Akash Shetty, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:36:28Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL systems facilitate smooth interaction with databases by translating natural language queries into Structured Query Language (SQL), bridging the gap between non-technical users and complex database management systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI-driven text-to-SQL systems, highlighting their foundational components, advancements in large language model (LLM) architectures, and the critical role of datasets such as Spider, WikiSQL, and CoSQL in driving progress. We examine the applications of text-to-SQL in domains like healthcare, education, and finance, emphasizing their transformative potential for improving data accessibility. Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL databases and dynamic real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline future research directions, such as extending text-to-SQL capabilities to support NoSQL databases, designing datasets for dynamic multi-turn interactions, and optimizing systems for real-world scalability and robustness. By surveying current advancements and identifying key gaps, this paper aims to guide the next generation of research and applications in LLM-based text-to-SQL systems.

### ConQRet: Benchmarking Fine-Grained Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented   Argumentation with LLM Judges
**Authors**: Kaustubh D. Dhole, Kai Shu, Eugene Agichtein

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:35:52Z

**Summary**: Computational argumentation, which involves generating answers or summaries for controversial topics like abortion bans and vaccination, has become increasingly important in today's polarized environment. Sophisticated LLM capabilities offer the potential to provide nuanced, evidence-based answers to such questions through Retrieval-Augmented Argumentation (RAArg), leveraging real-world evidence for high-quality, grounded arguments. However, evaluating RAArg remains challenging, as human evaluation is costly and difficult for complex, lengthy answers on complicated topics. At the same time, re-using existing argumentation datasets is no longer sufficient, as they lack long, complex arguments and realistic evidence from potentially misleading sources, limiting holistic evaluation of retrieval effectiveness and argument quality. To address these gaps, we investigate automated evaluation methods using multiple fine-grained LLM judges, providing better and more interpretable assessments than traditional single-score metrics and even previously reported human crowdsourcing. To validate the proposed techniques, we introduce ConQRet, a new benchmark featuring long and complex human-authored arguments on debated topics, grounded in real-world websites, allowing an exhaustive evaluation across retrieval effectiveness, argument quality, and groundedness. We validate our LLM Judges on a prior dataset and the new ConQRet benchmark. Our proposed LLM Judges and the ConQRet benchmark can enable rapid progress in computational argumentation and can be naturally extended to other complex retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

### Are Frontier Large Language Models Suitable for Q&A in Science Centres?
**Authors**: Jacob Watson, Fabrício Góes, Marco Volpe, Talles Medeiros

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:28:43Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the suitability of frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) for Q&A interactions in science centres, with the aim of boosting visitor engagement while maintaining factual accuracy. Using a dataset of questions collected from the National Space Centre in Leicester (UK), we evaluated responses generated by three leading models: OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini 1.5. Each model was prompted for both standard and creative responses tailored to an 8-year-old audience, and these responses were assessed by space science experts based on accuracy, engagement, clarity, novelty, and deviation from expected answers. The results revealed a trade-off between creativity and accuracy, with Claude outperforming GPT and Gemini in both maintaining clarity and engaging young audiences, even when asked to generate more creative responses. Nonetheless, experts observed that higher novelty was generally associated with reduced factual reliability across all models. This study highlights the potential of LLMs in educational settings, emphasizing the need for careful prompt engineering to balance engagement with scientific rigor.

### Is Your Paper Being Reviewed by an LLM? Investigating AI Text   Detectability in Peer Review
**Authors**: Sungduk Yu, Man Luo, Avinash Madasu, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:23:53Z

**Summary**: Peer review is a critical process for ensuring the integrity of published scientific research. Confidence in this process is predicated on the assumption that experts in the relevant domain give careful consideration to the merits of manuscripts which are submitted for publication. With the recent rapid advancements in the linguistic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a new potential risk to the peer review process is that negligent reviewers will rely on LLMs to perform the often time consuming process of reviewing a paper. In this study, we investigate the ability of existing AI text detection algorithms to distinguish between peer reviews written by humans and different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that existing approaches fail to identify many GPT-4o written reviews without also producing a high number of false positive classifications. To address this deficiency, we propose a new detection approach which surpasses existing methods in the identification of GPT-4o written peer reviews at low levels of false positive classifications. Our work reveals the difficulty of accurately identifying AI-generated text at the individual review level, highlighting the urgent need for new tools and methods to detect this type of unethical application of generative AI.

### Piecewise-linear modeling of multivariate geometric extremes
**Authors**: Ryan Campbell, Jennifer Wadsworth

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:18:31Z

**Summary**: A recent development in extreme value modeling uses the geometry of the dataset to perform inference on the multivariate tail. A key quantity in this inference is the gauge function, whose values define this geometry. Methodology proposed to date for capturing the gauge function either lacks flexibility due to parametric specifications, or relies on complex neural network specifications in dimensions greater than three. We propose a semiparametric gauge function that is piecewise-linear, making it simple to interpret and provides a good approximation for the true underlying gauge function. This linearity also makes optimization tasks computationally inexpensive. The piecewise-linear gauge function can be used to define both a radial and an angular model, allowing for the joint fitting of extremal pseudo-polar coordinates, a key aspect of this geometric framework. We further expand the toolkit for geometric extremal modeling through the estimation of high radial quantiles at given angular values via kernel density estimation. We apply the new methodology to air pollution data, which exhibits a complex extremal dependence structure.

**Authors**: Jinlin Wu, Xusheng Liang, Xuexue Bai, Zhen Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:07:27Z

**Summary**: Surgical interventions, particularly in neurology, represent complex and high-stakes scenarios that impose substantial cognitive burdens on surgical teams. Although deliberate education and practice can enhance cognitive capabilities, surgical training opportunities remain limited due to patient safety concerns. To address these cognitive challenges in surgical training and operation, we propose SurgBox, an agent-driven sandbox framework to systematically enhance the cognitive capabilities of surgeons in immersive surgical simulations. Specifically, our SurgBox leverages large language models (LLMs) with tailored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to authentically replicate various surgical roles, enabling realistic training environments for deliberate practice. In particular, we devise Surgery Copilot, an AI-driven assistant to actively coordinate the surgical information stream and support clinical decision-making, thereby diminishing the cognitive workload of surgical teams during surgery. By incorporating a novel Long-Short Memory mechanism, our Surgery Copilot can effectively balance immediate procedural assistance with comprehensive surgical knowledge. Extensive experiments using real neurosurgical procedure records validate our SurgBox framework in both enhancing surgical cognitive capabilities and supporting clinical decision-making. By providing an integrated solution for training and operational support to address cognitive challenges, our SurgBox framework advances surgical education and practice, potentially transforming surgical outcomes and healthcare quality. The code is available at https://github.com/franciszchen/SurgBox.

### LinVT: Empower Your Image-level Large Language Model to Understand   Videos
**Authors**: Lishuai Gao, Yujie Zhong, Yingsen Zeng, Haoxian Tan, Dengjie Li, Zheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:04:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in various tasks, motivating us to develop an LLM-based assistant for videos. Instead of training from scratch, we propose a module to transform arbitrary well-trained image-based LLMs into video-LLMs (after being trained on video data). To better adapt image-LLMs for processing videos, we introduce two design principles: linear transformation to preserve the original visual-language alignment and representative information condensation from redundant video content. Guided by these principles, we propose a plug-and-play Linear Video Tokenizer(LinVT), which enables existing image-LLMs to understand videos. We benchmark LinVT with six recent visual LLMs: Aquila, Blip-3, InternVL2, Mipha, Molmo and Qwen2-VL, showcasing the high compatibility of LinVT. LinVT-based LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, illustrating the effectiveness of LinVT in multi-modal video understanding.

**Authors**: Junhao Chen, Peng Shu, Yiwei Li, Huaqin Zhao, Hanqi Jiang, Yi Pan, Yifan Zhou, Zhengliang Liu, Lewis C Howe, Tianming Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:04:21Z

**Summary**: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for working with natural language, bringing advances in many areas of computational linguistics. However, these models face challenges when applied to low-resource languages due to limited training data and difficulty in understanding cultural nuances. In this paper, we propose QueEn, a novel approach for Quechua-English translation that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Our method leverages external linguistic resources through RAG and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient model adaptation. Experimental results show that our approach substantially exceeds baseline models, with a BLEU score of 17.6 compared to 1.5 for standard GPT models. The integration of RAG with fine-tuning allows our system to address the challenges of low-resource language translation while maintaining computational efficiency. This work contributes to the broader goal of preserving endangered languages through advanced language technologies.

### Privacy Drift: Evolving Privacy Concerns in Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Sayyed Farid Ahamed, Soumya Banerjee, Sandip Roy, Aayush Kapoor, Marc Vucovich, Kevin Choi, Abdul Rahman, Edward Bowen, Sachin Shetty

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:04:09Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML), Federated Learning (FL) presents a paradigm shift towards decentralized model training while preserving user data privacy. This paper introduces the concept of ``privacy drift", an innovative framework that parallels the well-known phenomenon of concept drift. While concept drift addresses the variability in model accuracy over time due to changes in the data, privacy drift encapsulates the variation in the leakage of private information as models undergo incremental training. By defining and examining privacy drift, this study aims to unveil the nuanced relationship between the evolution of model performance and the integrity of data privacy. Through rigorous experimentation, we investigate the dynamics of privacy drift in FL systems, focusing on how model updates and data distribution shifts influence the susceptibility of models to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks (MIA). Our results highlight a complex interplay between model accuracy and privacy safeguards, revealing that enhancements in model performance can lead to increased privacy risks. We provide empirical evidence from experiments on customized datasets derived from CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 100 classes), showcasing the impact of data and concept drift on privacy. This work lays the groundwork for future research on privacy-aware machine learning, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between model accuracy and data privacy in decentralized environments.

**Summary**: Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily life for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower individuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo.

### WAPITI: A Watermark for Finetuned Open-Source LLMs
**Authors**: Lingjie Chen, Ruizhong Qiu, Siyu Yuan, Zhining Liu, Tianxin Wei, Hyunsik Yoo, Zhichen Zeng, Deqing Yang, Hanghang Tong

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:50:13Z

**Summary**: Watermarking of large language models (LLMs) generation embeds an imperceptible statistical pattern within texts, making it algorithmically detectable. Watermarking is a promising method for addressing potential harm and biases from LLMs, as it enables traceability, accountability, and detection of manipulated content, helping to mitigate unintended consequences. However, for open-source models, watermarking faces two major challenges: (i) incompatibility with fine-tuned models, and (ii) vulnerability to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we propose WAPITI, a new method that transfers watermarking from base models to fine-tuned models through parameter integration. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first watermark for fine-tuned open-source LLMs that preserves their fine-tuned capabilities. Furthermore, our approach offers an effective defense against fine-tuning attacks. We test our method on various model architectures and watermarking strategies. Results demonstrate that our method can successfully inject watermarks and is highly compatible with fine-tuned models. Additionally, we offer an in-depth analysis of how parameter editing influences the watermark strength and overall capabilities of the resulting models.

### Connecting Large Language Models with Blockchain: Advancing the   Evolution of Smart Contracts from Automation to Intelligence
**Authors**: Youquan Xian, Xueying Zeng, Duancheng Xuan, Danping Yang, Chunpei Li, Peng Fan, Peng Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:43:58Z

**Summary**: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.

### A Differentially Private Kaplan-Meier Estimator for Privacy-Preserving   Survival Analysis
**Authors**: Narasimha Raghavan Veeraragavan, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Jan Franz Nygård

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:29:53Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a differentially private approach to Kaplan-Meier estimation that achieves accurate survival probability estimates while safeguarding individual privacy. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is widely used in survival analysis to estimate survival functions over time, yet applying it to sensitive datasets, such as clinical records, risks revealing private information. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm that applies time-indexed Laplace noise, dynamic clipping, and smoothing to produce a privacy-preserving survival curve while maintaining the cumulative structure of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. By scaling noise over time, the algorithm accounts for decreasing sensitivity as fewer individuals remain at risk, while dynamic clipping and smoothing prevent extreme values and reduce fluctuations, preserving the natural shape of the survival curve.   Our results, evaluated on the NCCTG lung cancer dataset, show that the proposed method effectively lowers root mean squared error (RMSE) and enhances accuracy across privacy budgets ($\epsilon$). At $\epsilon = 10$, the algorithm achieves an RMSE as low as 0.04, closely approximating non-private estimates. Additionally, membership inference attacks reveal that higher $\epsilon$ values (e.g., $\epsilon \geq 6$) significantly reduce influential points, particularly at higher thresholds, lowering susceptibility to inference attacks. These findings confirm that our approach balances privacy and utility, advancing privacy-preserving survival analysis.

### Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues
**Authors**: Riccardo Grazzi, Julien Siems, Jörg K. H. Franke, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:22:21Z

**Summary**: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers in large language modeling, offering linear scaling with sequence length and improved training efficiency. However, LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation or tracking a chess game. Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like LSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs, which have recently shown promise in models such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our empirical results confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with an extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable performance and stability while showing promise on code and math data. Our work enhances the expressivity of modern LRNNs, broadening their applicability without changing the cost of training or inference.

### A text-to-tabular approach to generate synthetic patient data using LLMs
**Authors**: Margaux Tornqvist, Jean-Daniel Zucker, Tristan Fauvel, Nicolas Lambert, Mathilde Berthelot, Antoine Movschin

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:10:40Z

**Summary**: Access to large-scale high-quality healthcare databases is key to accelerate medical research and make insightful discoveries about diseases. However, access to such data is often limited by patient privacy concerns, data sharing restrictions and high costs. To overcome these limitations, synthetic patient data has emerged as an alternative. However, synthetic data generation (SDG) methods typically rely on machine learning (ML) models trained on original data, leading back to the data scarcity problem. We propose an approach to generate synthetic tabular patient data that does not require access to the original data, but only a description of the desired database. We leverage prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic patient data, even in a low-resource setting. We quantitatively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art SDG models, using fidelity, privacy, and utility metrics. Our results show that while LLMs may not match the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on the original data, they effectively generate realistic patient data with well-preserved clinical correlations. An ablation study highlights key elements of our prompt contributing to high-quality synthetic patient data generation. This approach, which is easy to use and does not require original data or advanced ML skills, is particularly valuable for quickly generating custom-designed patient data, supporting project implementation and providing educational resources.

### Explingo: Explaining AI Predictions using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Alexandra Zytek, Sara Pido, Sarah Alnegheimish, Laure Berti-Equille, Kalyan Veeramachaneni

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:01:30Z

**Summary**: Explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions generated by Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP are essential for people using ML outputs for decision-making. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform these explanations into human-readable, narrative formats that align with natural communication. We address two key research questions: (1) Can LLMs reliably transform traditional explanations into high-quality narratives? and (2) How can we effectively evaluate the quality of narrative explanations? To answer these questions, we introduce Explingo, which consists of two LLM-based subsystems, a Narrator and Grader. The Narrator takes in ML explanations and transforms them into natural-language descriptions. The Grader scores these narratives on a set of metrics including accuracy, completeness, fluency, and conciseness.   Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate high-quality narratives that achieve high scores across all metrics, particularly when guided by a small number of human-labeled and bootstrapped examples. We also identified areas that remain challenging, in particular for effectively scoring narratives in complex domains. The findings from this work have been integrated into an open-source tool that makes narrative explanations available for further applications.

### Can Large Language Models Serve as Effective Classifiers for   Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Documents at Industrial   Scale?
**Authors**: Seyed Amin Tabatabaei, Sarah Fancher, Michael Parsons, Arian Askari

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:51:22Z

**Summary**: We address the task of hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) of scientific documents at an industrial scale, where hundreds of thousands of documents must be classified across thousands of dynamic labels. The rapid growth of scientific publications necessitates scalable and efficient methods for classification, further complicated by the evolving nature of taxonomies--where new categories are introduced, existing ones are merged, and outdated ones are deprecated. Traditional machine learning approaches, which require costly retraining with each taxonomy update, become impractical due to the high overhead of labelled data collection and model adaptation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex tasks such as multi-label classification. However, applying them to large and dynamic taxonomies presents unique challenges as the vast number of labels can exceed LLMs' input limits. In this paper, we present novel methods that combine the strengths of LLMs with dense retrieval techniques to overcome these challenges. Our approach avoids retraining by leveraging zero-shot HMC for real-time label assignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on SSRN, a large repository of preprints spanning multiple disciplines, and demonstrate significant improvements in both classification accuracy and cost-efficiency. By developing a tailored evaluation framework for dynamic taxonomies and publicly releasing our code, this research provides critical insights into applying LLMs for document classification, where the number of classes corresponds to the number of nodes in a large taxonomy, at an industrial scale.

### The Polynomial Stein Discrepancy for Assessing Moment Convergence
**Authors**: Narayan Srinivasan, Matthew Sutton, Christopher Drovandi, Leah F South

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:51:04Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel method for measuring the discrepancy between a set of samples and a desired posterior distribution for Bayesian inference. Classical methods for assessing sample quality like the effective sample size are not appropriate for scalable Bayesian sampling algorithms, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, that are asymptotically biased. Instead, the gold standard is to use the kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD), which is itself not scalable given its quadratic cost in the number of samples. The KSD and its faster extensions also typically suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality and can require extensive tuning. To address these limitations, we develop the polynomial Stein discrepancy (PSD) and an associated goodness-of-fit test. While the new test is not fully convergence-determining, we prove that it detects differences in the first r moments in the Bernstein-von Mises limit. We empirically show that the test has higher power than its competitors in several examples, and at a lower computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that the PSD can assist practitioners to select hyper-parameters of Bayesian sampling algorithms more efficiently than competitors.

### xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory
**Authors**: Maximilian Beck, Korbinian Pöppel, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, Günter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:42:07Z

**Summary**: In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

### The Prompt Canvas: A Literature-Based Practitioner Guide for Creating   Effective Prompts in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Michael Hewing, Vincent Leinhos

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:35:18Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of prompt engineering as a crucial technique for optimizing model outputs. While experimentation with various prompting methods, such as Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and role-based techniques, has yielded promising results, these advancements remain fragmented across academic papers, blog posts and anecdotal experimentation. The lack of a single, unified resource to consolidate the field's knowledge impedes the progress of both research and practical application. This paper argues for the creation of an overarching framework that synthesizes existing methodologies into a cohesive overview for practitioners. Using a design-based research approach, we present the Prompt Canvas, a structured framework resulting from an extensive literature review on prompt engineering that captures current knowledge and expertise. By combining the conceptual foundations and practical strategies identified in prompt engineering, the Prompt Canvas provides a practical approach for leveraging the potential of Large Language Models. It is primarily designed as a learning resource for pupils, students and employees, offering a structured introduction to prompt engineering. This work aims to contribute to the growing discourse on prompt engineering by establishing a unified methodology for researchers and providing guidance for practitioners.

### Another look at inference after prediction
**Authors**: Jessica Gronsbell, Jianhui Gao, Yaqi Shi, Zachary R. McCaw, David Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:34:08Z

**Summary**: Prediction-based (PB) inference is increasingly used in applications where the outcome of interest is difficult to obtain, but its predictors are readily available. Unlike traditional inference, PB inference performs statistical inference using a partially observed outcome and a set of covariates by leveraging a prediction of the outcome generated from a machine learning (ML) model. Motwani and Witten (2023) recently revisited two innovative PB inference approaches for ordinary least squares. They found that the method proposed by Wang et al. (2020) yields a consistent estimator for the association of interest when the ML model perfectly captures the underlying regression function. Conversely, the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method proposed by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) yields valid inference regardless of the model's accuracy. In this paper, we study the statistical efficiency of the PPI estimator. Our analysis reveals that a more efficient estimator, proposed 25 years ago by Chen and Chen (2000), can be obtained by simply adding a weight to the PPI estimator. We also contextualize PB inference with methods from the economics and statistics literature dating back to the 1960s. Our extensive theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the Chen and Chen (CC) estimator offers a balance between robustness to ML model specification and statistical efficiency, making it the preferred choice for use in practice.

### Fast Likelihood-free Reconstruction of Gravitational Wave Backgrounds
**Authors**: Androniki Dimitriou, Daniel G. Figueroa, Bryan Zaldivar

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:05:23Z

**Summary**: We apply state-of-the-art, likelihood-free statistical inference (machine-learning-based) techniques for reconstructing the spectral shape of a gravitational wave background (GWB). We focus on the reconstruction of an arbitrarily shaped signal by the LISA detector, but the method can be easily extended to either template-dependent signals, or to other detectors, as long as a characterisation of the instrumental noise is available. As proof of the technique, we quantify the ability of LISA to reconstruct signals of arbitrary spectral shape (${\it blind}$ reconstruction), considering a diversity of frequency profiles, and including astrophysical backgrounds in some cases. As a teaser of how the method can reconstruct signals characterised by a parameter-dependent template (${\it template}$ reconstruction), we present a dedicated study for power-law signals. While our technique has several advantages with respect to traditional MCMC methods, we validate it with the latter for concrete cases. This work opens the door for both fast and accurate Bayesian parameter estimation of GWBs, with essentially no computational overhead during the inference step. Our set of tools are integrated into the package ${\tt GWBackFinder}$, which is publicly available in https://github.com/AndronikiDimitriou/GWBackFinder.

### From Defects to Demands: A Unified, Iterative, and Heuristically Guided   LLM-Based Framework for Automated Software Repair and Requirement Realization
**Authors**: Alex, Liu, Vivian, Chi

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:54:21Z

**Summary**: This manuscript signals a new era in the integration of artificial intelligence with software engineering, placing machines at the pinnacle of coding capability. We present a formalized, iterative methodology proving that AI can fully replace human programmers in all aspects of code creation and refinement. Our approach, combining large language models with formal verification, test-driven development, and incremental architectural guidance, achieves a 38.6% improvement over the current top performer's 48.33% accuracy on the SWE-bench benchmark. This surpasses previously assumed limits, signaling the end of human-exclusive coding and the rise of autonomous AI-driven software innovation. More than a technical advance, our work challenges centuries-old assumptions about human creativity. We provide robust evidence of AI superiority, demonstrating tangible gains in practical engineering contexts and laying the foundation for a future in which computational creativity outpaces human ingenuity.

### Asteroseismic Structure Inversions of Main-Sequence Solar-like   Oscillators with Convective Cores
**Authors**: Lynn Buchele, Earl P. Bellinger, Saskia Hekker, Sarbani Basu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:50:28Z

**Summary**: Asteroseismic inferences of main-sequence solar-like oscillators often rely on best-fit models. However, these models cannot fully reproduce the observed mode frequencies, suggesting that the internal structure of the model does not fully match that of the star. Asteroseismic structure inversions provide a way to test the interior of our stellar models. Recently, structure inversion techniques were used to study 12 stars with radiative cores. In this work, we extend that analysis to 43 main-sequence stars with convective cores observed by Kepler to look for differences in the sound speed profiles in the inner 30% of the star by radius. For around half of our stars, the structure inversions show that our models reproduce the internal structure of the star, where the inversions are sensitive, within the observational uncertainties. For the stars where our inversions reveal significant differences, we find cases where our model sound speed is too high and cases where our model sound speed is too low. We use the star with the most significant differences to explore several changes to the physics of our model in an attempt to resolve the inferred differences. These changes include using a different overshoot prescription and including the effects of diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative levitation. We find that the resulting changes to the model structure are too small to resolve the differences shown in our inversions.

### Sense and Sensitivity: Evaluating the simulation of social dynamics via   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Da Ju, Adina Williams, Brian Karrer, Maximilian Nickel

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:50:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models have increasingly been proposed as a powerful replacement for classical agent-based models (ABMs) to simulate social dynamics. By using LLMs as a proxy for human behavior, the hope of this new approach is to be able to simulate significantly more complex dynamics than with classical ABMs and gain new insights in fields such as social science, political science, and economics. However, due to the black box nature of LLMs, it is unclear whether LLM agents actually execute the intended semantics that are encoded in their natural language instructions and, if the resulting dynamics of interactions are meaningful. To study this question, we propose a new evaluation framework that grounds LLM simulations within the dynamics of established reference models of social science. By treating LLMs as a black-box function, we evaluate their input-output behavior relative to this reference model, which allows us to evaluate detailed aspects of their behavior. Our results show that, while it is possible to engineer prompts that approximate the intended dynamics, the quality of these simulations is highly sensitive to the particular choice of prompts. Importantly, simulations are even sensitive to arbitrary variations such as minor wording changes and whitespace. This puts into question the usefulness of current versions of LLMs for meaningful simulations, as without a reference model, it is impossible to determine a priori what impact seemingly meaningless changes in prompt will have on the simulation.

### Towards the interoperability of low-code platforms
**Authors**: Iván Alfonso, Aaron Conrardy, Jordi Cabot

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:33:34Z

**Summary**: With the promise of accelerating software development, low-code platforms (LCPs) are becoming popular across various industries. Nevertheless, there are still barriers hindering their adoption. Among them, vendor lock-in is a major concern, especially considering the lack of interoperability between these platforms. Typically, after modeling an application in one LCP, migrating to another requires starting from scratch remodeling everything (the data model, the graphical user interface, workflows, etc.), in the new platform.   To overcome this situation, this work proposes an approach to improve the interoperability of LCPs by (semi)automatically migrating models specified in one platform to another one. The concrete migration path depends on the capabilities of the source and target tools. We first analyze popular LCPs, characterize their import and export alternatives and define transformations between those data formats when available. This is then complemented with an LLM-based solution, where image recognition features of large language models are employed to migrate models based on a simple image export of the model at hand. The full pipelines are implemented on top of the BESSER modeling framework that acts as a pivot representation between the tools.

### MultiTrust: A Comprehensive Benchmark Towards Trustworthy Multimodal   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yichi Zhang, Yao Huang, Yitong Sun, Chang Liu, Zhe Zhao, Zhengwei Fang, Yifan Wang, Huanran Chen, Xiao Yang, Xingxing Wei, Hang Su, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:21:06Z

**Summary**: Despite the superior capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, they still face significant trustworthiness challenges. Yet, current literature on the assessment of trustworthy MLLMs remains limited, lacking a holistic evaluation to offer thorough insights into future improvements. In this work, we establish MultiTrust, the first comprehensive and unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary aspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Our benchmark employs a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets. Extensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored trustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by the multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to enhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still struggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to disclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when paired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality amplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to facilitate future advancements in this important field. Code and resources are publicly available at: https://multi-trust.github.io/.

### LayerShuffle: Enhancing Robustness in Vision Transformers by Randomizing   Layer Execution Order
**Authors**: Matthias Freiberger, Peter Kun, Anders Sundnes Løvlie, Sebastian Risi

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:20:26Z

**Summary**: Due to their architecture and how they are trained, artificial neural networks are typically not robust toward pruning or shuffling layers at test time. However, such properties would be desirable for different applications, such as distributed neural network architectures where the order of execution cannot be guaranteed or parts of the network can fail during inference. In this work, we address these issues through a number of training approaches for vision transformers whose most important component is randomizing the execution order of attention modules at training time. With our proposed approaches, vision transformers are capable to adapt to arbitrary layer execution orders at test time assuming one tolerates a reduction (about 20\%) in accuracy at the same model size. We analyse the feature representations of our trained models as well as how each layer contributes to the models prediction based on its position during inference. Our analysis shows that layers learn to contribute differently based on their position in the network. Finally, we layer-prune our models at test time and find that their performance declines gracefully. Code available at https://github.com/matfrei/layershuffle.

### NVComposer: Boosting Generative Novel View Synthesis with Multiple   Sparse and Unposed Images
**Authors**: Lingen Li, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yaowei Li, Jiale Xu, Wenbo Hu, Xiaoyu Li, Weihao Cheng, Jinwei Gu, Tianfan Xue, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:56:50Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved novel view synthesis (NVS) from multi-view data. However, existing methods depend on external multi-view alignment processes, such as explicit pose estimation or pre-reconstruction, which limits their flexibility and accessibility, especially when alignment is unstable due to insufficient overlap or occlusions between views. In this paper, we propose NVComposer, a novel approach that eliminates the need for explicit external alignment. NVComposer enables the generative model to implicitly infer spatial and geometric relationships between multiple conditional views by introducing two key components: 1) an image-pose dual-stream diffusion model that simultaneously generates target novel views and condition camera poses, and 2) a geometry-aware feature alignment module that distills geometric priors from dense stereo models during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NVComposer achieves state-of-the-art performance in generative multi-view NVS tasks, removing the reliance on external alignment and thus improving model accessibility. Our approach shows substantial improvements in synthesis quality as the number of unposed input views increases, highlighting its potential for more flexible and accessible generative NVS systems.

### Sensitive Content Classification in Social Media: A Holistic Resource   and Evaluation
**Authors**: Dimosthenis Antypas, Indira Sen, Carla Perez-Almendros, Jose Camacho-Collados, Francesco Barbieri

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:41:53Z

**Summary**: The detection of sensitive content in large datasets is crucial for ensuring that shared and analysed data is free from harmful material. However, current moderation tools, such as external APIs, suffer from limitations in customisation, accuracy across diverse sensitive categories, and privacy concerns. Additionally, existing datasets and open-source models focus predominantly on toxic language, leaving gaps in detecting other sensitive categories such as substance abuse or self-harm. In this paper, we put forward a unified dataset tailored for social media content moderation across six sensitive categories: conflictual language, profanity, sexually explicit material, drug-related content, self-harm, and spam. By collecting and annotating data with consistent retrieval strategies and guidelines, we address the shortcomings of previous focalised research. Our analysis demonstrates that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on this novel dataset yields significant improvements in detection performance compared to open off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA, and even proprietary OpenAI models, which underperform by 10-15% overall. This limitation is even more pronounced on popular moderation APIs, which cannot be easily tailored to specific sensitive content categories, among others.

### LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation
**Authors**: Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:35:45Z

**Summary**: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

### Steps are all you need: Rethinking STEM Education with Prompt   Engineering
**Authors**: Krishnasai Addala, Kabir Dev Paul Baghel, Chhavi Kirtani, Avinash Anand, Rajiv Ratn Shah

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:20:57Z

**Summary**: Few shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting have shown promise when applied to Physics Question Answering Tasks, but are limited by the lack of mathematical ability inherent to LLMs, and are prone to hallucination. By utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model, along with analogical prompting, we are able to show improved model performance when compared to the baseline on standard LLMs. We also survey the limits of these prompting techniques and the effects they have on model performance. Additionally, we propose Analogical CoT prompting, a prompting technique designed to allow smaller, open source models to leverage Analogical prompting, something they have struggled with, possibly due to a lack of specialist training data.

### The Poisson-Gaussian Mixture Process: A Flexible and Robust Approach for   Non-Gaussian Geostatistical Modeling
**Authors**: F. B. Gonçalves, M. O. Prates, G. A. S. Aguilar

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:20:35Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel family of geostatistical models designed to capture complex features beyond the reach of traditional Gaussian processes. The proposed family, termed the Poisson-Gaussian Mixture Process (POGAMP), is hierarchically specified, combining the infinite-dimensional dynamics of Gaussian processes with any multivariate continuous distribution. This combination is stochastically defined by a latent Poisson process, allowing the POGAMP to define valid processes with finite-dimensional distributions that can approximate any continuous distribution. Unlike other non-Gaussian geostatistical models that may fail to ensure validity of the processes by assigning arbitrary finite-dimensional distributions, the POGAMP preserves essential probabilistic properties crucial for both modeling and inference. We establish formal results regarding the existence and properties of the POGAMP, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in capturing complex spatial patterns. To support practical applications, a carefully designed MCMC algorithm is developed for Bayesian inference when the POGAMP is discretely observed over some spatial domain.

### Quantum-Hybrid Stereo Matching With Nonlinear Regularization and Spatial   Pyramids
**Authors**: Cameron Braunstein, Eddy Ilg, Vladislav Golyanik

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:03:53Z

**Summary**: Quantum visual computing is advancing rapidly. This paper presents a new formulation for stereo matching with nonlinear regularizers and spatial pyramids on quantum annealers as a maximum a posteriori inference problem that minimizes the energy of a Markov Random Field. Our approach is hybrid (i.e., quantum-classical) and is compatible with modern D-Wave quantum annealers, i.e., it includes a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) objective. Previous quantum annealing techniques for stereo matching are limited to using linear regularizers, and thus, they do not exploit the fundamental advantages of the quantum computing paradigm in solving combinatorial optimization problems. In contrast, our method utilizes the full potential of quantum annealing for stereo matching, as nonlinear regularizers create optimization problems which are NP-hard. On the Middlebury benchmark, we achieve an improved root mean squared accuracy over the previous state of the art in quantum stereo matching of 2% and 22.5% when using different solvers.

### Eta-Earth Revisited II: Deriving a Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats   in the Galactic Disk
**Authors**: Manuel Scherf, Helmut Lammer, Laurenz Sproß

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:58:14Z

**Summary**: In Lammer et al. 2024, we defined Earth-like Habitats (EH) as rocky planets in the habitable zone of complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$ can exist and derived a formula for estimating their maximum number in the Galaxy. Here, we apply this formula by considering only requirements that are already scientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate, initial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial distribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply models for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres with various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution and upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet frequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential large moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these criteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet scientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve. We find that EHs are rare by obtaining maximum numbers of $2.5^{+71.6}_{-2.4}\times10^{5}$ and $0.6^{+27.1}_{-0.59}\times10^{5}$ planets that can potentially host N$_2$-Earth-like atmospheres with maximum CO$_2$ mixing ratios of 10\% and 1\%, respectively, implying that a minimum of $\sim 10^3 - 10^6$ rocky HZCL planets are needed for 1 EH to evolve. Their actual number, however, may be substantially lower as several requirements are not included in our model; this also implies ETIs are significantly rarer still. Our results illustrate that neither every star can host EHs, nor that each rocky HZCL planet evolves such that it may be able to host complex animal-like life. The Copernican Principle therefore cannot be applied to infer that such life is common in the Galaxy.

### LLM-Enhanced Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Analog Layout   Constraint Generation
**Authors**: Guojin Chen, Keren Zhu, Seunggeun Kim, Hanqing Zhu, Yao Lai, Bei Yu, David Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:40:53Z

**Summary**: Analog layout synthesis faces significant challenges due to its dependence on manual processes, considerable time requirements, and performance instability. Current Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based techniques for analog layout synthesis, despite their potential for automation, suffer from slow convergence and extensive data needs, limiting their practical application. This paper presents the \texttt{LLANA} framework, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance BO by exploiting the few-shot learning abilities of LLMs for more efficient generation of analog design-dependent parameter constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{LLANA} not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) BO methods but also enables a more effective exploration of the analog circuit design space, thanks to LLM's superior contextual understanding and learning efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/dekura/LLANA.

### Hallucination Detection in LLMs: Fast and Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuned   Models
**Authors**: Gabriel Y. Arteaga, Thomas B. Schön, Nicolas Pielawski

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:39:00Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work, we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.

### Temperature evolution of the Fermi surface of the FeSe monolayer on   SrTiO$_3$
**Authors**: Khalil Zakeri, Ryan Roemer, Ke Zou

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:33:44Z

**Summary**: The origin of superconductivity in the FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$ remains one of the unresolved mysteries in condensed-matter physics. Here by investigation of the temperature evolution of the dynamic charge response of FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ we infer that the response of the monolayer itself is nearly temperature independent. This indicates a constant Fermi surface over a wide range of temperature, in stark contrast to that of the bulk FeSe and other Fe-based superconductors. Our results, which manifest the peculiarity of the electronic structure of the FeSe monolayer, may help for a microscopic understanding of the superconductivity in Fe-chalcogenide monolayers on oxide surfaces in general.

### FlowPolicy: Enabling Fast and Robust 3D Flow-based Policy via   Consistency Flow Matching for Robot Manipulation
**Authors**: Qinglun Zhang, Zhen Liu, Haoqiang Fan, Guanghui Liu, Bing Zeng, Shuaicheng Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:15:24Z

**Summary**: Robots can acquire complex manipulation skills by learning policies from expert demonstrations, which is often known as vision-based imitation learning. Generating policies based on diffusion and flow matching models has been shown to be effective, particularly in robotics manipulation tasks. However, recursion-based approaches are often inference inefficient in working from noise distributions to policy distributions, posing a challenging trade-off between efficiency and quality. This motivates us to propose FlowPolicy, a novel framework for fast policy generation based on consistency flow matching and 3D vision. Our approach refines the flow dynamics by normalizing the self-consistency of the velocity field, enabling the model to derive task execution policies in a single inference step. Specifically, FlowPolicy conditions on the observed 3D point cloud, where consistency flow matching directly defines straight-line flows from different time states to the same action space, while simultaneously constraining their velocity values, that is, we approximate the trajectories from noise to robot actions by normalizing the self-consistency of the velocity field within the action space, thus improving the inference efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of FlowPolicy on Adroit and Metaworld, demonstrating a 7$\times$ increase in inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rates compared to state-of-the-art policy models. Codes will be made publicly available.

### Towards Boosting LLMs-driven Relevance Modeling with Progressive   Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting
**Authors**: Zeyuan Chen, Haiyan Wu, Kaixin Wu, Wei Chen, Mingjie Zhong, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:09:15Z

**Summary**: Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries. Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance. However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation. Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective. To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs. In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations. Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:07:44Z

**Summary**: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005$ hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H$\beta$ line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity ($Z<0.1 Z_\odot$). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 ($M_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm ~M_\odot$) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z=8.6$ can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.

### LLMs May Perform MCQA by Selecting the Least Incorrect Option
**Authors**: Haochun Wang, Sendong Zhao, Zewen Qiang, Nuwa Xi, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:54:40Z

**Summary**: In the field of NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced performance across a variety of tasks. However, the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs remains an inevitable challenge for the community. Recently, the adoption of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) as a benchmark for assessing LLMs has gained considerable traction. However, concerns regarding the robustness of this evaluative method persist. Building upon previous discussions on the issue of \textit{variability}, we reveal an additional dimension of concern: LLMs may perform MCQA by selecting the least incorrect option rather than distinctly correct. This observation suggests that LLMs might regard multiple options as correct, which could undermine the reliability of MCQA as a metric for evaluating LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce an enhanced dataset augmentation method for MCQA, termed MCQA+, to provide a more accurate reflection of the model performance, thereby highlighting the necessity for more sophisticated evaluation mechanisms in the assessment of LLM capabilities.

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:53:57Z

**Summary**: Purpose: Finding scholarly articles is a time-consuming and cumbersome activity, yet crucial for conducting science. Due to the growing number of scholarly articles, new scholarly search systems are needed to effectively assist researchers in finding relevant literature.   Methodology: We take a neuro-symbolic approach to scholarly search and exploration by leveraging state-of-the-art components, including semantic search, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The semantic search component composes a set of relevant articles. From this set of articles, information is extracted and presented to the user.   Findings: The presented system, called ORKG ASK (Assistant for Scientific Knowledge), provides a production-ready search and exploration system. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that our proposed approach is indeed suitable for the task of scholarly information retrieval.   Value: With ORKG ASK, we present a next-generation scholarly search and exploration system and make it available online. Additionally, the system components are open source with a permissive license.

### Densing Law of LLMs
**Authors**: Chaojun Xiao, Jie Cai, Weilin Zhao, Guoyang Zeng, Biyuan Lin, Jie Zhou, Zhi Zheng, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:39:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.

**Authors**: Qingyuan Li, Bo Zhang, Liang Ye, Yifan Zhang, Wei Wu, Yerui Sun, Lin Ma, Yuchen Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:29:32Z

**Summary**: The ever-increasing sizes of large language models necessitate distributed solutions for fast inference that exploit multi-dimensional parallelism, where computational loads are split across various accelerators such as GPU clusters. However, this approach often introduces significant communication overhead, especially on devices with limited bandwidth. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Flash Communication}, a novel low-bit compression technique designed to alleviate the tensor-parallelism communication bottleneck during inference. Our method substantially boosts intra-node communication speed by more than 3x and reduces the \emph{time-to-first-token} by 2x, with nearly no sacrifice in model accuracy. Extensive experiments on various up-to-date LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

**Authors**: Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:14:03Z

**Summary**: We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. This integration enhances the ability of model to understand and describe chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy. The training process involves a two-stage approach: (i) initial alignment of chest X-ray features with the LLM (ii) followed by fine-tuning for radiology report generation.

### KaLM: Knowledge-aligned Autoregressive Language Modeling via Dual-view   Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Peng Yu, Cheng Deng, Beiya Dai, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:08:24Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.

**Authors**: Yanyang Li, Tin Long Wong, Cheung To Hung, Jianqiao Zhao, Duo Zheng, Ka Wai Liu, Michael R. Lyu, Liwei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:07:44Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise, yet their evaluation raises concerns, particularly regarding data contamination due to the lack of access to proprietary training data. To address this issue, we present C$^2$LEVA, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark featuring systematic contamination prevention. C$^2$LEVA firstly offers a holistic evaluation encompassing 22 tasks, each targeting a specific application or ability of LLMs, and secondly a trustworthy assessment due to our contamination-free tasks, ensured by a systematic contamination prevention strategy that fully automates test data renewal and enforces data protection during benchmark data release. Our large-scale evaluation of 15 open-source and proprietary models demonstrates the effectiveness of C$^2$LEVA.

### Impact of the Scalar Isovector $δ$-meson on the description of   nuclear matter and neutron star properties
**Authors**: Lavínia Gabriela Teodoro dos Santos, Tuhin Malik, Constança Providência

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:06:01Z

**Summary**: The implications of including the scalar isovector $\delta$-meson in a relativistic mean-field description of nuclear matter are discussed. A Bayesian inference approach is used to determine the parameters that define the isovector properties of the model. The properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars are discussed. The inclusion of the $\delta$-meson has only a small effect on the maximum mass of the neutron star (NS) and on the speed of sound in its interior, but it has a strong effect on the radius and the tidal deformability of low and medium mass stars. This is mainly due to the effect of the $\delta$-meson on the symmetry energy and its slope and curvature at saturation, increasing the range of possible values of these three properties, and in particular allowing positive values of the symmetry energy curvature. Due to the effect of the $\delta$-meson on the symmetry energy, the proton content of the star is also strongly affected. The inclusion of the $\delta$-meson in the relativistic mean-field description of nuclear matter extends the phase space spanned by the model, allowing for a more flexible density dependence of the symmetry energy compatible with experimental, observational, and ab initio constraints.

### I Dream My Painting: Connecting MLLMs and Diffusion Models via Prompt   Generation for Text-Guided Multi-Mask Inpainting
**Authors**: Nicola Fanelli, Gennaro Vessio, Giovanna Castellano

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:58:53Z

**Summary**: Inpainting focuses on filling missing or corrupted regions of an image to blend seamlessly with its surrounding content and style. While conditional diffusion models have proven effective for text-guided inpainting, we introduce the novel task of multi-mask inpainting, where multiple regions are simultaneously inpainted using distinct prompts. Furthermore, we design a fine-tuning procedure for multimodal LLMs, such as LLaVA, to generate multi-mask prompts automatically using corrupted images as inputs. These models can generate helpful and detailed prompt suggestions for filling the masked regions. The generated prompts are then fed to Stable Diffusion, which is fine-tuned for the multi-mask inpainting problem using rectified cross-attention, enforcing prompts onto their designated regions for filling. Experiments on digitized paintings from WikiArt and the Densely Captioned Images dataset demonstrate that our pipeline delivers creative and accurate inpainting results. Our code, data, and trained models are available at https://cilabuniba.github.io/i-dream-my-painting.

### Who Speaks Next? Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of   Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games
**Authors**: Ryota Nonomura, Hiroki Mori

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:45:54Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.

### Continuous Video Process: Modeling Videos as Continuous   Multi-Dimensional Processes for Video Prediction
**Authors**: Gaurav Shrivastava, Abhinav Shrivastava

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:34:50Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have made significant strides in image generation, mastering tasks such as unconditional image synthesis, text-image translation, and image-to-image conversions. However, their capability falls short in the realm of video prediction, mainly because they treat videos as a collection of independent images, relying on external constraints such as temporal attention mechanisms to enforce temporal coherence. In our paper, we introduce a novel model class, that treats video as a continuous multi-dimensional process rather than a series of discrete frames. We also report a reduction of 75\% sampling steps required to sample a new frame thus making our framework more efficient during the inference time. Through extensive experimentation, we establish state-of-the-art performance in video prediction, validated on benchmark datasets including KTH, BAIR, Human3.6M, and UCF101.

### Endless Jailbreaks with Bijection Learning
**Authors**: Brian R. Y. Huang, Maximilian Li, Leonard Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:31:43Z

**Summary**: Despite extensive safety measures, LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, or jailbreaks, which can elicit unsafe behaviors. In this work, we introduce bijection learning, a powerful attack algorithm which automatically fuzzes LLMs for safety vulnerabilities using randomly-generated encodings whose complexity can be tightly controlled. We leverage in-context learning to teach models bijective encodings, pass encoded queries to the model to bypass built-in safety mechanisms, and finally decode responses back into English. Our attack is extremely effective on a wide range of frontier language models. Moreover, by controlling complexity parameters such as number of key-value mappings in the encodings, we find a close relationship between the capability level of the attacked LLM and the average complexity of the most effective bijection attacks. Our work highlights that new vulnerabilities in frontier models can emerge with scale: more capable models are more severely jailbroken by bijection attacks.

### Enhancing Zero-shot Chain of Thought Prompting via Uncertainty-Guided   Strategy Selection
**Authors**: Shanu Kumar, Saish Mendke, Karody Lubna Abdul Rahman, Santosh Kurasa, Parag Agrawal, Sandipan Dandapat

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:24:47Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the capability of large language models (LLMs) by structuring their reasoning processes. However, existing methods face critical limitations: handcrafted demonstrations require extensive human expertise, while trigger phrases are prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose the Zero-shot Uncertainty-based Selection (ZEUS) method, a novel approach that improves CoT prompting by utilizing uncertainty estimates to select effective demonstrations without needing access to model parameters. Unlike traditional methods, ZEUS offers high sensitivity in distinguishing between helpful and ineffective questions, ensuring more precise and reliable selection. Our extensive evaluation shows that ZEUS consistently outperforms existing CoT strategies across four challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.

**Authors**: Thevin Senath, Kumuthu Athukorala, Ransika Costa, Surangika Ranathunga, Rishemjit Kaur

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:21:25Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of recipe personalization through ingredient substitution. We make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an ingredient substitution system designed to predict plausible substitute ingredients within a given recipe context. Given that the use of LLMs for this task has been barely done, we carry out an extensive set of experiments to determine the best LLM, prompt, and the fine-tuning setups. We further experiment with methods such as multi-task learning, two-stage fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The experiments are conducted using the publicly available Recipe1MSub corpus. The best results are produced by the Mistral7-Base LLM after fine-tuning and DPO. This result outperforms the strong baseline available for the same corpus with a Hit@1 score of 22.04. Thus we believe that this research represents a significant step towards enabling personalized and creative culinary experiences by utilizing LLM-based ingredient substitution.

### Uniform characterisation of an ensemble of main-sequence benchmark   stars: effect of Gaia-based data on grid search models
**Authors**: Benard Nsamba, Achim Weiss, Juma Kamulali

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:19:45Z

**Summary**: The inference of stellar parameters (such as radius and mass) through asteroseismic forward modelling depends on the number, accuracy, and precision of seismic and atmospheric constraints. ESA's Gaia space mission is providing precise parallaxes which yield an additional constraint to be included in the model grid search. Using a handful of main-sequence benchmark stars, we perform a uniform characterisation of these stars. We assess the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters inferred from grid-based searches when a Gaia-based luminosity is combined with different stellar constraints. We also examine the precision needed for an interferometric radius (model-independent radius) to have a significant contribution towards the determination of stellar mass in the optimisation process. Our findings show that more precise stellar masses are inferred for some stars when seismic and spectroscopic constraints are complemented with a Gaia-based luminosity, with a scatter varying from 1.9 per cent to 0.8 per cent. However, the inferred stellar radii are underestimated when compared to the interferometric radii and yield a scatter of $\sim$1.9 per cent. In addition, we demonstrate that a precisely measured interferometric radius ($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) when applied in the optimisation process yields a mass with a precision $\lesssim$ 1.5 per cent. Finally, we find that when only $l=0$ mode oscillation frequencies are available, robust masses and radii are still attainable. However, this requires precise and numerous $l=0$ mode oscillations frequencies ($>$ 8) to be coupled with atmospheric constraints.

### Continuous Speech Tokens Makes LLMs Robust Multi-Modality Learners
**Authors**: Ze Yuan, Yanqing Liu, Shujie Liu, Sheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:16:04Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in GPT-4o like multi-modality models have demonstrated remarkable progress for direct speech-to-speech conversation, with real-time speech interaction experience and strong speech understanding ability. However, current research focuses on discrete speech tokens to align with discrete text tokens for language modelling, which depends on an audio codec with residual connections or independent group tokens, such a codec usually leverages large scale and diverse datasets training to ensure that the discrete speech codes have good representation for varied domain, noise, style data reconstruction as well as a well-designed codec quantizer and encoder-decoder architecture for discrete token language modelling. This paper introduces Flow-Omni, a continuous speech token based GPT-4o like model, capable of real-time speech interaction and low streaming latency. Specifically, first, instead of cross-entropy loss only, we combine flow matching loss with a pretrained autoregressive LLM and a small MLP network to predict the probability distribution of the continuous-valued speech tokens from speech prompt. second, we incorporated the continuous speech tokens to Flow-Omni multi-modality training, thereby achieving robust speech-to-speech performance with discrete text tokens and continuous speech tokens together. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to discrete text and speech multi-modality training and its variants, the continuous speech tokens mitigate robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of discrete speech code's representation loss for LLM.

### SCMM: Calibrating Cross-modal Representations for Text-Based Person   Search
**Authors**: Jing Liu, Donglai Wei, Yang Liu, Sipeng Zhang, Tong Yang, Victor C. M. Leung

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:13:10Z

**Summary**: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) is a crucial task in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain that enables accurate retrieval of target individuals from large-scale galleries with only given textual caption. For cross-modal TBPS tasks, it is critical to obtain well-distributed representation in the common embedding space to reduce the inter-modal gap. Furthermore, learning detailed image-text correspondences is essential to discriminate similar targets and enable fine-grained search. To address these challenges, we present a simple yet effective method named Sew Calibration and Masked Modeling (SCMM) that calibrates cross-modal representations by learning compact and well-aligned embeddings. SCMM introduces two novel losses for fine-grained cross-modal representations: Sew calibration loss that aligns image and text features based on textual caption quality, and Masked Caption Modeling (MCM) loss that establishes detailed relationships between textual and visual parts. This dual-pronged strategy enhances feature alignment and cross-modal correspondences, enabling accurate distinction of similar individuals while maintaining a streamlined dual-encoder architecture for real-time inference, which is essential for resource-limited sensors and IoT systems. Extensive experiments on three popular TBPS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SCMM, achieving 73.81%, 64.25%, and 57.35% Rank-1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID, respectively.

**Authors**: Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:01:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes of human-machine interaction, leading to the accumulation of vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. A conversational life-cycle spans from the Prelude through the Interlocution to the Epilogue, encompassing various elements. Despite the existence of numerous dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmarks that encompass comprehensive dialogue elements, hindering precise modeling and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. Inspired by imitation learning, we further build the agent which possesses the adept ability to model dialogue elements based on the DEMO benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that existing LLMs still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent has superior performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

### EACO: Enhancing Alignment in Multimodal LLMs via Critical Observation
**Authors**: Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:59:47Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.

### Noise Self-Regression: A New Learning Paradigm to Enhance Low-Light   Images Without Task-Related Data
**Authors**: Zhao Zhang, Suiyi Zhao, Xiaojie Jin, Mingliang Xu, Yi Yang, Shuicheng Yan, Meng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:46:09Z

**Summary**: Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a task of leveraging deep neural networks to enhance the image illumination while keeping the image content unchanged. From the perspective of training data, existing methods complete the LLIE task driven by one of the following three data types: paired data, unpaired data and zero-reference data. Each type of these data-driven methods has its own advantages, e.g., zero-reference data-based methods have very low requirements on training data and can meet the human needs in many scenarios. In this paper, we leverage pure Gaussian noise to complete the LLIE task, which further reduces the requirements for training data in LLIE tasks and can be used as another alternative in practical use. Specifically, we propose Noise SElf-Regression (NoiSER) without access to any task-related data, simply learns a convolutional neural network equipped with an instance-normalization layer by taking a random noise image, $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ for each pixel, as both input and output for each training pair, and then the low-light image is fed to the trained network for predicting the normal-light image. Technically, an intuitive explanation for its effectiveness is as follows: 1) the self-regression reconstructs the contrast between adjacent pixels of the input image, 2) the instance-normalization layer may naturally remediate the overall magnitude/lighting of the input image, and 3) the $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ assumption for each pixel enforces the output image to follow the well-known gray-world hypothesis when the image size is big enough. Compared to current state-of-the-art LLIE methods with access to different task-related data, NoiSER is highly competitive in enhancement quality, yet with a much smaller model size, and much lower training and inference cost. Besides, NoiSER also excels in mitigating overexposure and handling joint tasks.

**Authors**: Yuhang Ming, Xingrui Yang, Weihan Wang, Zheng Chen, Jinglun Feng, Yifan Xing, Guofeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:34:43Z

**Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D scene representation, offering high-fidelity renderings and reconstructions from a set of sparse and unstructured sensor data. In the context of autonomous robotics, where perception and understanding of the environment are pivotal, NeRF holds immense promise for improving performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for utilizing NeRF to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots. We especially focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous operation, including 3D reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and planning, and interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we explore promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. Notably, we discuss the integration of advanced techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), large language models (LLM), and generative AIs, envisioning enhanced reconstruction efficiency, scene understanding, decision-making capabilities. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRFs to empower autonomous robots, paving the way for innovative solutions that can navigate and interact seamlessly in complex environments.

### Autoformalize Mathematical Statements by Symbolic Equivalence and   Semantic Consistency
**Authors**: Zenan Li, Yifan Wu, Zhaoyu Li, Xinming Wei, Xian Zhang, Fan Yang, Xiaoxing Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:06:20Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization, the task of automatically translating natural language descriptions into a formal language, poses a significant challenge across various domains, especially in mathematics. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unveiled their promising capabilities to formalize even competition-level math problems. However, we observe a considerable discrepancy between pass@1 and pass@k accuracies in LLM-generated formalizations. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework that scores and selects the best result from k autoformalization candidates based on two complementary self-consistency methods: symbolic equivalence and semantic consistency. Elaborately, symbolic equivalence identifies the logical homogeneity among autoformalization candidates using automated theorem provers, and semantic consistency evaluates the preservation of the original meaning by informalizing the candidates and computing the similarity between the embeddings of the original and informalized texts. Our extensive experiments on the MATH and miniF2F datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances autoformalization accuracy, achieving up to 0.22-1.35x relative improvements across various LLMs and baseline methods.

### COBias and Debias: Minimizing Language Model Pairwise Accuracy Bias via   Nonlinear Integer Programming
**Authors**: Ruixi Lin, Yang You

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:04:55Z

**Summary**: When performing classification tasks with language models, would you prefer having only one highly accurate class or having every class deliver reliable performance? Obviously, a more balanced accuracy among classes better reflects the expectations of the majority of users. Especially for large language models (LLMs), the fact that they achieve a fair overall accuracy by in-context learning (ICL) obscures a large difference in individual class accuracies. In this work, we uncover and tackle language models' imbalance in per-class prediction accuracy by reconceptualizing it as the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), and we are the first to engage nonlinear integer programming (NIP) to debias it. Briefly, the proposed COBias metric measures accuracy differences among class pairs, with which we reveal the large per-class accuracy differences exhibited in LLMs of varied scales and families. Then we propose Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) to correct ICL per-class probabilities towards lower COBias and higher overall accuracy. Our optimization objective is directly based on the evaluation scores by COBias and accuracy metrics, which is non-differentiable and solved by the simulated annealing metaheuristic. Evaluations on three LLMs across seven NLP classification tasks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves significant COBias reduction (-27%) and accuracy improvement (+12%) over the conventional ICL approach, suggesting that modeling pairwise class accuracy differences is a direction in pushing forward more accurate, more reliable LLM predictions.

### Building a Family of Data Augmentation Models for Low-cost LLM   Fine-tuning on the Cloud
**Authors**: Yuanhao Yue, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Peng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:04:12Z

**Summary**: Specializing LLMs in various domain-specific tasks has emerged as a critical step towards achieving high performance. However, the construction and annotation of datasets in specific domains are always very costly. Apart from using superior and expensive closed-source LLM APIs to construct datasets, some open-source models have become strong enough to handle dataset construction in many scenarios. Thus, we present a family of data augmentation models designed to significantly improve the efficiency for model fine-tuning. These models, trained based on sufficiently small LLMs, support key functionalities with low inference costs: instruction expansion, instruction refinement, and instruction-response pair expansion. To fulfill this goal, we first construct an automatic data collection system with seed datasets generated from both public repositories and our in-house datasets. This system leverages powerful LLMs to expand, refine and re-write the instructions and responses, incorporating quality assessment techniques. Following this, we introduce the training process of our models, which effectively distills task-solving and text synthesis abilities from teacher LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate how we integrate these functionalities into a machine learning platform to support low-cost LLM fine-tuning from both dataset preparation and training perspectives for users. Experiments and an application study prove the effectiveness of our approach.

### BodyMetric: Evaluating the Realism of Human Bodies in Text-to-Image   Generation
**Authors**: Nefeli Andreou, Varsha Vivek, Ying Wang, Alex Vorobiov, Tiffany Deng, Raja Bala, Larry Davis, Betty Mohler Tesch

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:00:39Z

**Summary**: Accurately generating images of human bodies from text remains a challenging problem for state of the art text-to-image models. Commonly observed body-related artifacts include extra or missing limbs, unrealistic poses, blurred body parts, etc. Currently, evaluation of such artifacts relies heavily on time-consuming human judgments, limiting the ability to benchmark models at scale. We address this by proposing BodyMetric, a learnable metric that predicts body realism in images. BodyMetric is trained on realism labels and multi-modal signals including 3D body representations inferred from the input image, and textual descriptions. In order to facilitate this approach, we design an annotation pipeline to collect expert ratings on human body realism leading to a new dataset for this task, namely, BodyRealism. Ablation studies support our architectural choices for BodyMetric and the importance of leveraging a 3D human body prior in capturing body-related artifacts in 2D images. In comparison to concurrent metrics which evaluate general user preference in images, BodyMetric specifically reflects body-related artifacts. We demonstrate the utility of BodyMetric through applications that were previously infeasible at scale. In particular, we use BodyMetric to benchmark the generation ability of text-to-image models to produce realistic human bodies. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of BodyMetric in ranking generated images based on the predicted realism scores.

**Summary**: Precision metrology underpins scientific and technological advancements. Quantum metrology offers a pathway to surpass classical sensing limits by leveraging quantum states and measurement strategies. However, measuring multiple incompatible observables suffers from quantum backaction, where measurement of one observable pollutes a subsequent measurement of the other. This is a manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for two non-commuting observables, such as position and momentum. Here, we demonstrate measurements of small changes in position and momentum where the uncertainties are simultaneously reduced below the standard quantum limit (SQL). We measure $\textit{modular observables}$ using tailored, highly non-classical states that ideally evade measurement backactions. The states are deterministically prepared in the single mode of the mechanical motion of a trapped ion using an optimal quantum control protocol. Our experiment uses grid states to measure small changes in position and momentum and shows a metrological gain of up to 5.1(5)~dB over the simultaneous SQL. Using an adaptive-phase estimation algorithm with Bayesian inference, we estimate these displacements with a combined variance of 2.6(1.1)~dB below the SQL. Furthermore, we examine simultaneously estimating $\textit{number}$ and $\textit{phase}$, which are the polar counterparts of position and momentum. This is performed by preparing a novel quantum resource -- number-phase states -- and we demonstrate a metrological gain over their SQL. The combination of quantum control and multi-parameter quantum metrology marks a significant step towards unprecedented precision with applications ranging from fundamental physics to advanced quantum technologies.

**Authors**: Rajat Rawat, Hudson McBride, Dhiyaan Nirmal, Rajarshi Ghosh, Jong Moon, Dhruv Alamuri, Sean O'Brien, Kevin Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:53:43Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) gain traction in healthcare, concerns about their susceptibility to demographic biases are growing. We introduce {DiversityMedQA}, a novel benchmark designed to assess LLM responses to medical queries across diverse patient demographics, such as gender and ethnicity. By perturbing questions from the MedQA dataset, which comprises medical board exam questions, we created a benchmark that captures the nuanced differences in medical diagnosis across varying patient profiles. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies in model performance when tested against these demographic variations. Furthermore, to ensure the perturbations were accurate, we also propose a filtering strategy that validates each perturbation. By releasing DiversityMedQA, we provide a resource for evaluating and mitigating demographic bias in LLM medical diagnoses.

### Breaking Event Rumor Detection via Stance-Separated Multi-Agent Debate
**Authors**: Mingqing Zhang, Haisong Gong, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:52:30Z

**Summary**: The rapid spread of rumors on social media platforms during breaking events severely hinders the dissemination of the truth. Previous studies reveal that the lack of annotated resources hinders the direct detection of unforeseen breaking events not covered in yesterday's news. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for rumor detection holds significant promise. However, it is challenging for LLMs to provide comprehensive responses to complex or controversial issues due to limited diversity. In this work, we propose the Stance Separated Multi-Agent Debate (S2MAD) to address this issue. Specifically, we firstly introduce Stance Separation, categorizing comments as either supporting or opposing the original claim. Subsequently, claims are classified as subjective or objective, enabling agents to generate reasonable initial viewpoints with different prompt strategies for each type of claim. Debaters then follow specific instructions through multiple rounds of debate to reach a consensus. If a consensus is not reached, a judge agent evaluates the opinions and delivers a final verdict on the claim's veracity. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and effectively improves the performance of LLMs in breaking event rumor detection.

### Neuro-Symbolic Data Generation for Math Reasoning
**Authors**: Zenan Li, Zhi Zhou, Yuan Yao, Yu-Feng Li, Chun Cao, Fan Yang, Xian Zhang, Xiaoxing Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:49:49Z

**Summary**: A critical question about Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether their apparent deficiency in mathematical reasoning is inherent, or merely a result of insufficient exposure to high-quality mathematical data. To explore this, we developed an automated method for generating high-quality, supervised mathematical datasets. The method carefully mutates existing math problems, ensuring both diversity and validity of the newly generated problems. This is achieved by a neuro-symbolic data generation framework combining the intuitive informalization strengths of LLMs, and the precise symbolic reasoning of math solvers along with projected Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in the highly-irregular symbolic space. Empirical experiments demonstrate the high quality of data generated by the proposed method, and that the LLMs, specifically LLaMA-2 and Mistral, when realigned with the generated data, surpass their state-of-the-art counterparts.

### Can Large Language Models Effectively Process and Execute Financial   Trading Instructions?
**Authors**: Yu Kang, Ge Wang, Xin Yang, Yuda Wang, Mingwen Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:48:49Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created transformative opportunities for the financial industry, especially in the area of financial trading. However, how to integrate LLMs with trading systems has become a challenge. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent trade order recognition pipeline that enables the conversion of trade orders into a standard format in trade execution. The system improves the ability of human traders to interact with trading platforms while addressing the problem of misinformation acquisition in trade execution. In addition, we have created a trade order dataset of 500 pieces of data to simulate real-world trading scenarios. Moreover, we designed several metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset reliability and the generative power of big models in finance by experimenting with five state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset. The results indicate that while LLMs demonstrate high generation rates (87.50% to 98.33%) and perfect follow-up rates, they face significant challenges in accuracy (5% to 10%) and completeness, with high missing rates (14.29% to 67.29%). In addition, LLMs tend to over-interrogate, suggesting that large models tend to collect more information, carrying certain challenges for information security.

### PropertyGPT: LLM-driven Formal Verification of Smart Contracts through   Retrieval-Augmented Property Generation
**Authors**: Ye Liu, Yue Xue, Daoyuan Wu, Yuqiang Sun, Yi Li, Miaolei Shi, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:41:01Z

**Summary**: With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs,such as GPT-4, to transfer existing human-written properties (e.g.,those from Certora auditing reports) and automatically generate customized properties for unknown code. To this end, we embed existing properties into a vector database and retrieve a reference property for LLM-based in-context learning to generate a new property for a given code. While this basic process is relatively straightforward, ensuring that the generated properties are (i) compilable, (ii) appropriate, and (iii) verifiable presents challenges. To address (i), we use the compilation and static analysis feedback as an external oracle to guide LLMs in iteratively revising the generated properties. For (ii), we consider multiple dimensions of similarity to rank the properties and employ a weighted algorithm to identify the top-K properties as the final result. For (iii), we design a dedicated prover to formally verify the correctness of the generated properties. We have implemented these strategies into a novel LLM-based property generation tool called PropertyGPT. Our experiments show that PropertyGPT can generate comprehensive and high-quality properties, achieving an 80% recall compared to the ground truth. It successfully detected 26 CVEs/attack incidents out of 37 tested and also uncovered 12 zero-day vulnerabilities, leading to $8,256 in bug bounty rewards.

### Plentiful Jailbreaks with String Compositions
**Authors**: Brian R. Y. Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:39:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to a slew of adversarial attacks and jailbreaking methods. One common approach employed by white-hat attackers, or red-teamers, is to process model inputs and outputs using string-level obfuscations, which can include leetspeak, rotary ciphers, Base64, ASCII, and more. Our work extends these encoding-based attacks by unifying them in a framework of invertible string transformations. With invertibility, we can devise arbitrary string compositions, defined as sequences of transformations, that we can encode and decode end-to-end programmatically. We devise a automated best-of-n attack that samples from a combinatorially large number of string compositions. Our jailbreaks obtain competitive attack success rates on several leading frontier models when evaluated on HarmBench, highlighting that encoding-based attacks remain a persistent vulnerability even in advanced LLMs.

### NeuroNAS: A Framework for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic   Compute-in-Memory Systems using Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture   Search
**Authors**: Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:35:27Z

**Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated capabilities for solving diverse machine learning tasks with ultra-low power/energy consumption. To maximize the performance and efficiency of SNN inference, the Compute-in-Memory (CIM) hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) have been employed. However, SNN architectures are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying CIM hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems using a hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). NeuroNAS employs the following key steps: (1) optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, (2) employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, (3) developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and (4) devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art, NeuroNAS with 8bit weight precision quickly finds SNNs that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency speed-ups, 84% energy savings across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200 datasets; while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once. In this manner, NeuroNAS enables efficient design automation in developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems for diverse ML-based applications.

### U-MATH: A University-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Skills   in LLMs
**Authors**: Konstantin Chernyshev, Vitaliy Polshkov, Ekaterina Artemova, Alex Myasnikov, Vlad Stepanov, Alexei Miasnikov, Sergei Tilga

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:29:43Z

**Summary**: The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.   To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.   The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.

### Customized Generation Reimagined: Fidelity and Editability Harmonized
**Authors**: Jian Jin, Yang Shen, Zhenyong Fu, Jian Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:54:34Z

**Summary**: Customized generation aims to incorporate a novel concept into a pre-trained text-to-image model, enabling new generations of the concept in novel contexts guided by textual prompts. However, customized generation suffers from an inherent trade-off between concept fidelity and editability, i.e., between precisely modeling the concept and faithfully adhering to the prompts. Previous methods reluctantly seek a compromise and struggle to achieve both high concept fidelity and ideal prompt alignment simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a Divide, Conquer, then Integrate (DCI) framework, which performs a surgical adjustment in the early stage of denoising to liberate the fine-tuned model from the fidelity-editability trade-off at inference. The two conflicting components in the trade-off are decoupled and individually conquered by two collaborative branches, which are then selectively integrated to preserve high concept fidelity while achieving faithful prompt adherence. To obtain a better fine-tuned model, we introduce an Image-specific Context Optimization} (ICO) strategy for model customization. ICO replaces manual prompt templates with learnable image-specific contexts, providing an adaptive and precise fine-tuning direction to promote the overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reconciling the fidelity-editability trade-off.

### MobileFlow: A Multimodal LLM For Mobile GUI Agent
**Authors**: Songqin Nong, Jiali Zhu, Rui Wu, Jiongchao Jin, Shuo Shan, Xiutian Huang, Wenhao Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:43:34Z

**Summary**: Currently, the integration of mobile Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is ubiquitous in most people's daily lives. And the ongoing evolution of multimodal large-scale models, such as GPT-4v, Qwen-VL-Max, has significantly bolstered the capabilities of GUI comprehension and user action analysis, showcasing the potentiality of intelligent GUI assistants. However, current GUI Agents often need to access page layout information through calling system APIs, which may pose privacy risks. Fixing GUI (such as mobile interfaces) to a certain low resolution might result in the loss of fine-grained image details. At the same time, the multimodal large models built for GUI Agents currently have poor understanding and decision-making abilities for Chinese GUI interfaces, making them difficult to apply to a large number of Chinese apps. This paper introduces MobileFlow, a multimodal large language model meticulously crafted for mobile GUI agents. Transforming from the open-source model Qwen-VL-Chat into GUI domain, MobileFlow contains approximately 21 billion parameters and is equipped with novel hybrid visual encoders, making it possible for variable resolutions of image inputs and good support for multilingual GUI. By incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoE) expansions and pioneering alignment training strategies, MobileFlow has the capacity to fully interpret image data and comprehend user instructions for GUI interaction tasks. Finally, MobileFlow outperforms Qwen-VL-Max and GPT-4v in terms of task execution by GUI agents on both public and our proposed evaluation metrics, and has been successfully deployed in real-world business contexts, proving its effectiveness for practical applications.

### LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware   Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos
**Authors**: Tiantian Geng, Jinrui Zhang, Qingni Wang, Teng Wang, Jinming Duan, Feng Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:24:10Z

**Summary**: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.

### OPT-Tree: Speculative Decoding with Adaptive Draft Tree Structure
**Authors**: Jikai Wang, Yi Su, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Zi Ye, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:13:53Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive language models demonstrate excellent performance in various scenarios. However, the inference efficiency is limited by its one-step-one-word generation mode, which has become a pressing problem recently as the models become increasingly larger. Speculative decoding employs a "draft and then verify" mechanism to allow multiple tokens to be generated in one step, realizing lossless acceleration. Existing methods mainly adopt fixed heuristic draft structures, which fail to adapt to different situations to maximize the acceptance length during verification. To alleviate this dilemma, we proposed OPT-Tree, an algorithm to construct adaptive and scalable draft trees. It searches the optimal tree structure that maximizes the mathematical expectation of the acceptance length in each decoding step. Experimental results reveal that OPT-Tree outperforms the existing draft structures and achieves a speed-up ratio of up to 3.2 compared with autoregressive decoding. If the draft model is powerful enough and the node budget is sufficient, it can generate more than ten tokens in a single step. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jikai0Wang/OPT-Tree.

### ChromaDistill: Colorizing Monochrome Radiance Fields with Knowledge   Distillation
**Authors**: Ankit Dhiman, R Srinath, Srinjay Sarkar, Lokesh R Boregowda, R Venkatesh Babu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:11:33Z

**Summary**: Colorization is a well-explored problem in the domains of image and video processing. However, extending colorization to 3D scenes presents significant challenges. Recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian-Splatting(3DGS) methods enable high-quality novel-view synthesis for multi-view images. However, the question arises: How can we colorize these 3D representations? This work presents a method for synthesizing colorized novel views from input grayscale multi-view images. Using image or video colorization methods to colorize novel views from these 3D representations naively will yield output with severe inconsistencies. We introduce a novel method to use powerful image colorization models for colorizing 3D representations. We propose a distillation-based method that transfers color from these networks trained on natural images to the target 3D representation. Notably, this strategy does not add any additional weights or computational overhead to the original representation during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality colorized views for indoor and outdoor scenes, showcasing significant cross-view consistency advantages over baseline approaches. Our method is agnostic to the underlying 3D representation and easily generalizable to NeRF and 3DGS methods. Further, we validate the efficacy of our approach in several diverse applications: 1.) Infra-Red (IR) multi-view images and 2.) Legacy grayscale multi-view image sequences. Project Webpage: https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/chroma-distill.github.io/

### Automated Federated Pipeline for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Xianhao Chen, Yue Gao, Yuguang Fang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:10:30Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a surge in the development of advanced intelligent generative content (AIGC), especially large language models (LLMs). However, for many downstream tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using private data. While federated learning offers a promising privacy-preserving solution to LLM fine-tuning, the substantial size of an LLM, combined with high computational and communication demands, makes it hard to apply to downstream tasks. More importantly, private edge servers often possess varying computing and network resources in real-world scenarios, introducing additional complexities to LLM fine-tuning. To tackle these problems, we design and implement an automated federated pipeline, named FedPipe, to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training cost but without adding any inference latency. FedPipe firstly identifies the weights to be fine-tuned based on their contributions to the LLM training. It then configures a low-rank adapter for each selected weight to train local low-rank adapters on an edge server, and aggregate local adapters of all edge servers to fine-tune the whole LLM. Finally, it appropriately quantizes the parameters of LLM to reduce memory space according to the requirements of edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPipe expedites the model training and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

### SJTU:Spatial judgments in multimodal models towards unified segmentation   through coordinate detection
**Authors**: Joongwon Chae, Zhenyu Wang, Peiwu Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:08:56Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advances in vision-language understanding, implementing image segmentation within multimodal architectures remains a fundamental challenge in modern artificial intelligence systems. Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in Multimodal Models - Towards Unified Segmentation through Coordinate Detection, a framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework presents an approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models through spatial inference in multimodal space. By utilizing normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and transforming them into actionable segmentation outputs, we establish a connection between spatial and language representations in multimodal architectures. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets, achieving IoU scores of 0.5958 on COCO 2017 and 0.6758 on Pascal VOC. Testing on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 512x512 resolution images yields an average inference time of 7 seconds per image, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in both accuracy and practical deployability.

### PsycoLLM: Enhancing LLM for Psychological Understanding and Evaluation
**Authors**: Jinpeng Hu, Tengteng Dong, Luo Gang, Hui Ma, Peng Zou, Xiao Sun, Dan Guo, Xun Yang, Meng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:51:46Z

**Summary**: Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and LLM can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue. However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a specialized psychological large language model (LLM), named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multi-turn dialogues and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multi-turn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other LLMs.

### Intent-based Meta-Scheduling in Programmable Networks: A Research Agenda
**Authors**: Nanjangud C. Narendra, Ronak Kanthaliya, Venkatareddy Akumalla

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:35:41Z

**Summary**: The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called ''programmable'' networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network.   To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment. Our research agenda will comprise a strawman architecture for meta-scheduling and a set of research questions that need to be addressed to make intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling a reality.

### Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with LLMs via Nearest Neighbor   Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Jayanie Bogahawatte, Sachith Seneviratne, Maneesha Perera, Saman Halgamuge

**Summary**: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.

### Practicing Stress Relief for the Everyday: Designing Social Simulation   Using VR, AR, and LLMs
**Authors**: Anna Fang, Hriday Chhabria, Alekhya Maram, Haiyi Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:25:54Z

**Summary**: Stress is an inevitable part of day-to-day life yet many find themselves unable to manage it themselves, particularly when professional or peer support are not always readily available. As self-care becomes increasingly vital for mental well-being, this paper explores the potential of social simulation as a safe, virtual environment for practicing stress relief for everyday situations. Leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR, AR, and LLMs, we developed eight interactive prototypes for various everyday stressful scenarios (e.g. public speaking) then conducted prototype-driven semi-structured interviews with 19 participants. We reveal that people currently lack effective means to support themselves through everyday stress and found that social simulation fills a gap for simulating real environments for training mental health practices. We outline key considerations for future development of simulation for self-care, including risks of trauma from hyper-realism, distrust of LLM-recommended timing for mental health recommendations, and the value of accessibility for self-care interventions.

### Modality Decoupling is All You Need: A Simple Solution for Unsupervised   Hyperspectral Image Fusion
**Authors**: Songcheng Du, Yang Zou, Zixu Wang, Xingyuan Li, Ying Li, Qiang Shen

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:22:43Z

**Summary**: Hyperspectral Image Fusion (HIF) aims to fuse low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs) to reconstruct high spatial and high spectral resolution images. Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without valid supervision, failing to fully perceive the deep modality-complementary information and hence, resulting in a superficial understanding of inter-modality connections. To bridge this gap, we propose a simple and effective solution for unsupervised HIF with an assumption that modality decoupling is essential for HIF. We introduce the modality clustering loss that ensures clear guidance of the modality, decoupling towards modality-shared features while steering clear of modality-complementary ones. Also, we propose an end-to-end Modality-Decoupled Spatial-Spectral Fusion (MossFuse) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of the LR-HSI and HR-MSI to reduce the modality redundancy. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time.

### Estimating the treatment effect over time under general interference   through deep learner integrated TMLE
**Authors**: Suhan Guo, Furao Shen, Ni Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:09:43Z

**Summary**: Understanding the effects of quarantine policies in populations with underlying social networks is crucial for public health, yet most causal inference methods fail here due to their assumption of independent individuals. We introduce DeepNetTMLE, a deep-learning-enhanced Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) method designed to estimate time-sensitive treatment effects in observational data. DeepNetTMLE mitigates bias from time-varying confounders under general interference by incorporating a temporal module and domain adversarial training to build intervention-invariant representations. This process removes associations between current treatments and historical variables, while the targeting step maintains the bias-variance trade-off, enhancing the reliability of counterfactual predictions. Using simulations of a ``Susceptible-Infected-Recovered'' model with varied quarantine coverages, we show that DeepNetTMLE achieves lower bias and more precise confidence intervals in counterfactual estimates, enabling optimal quarantine recommendations within budget constraints, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance
**Authors**: Hanqing Zhu, Zhenyu Zhang, Wenyan Cong, Xi Liu, Sem Park, Vikas Chandra, Bo Long, David Z. Pan, Zhangyang Wang, Jinwon Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:55:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.

### On the Generalization of Preference Learning with DPO
**Authors**: Shawn Im, Yixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:31:30Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking. This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses on overparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent of the training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound the generalization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, under specific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferred responses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theoretical findings.

**Authors**: Saransh Kumar Gupta, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Geeta Trilok-Kumar, Ramesh Jain

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:27:15Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG.in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.

### CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite   Captions
**Authors**: Xiaohui Chen, Satya Narayan Shukla, Mahmoud Azab, Aashu Singh, Qifan Wang, David Yang, ShengYun Peng, Hanchao Yu, Shen Yan, Xuewen Zhang, Baosheng He

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:22:47Z

**Summary**: How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.

### A Practitioner's Guide to Continual Multimodal Pretraining
**Authors**: Karsten Roth, Vishaal Udandarao, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Mehdi Cherti, Oriol Vinyals, Olivier Hénaff, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge, Zeynep Akata

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:22:32Z

**Summary**: Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language. Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time. To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates. However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model. In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios. We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling. Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment. Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.

### LIAR: Leveraging Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds
**Authors**: James Beetham, Souradip Chakraborty, Mengdi Wang, Furong Huang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mubarak Shah

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T18:02:59Z

**Summary**: Many existing jailbreak techniques rely on solving discrete combinatorial optimization, while more recent approaches involve training LLMs to generate multiple adversarial prompts. However, both approaches require significant computational resources to produce even a single adversarial prompt. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of current approaches stems from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem. To address this gap, we formulate the jailbreak problem in terms of alignment. By starting from an available safety-aligned model, we leverage an unsafe reward to guide the safe model towards generating unsafe outputs using alignment techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), effectively performing jailbreaking via alignment. We propose a novel jailbreak method called LIAR (LeveragIng Alignment to jailbReak). To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, we employ a best-of-N method to solve the alignment problem. LIAR offers significant advantages: lower computational requirements without additional training, fully black-box operation, competitive attack success rates, and more human-readable prompts. We provide theoretical insights into the possibility of jailbreaking a safety-aligned model, revealing inherent vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies for LLMs. We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed \algo. Experimentally, we achieve ASR comparable to the SoTA with a 10x improvement to perplexity and a Time-to-Attack measured in seconds rather than tens of hours.

### BEExformer: A Fast Inferencing Transformer Architecture via Binarization   with Multiple Early Exits
**Authors**: Wazib Ansar, Saptarsi Goswami, Amlan Chakrabarti

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:58:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the GLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.

### 100% Hallucination Elimination Using Acurai
**Authors**: Michael C. Wood, Adam A. Forbes

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:54:54Z

**Summary**: The issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in enterprise and other high-stakes applications. Despite advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve more than 80% accuracy in generating faithful and factually correct outputs, even when provided with relevant and accurate context. In this work, we introduce Acurai, a novel systematic approach that achieves 100% hallucination-free responses in LLMs by reformatting queries and context data prior to input. Leveraging a deep understanding of LLM internal representations, the importance of noun-phrase dominance, and the role of discrete functional units (DFUs), Acurai ensures alignment between input context and generated output. We validate this method using the RAGTruth corpus, demonstrating its ability to eliminate 100% hallucinations for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Acurai sets a new standard for achieving consistent, accurate, and faithful AI responses, marking a significant step forward in the development of trustworthy AI systems.

### Evaluating and Aligning CodeLLMs on Human Preference
**Authors**: Jian Yang, Jiaxi Yang, Ke Jin, Yibo Miao, Lei Zhang, Liqun Yang, Zeyu Cui, Yichang Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:40:38Z

**Summary**: Code large language models (codeLLMs) have made significant strides in code generation. Most previous code-related benchmarks, which consist of various programming exercises along with the corresponding test cases, are used as a common measure to evaluate the performance and capabilities of code LLMs. However, the current code LLMs focus on synthesizing the correct code snippet, ignoring the alignment with human preferences, where the query should be sampled from the practical application scenarios and the model-generated responses should satisfy the human preference. To bridge the gap between the model-generated response and human preference, we present a rigorous human-curated benchmark CodeArena to emulate the complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, where 397 high-quality samples spanning 40 categories and 44 programming languages, carefully curated from user queries. Further, we propose a diverse synthetic instruction corpus SynCode-Instruct (nearly 20B tokens) by scaling instructions from the website to verify the effectiveness of the large-scale synthetic instruction fine-tuning, where Qwen2.5-SynCoder totally trained on synthetic instruction data can achieve top-tier performance of open-source code LLMs. The results find performance differences between execution-based benchmarks and CodeArena. Our systematic experiments of CodeArena on 40+ LLMs reveal a notable performance gap between open SOTA code LLMs (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1), underscoring the importance of the human preference alignment.\footnote{\url{https://codearenaeval.github.io/ }}

**Authors**: Aditi Singh, Akash Shetty, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:36:28Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL systems facilitate smooth interaction with databases by translating natural language queries into Structured Query Language (SQL), bridging the gap between non-technical users and complex database management systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI-driven text-to-SQL systems, highlighting their foundational components, advancements in large language model (LLM) architectures, and the critical role of datasets such as Spider, WikiSQL, and CoSQL in driving progress. We examine the applications of text-to-SQL in domains like healthcare, education, and finance, emphasizing their transformative potential for improving data accessibility. Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL databases and dynamic real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline future research directions, such as extending text-to-SQL capabilities to support NoSQL databases, designing datasets for dynamic multi-turn interactions, and optimizing systems for real-world scalability and robustness. By surveying current advancements and identifying key gaps, this paper aims to guide the next generation of research and applications in LLM-based text-to-SQL systems.

### ConQRet: Benchmarking Fine-Grained Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented   Argumentation with LLM Judges
**Authors**: Kaustubh D. Dhole, Kai Shu, Eugene Agichtein

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:35:52Z

**Summary**: Computational argumentation, which involves generating answers or summaries for controversial topics like abortion bans and vaccination, has become increasingly important in today's polarized environment. Sophisticated LLM capabilities offer the potential to provide nuanced, evidence-based answers to such questions through Retrieval-Augmented Argumentation (RAArg), leveraging real-world evidence for high-quality, grounded arguments. However, evaluating RAArg remains challenging, as human evaluation is costly and difficult for complex, lengthy answers on complicated topics. At the same time, re-using existing argumentation datasets is no longer sufficient, as they lack long, complex arguments and realistic evidence from potentially misleading sources, limiting holistic evaluation of retrieval effectiveness and argument quality. To address these gaps, we investigate automated evaluation methods using multiple fine-grained LLM judges, providing better and more interpretable assessments than traditional single-score metrics and even previously reported human crowdsourcing. To validate the proposed techniques, we introduce ConQRet, a new benchmark featuring long and complex human-authored arguments on debated topics, grounded in real-world websites, allowing an exhaustive evaluation across retrieval effectiveness, argument quality, and groundedness. We validate our LLM Judges on a prior dataset and the new ConQRet benchmark. Our proposed LLM Judges and the ConQRet benchmark can enable rapid progress in computational argumentation and can be naturally extended to other complex retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

### Are Frontier Large Language Models Suitable for Q&A in Science Centres?
**Authors**: Jacob Watson, Fabrício Góes, Marco Volpe, Talles Medeiros

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:28:43Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the suitability of frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) for Q&A interactions in science centres, with the aim of boosting visitor engagement while maintaining factual accuracy. Using a dataset of questions collected from the National Space Centre in Leicester (UK), we evaluated responses generated by three leading models: OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini 1.5. Each model was prompted for both standard and creative responses tailored to an 8-year-old audience, and these responses were assessed by space science experts based on accuracy, engagement, clarity, novelty, and deviation from expected answers. The results revealed a trade-off between creativity and accuracy, with Claude outperforming GPT and Gemini in both maintaining clarity and engaging young audiences, even when asked to generate more creative responses. Nonetheless, experts observed that higher novelty was generally associated with reduced factual reliability across all models. This study highlights the potential of LLMs in educational settings, emphasizing the need for careful prompt engineering to balance engagement with scientific rigor.

### Is Your Paper Being Reviewed by an LLM? Investigating AI Text   Detectability in Peer Review
**Authors**: Sungduk Yu, Man Luo, Avinash Madasu, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:23:53Z

**Summary**: Peer review is a critical process for ensuring the integrity of published scientific research. Confidence in this process is predicated on the assumption that experts in the relevant domain give careful consideration to the merits of manuscripts which are submitted for publication. With the recent rapid advancements in the linguistic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a new potential risk to the peer review process is that negligent reviewers will rely on LLMs to perform the often time consuming process of reviewing a paper. In this study, we investigate the ability of existing AI text detection algorithms to distinguish between peer reviews written by humans and different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that existing approaches fail to identify many GPT-4o written reviews without also producing a high number of false positive classifications. To address this deficiency, we propose a new detection approach which surpasses existing methods in the identification of GPT-4o written peer reviews at low levels of false positive classifications. Our work reveals the difficulty of accurately identifying AI-generated text at the individual review level, highlighting the urgent need for new tools and methods to detect this type of unethical application of generative AI.

### SurgBox: Agent-Driven Operating Room Sandbox with Surgery Copilot
**Authors**: Jinlin Wu, Xusheng Liang, Xuexue Bai, Zhen Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:07:27Z

**Summary**: Surgical interventions, particularly in neurology, represent complex and high-stakes scenarios that impose substantial cognitive burdens on surgical teams. Although deliberate education and practice can enhance cognitive capabilities, surgical training opportunities remain limited due to patient safety concerns. To address these cognitive challenges in surgical training and operation, we propose SurgBox, an agent-driven sandbox framework to systematically enhance the cognitive capabilities of surgeons in immersive surgical simulations. Specifically, our SurgBox leverages large language models (LLMs) with tailored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to authentically replicate various surgical roles, enabling realistic training environments for deliberate practice. In particular, we devise Surgery Copilot, an AI-driven assistant to actively coordinate the surgical information stream and support clinical decision-making, thereby diminishing the cognitive workload of surgical teams during surgery. By incorporating a novel Long-Short Memory mechanism, our Surgery Copilot can effectively balance immediate procedural assistance with comprehensive surgical knowledge. Extensive experiments using real neurosurgical procedure records validate our SurgBox framework in both enhancing surgical cognitive capabilities and supporting clinical decision-making. By providing an integrated solution for training and operational support to address cognitive challenges, our SurgBox framework advances surgical education and practice, potentially transforming surgical outcomes and healthcare quality. The code is available at https://github.com/franciszchen/SurgBox.

### LinVT: Empower Your Image-level Large Language Model to Understand   Videos
**Authors**: Lishuai Gao, Yujie Zhong, Yingsen Zeng, Haoxian Tan, Dengjie Li, Zheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:04:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in various tasks, motivating us to develop an LLM-based assistant for videos. Instead of training from scratch, we propose a module to transform arbitrary well-trained image-based LLMs into video-LLMs (after being trained on video data). To better adapt image-LLMs for processing videos, we introduce two design principles: linear transformation to preserve the original visual-language alignment and representative information condensation from redundant video content. Guided by these principles, we propose a plug-and-play Linear Video Tokenizer(LinVT), which enables existing image-LLMs to understand videos. We benchmark LinVT with six recent visual LLMs: Aquila, Blip-3, InternVL2, Mipha, Molmo and Qwen2-VL, showcasing the high compatibility of LinVT. LinVT-based LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, illustrating the effectiveness of LinVT in multi-modal video understanding.

### QueEn: A Large Language Model for Quechua-English Translation
**Authors**: Junhao Chen, Peng Shu, Yiwei Li, Huaqin Zhao, Hanqi Jiang, Yi Pan, Yifan Zhou, Zhengliang Liu, Lewis C Howe, Tianming Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:04:21Z

**Summary**: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for working with natural language, bringing advances in many areas of computational linguistics. However, these models face challenges when applied to low-resource languages due to limited training data and difficulty in understanding cultural nuances. In this paper, we propose QueEn, a novel approach for Quechua-English translation that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Our method leverages external linguistic resources through RAG and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient model adaptation. Experimental results show that our approach substantially exceeds baseline models, with a BLEU score of 17.6 compared to 1.5 for standard GPT models. The integration of RAG with fine-tuning allows our system to address the challenges of low-resource language translation while maintaining computational efficiency. This work contributes to the broader goal of preserving endangered languages through advanced language technologies.

### WAPITI: A Watermark for Finetuned Open-Source LLMs
**Authors**: Lingjie Chen, Ruizhong Qiu, Siyu Yuan, Zhining Liu, Tianxin Wei, Hyunsik Yoo, Zhichen Zeng, Deqing Yang, Hanghang Tong

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:50:13Z

**Summary**: Watermarking of large language models (LLMs) generation embeds an imperceptible statistical pattern within texts, making it algorithmically detectable. Watermarking is a promising method for addressing potential harm and biases from LLMs, as it enables traceability, accountability, and detection of manipulated content, helping to mitigate unintended consequences. However, for open-source models, watermarking faces two major challenges: (i) incompatibility with fine-tuned models, and (ii) vulnerability to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we propose WAPITI, a new method that transfers watermarking from base models to fine-tuned models through parameter integration. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first watermark for fine-tuned open-source LLMs that preserves their fine-tuned capabilities. Furthermore, our approach offers an effective defense against fine-tuning attacks. We test our method on various model architectures and watermarking strategies. Results demonstrate that our method can successfully inject watermarks and is highly compatible with fine-tuned models. Additionally, we offer an in-depth analysis of how parameter editing influences the watermark strength and overall capabilities of the resulting models.

**Authors**: Youquan Xian, Xueying Zeng, Duancheng Xuan, Danping Yang, Chunpei Li, Peng Fan, Peng Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:43:58Z

**Summary**: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.

**Authors**: Margaux Tornqvist, Jean-Daniel Zucker, Tristan Fauvel, Nicolas Lambert, Mathilde Berthelot, Antoine Movschin

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:10:40Z

**Summary**: Access to large-scale high-quality healthcare databases is key to accelerate medical research and make insightful discoveries about diseases. However, access to such data is often limited by patient privacy concerns, data sharing restrictions and high costs. To overcome these limitations, synthetic patient data has emerged as an alternative. However, synthetic data generation (SDG) methods typically rely on machine learning (ML) models trained on original data, leading back to the data scarcity problem. We propose an approach to generate synthetic tabular patient data that does not require access to the original data, but only a description of the desired database. We leverage prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic patient data, even in a low-resource setting. We quantitatively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art SDG models, using fidelity, privacy, and utility metrics. Our results show that while LLMs may not match the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on the original data, they effectively generate realistic patient data with well-preserved clinical correlations. An ablation study highlights key elements of our prompt contributing to high-quality synthetic patient data generation. This approach, which is easy to use and does not require original data or advanced ML skills, is particularly valuable for quickly generating custom-designed patient data, supporting project implementation and providing educational resources.

### Explingo: Explaining AI Predictions using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Alexandra Zytek, Sara Pido, Sarah Alnegheimish, Laure Berti-Equille, Kalyan Veeramachaneni

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T16:01:30Z

**Summary**: Explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions generated by Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP are essential for people using ML outputs for decision-making. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform these explanations into human-readable, narrative formats that align with natural communication. We address two key research questions: (1) Can LLMs reliably transform traditional explanations into high-quality narratives? and (2) How can we effectively evaluate the quality of narrative explanations? To answer these questions, we introduce Explingo, which consists of two LLM-based subsystems, a Narrator and Grader. The Narrator takes in ML explanations and transforms them into natural-language descriptions. The Grader scores these narratives on a set of metrics including accuracy, completeness, fluency, and conciseness.   Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate high-quality narratives that achieve high scores across all metrics, particularly when guided by a small number of human-labeled and bootstrapped examples. We also identified areas that remain challenging, in particular for effectively scoring narratives in complex domains. The findings from this work have been integrated into an open-source tool that makes narrative explanations available for further applications.

### Can Large Language Models Serve as Effective Classifiers for   Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Documents at Industrial   Scale?
**Authors**: Seyed Amin Tabatabaei, Sarah Fancher, Michael Parsons, Arian Askari

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:51:22Z

**Summary**: We address the task of hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) of scientific documents at an industrial scale, where hundreds of thousands of documents must be classified across thousands of dynamic labels. The rapid growth of scientific publications necessitates scalable and efficient methods for classification, further complicated by the evolving nature of taxonomies--where new categories are introduced, existing ones are merged, and outdated ones are deprecated. Traditional machine learning approaches, which require costly retraining with each taxonomy update, become impractical due to the high overhead of labelled data collection and model adaptation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex tasks such as multi-label classification. However, applying them to large and dynamic taxonomies presents unique challenges as the vast number of labels can exceed LLMs' input limits. In this paper, we present novel methods that combine the strengths of LLMs with dense retrieval techniques to overcome these challenges. Our approach avoids retraining by leveraging zero-shot HMC for real-time label assignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on SSRN, a large repository of preprints spanning multiple disciplines, and demonstrate significant improvements in both classification accuracy and cost-efficiency. By developing a tailored evaluation framework for dynamic taxonomies and publicly releasing our code, this research provides critical insights into applying LLMs for document classification, where the number of classes corresponds to the number of nodes in a large taxonomy, at an industrial scale.

### xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory
**Authors**: Maximilian Beck, Korbinian Pöppel, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, Günter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:42:07Z

**Summary**: In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

### The Prompt Canvas: A Literature-Based Practitioner Guide for Creating   Effective Prompts in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Michael Hewing, Vincent Leinhos

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T15:35:18Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of prompt engineering as a crucial technique for optimizing model outputs. While experimentation with various prompting methods, such as Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and role-based techniques, has yielded promising results, these advancements remain fragmented across academic papers, blog posts and anecdotal experimentation. The lack of a single, unified resource to consolidate the field's knowledge impedes the progress of both research and practical application. This paper argues for the creation of an overarching framework that synthesizes existing methodologies into a cohesive overview for practitioners. Using a design-based research approach, we present the Prompt Canvas, a structured framework resulting from an extensive literature review on prompt engineering that captures current knowledge and expertise. By combining the conceptual foundations and practical strategies identified in prompt engineering, the Prompt Canvas provides a practical approach for leveraging the potential of Large Language Models. It is primarily designed as a learning resource for pupils, students and employees, offering a structured introduction to prompt engineering. This work aims to contribute to the growing discourse on prompt engineering by establishing a unified methodology for researchers and providing guidance for practitioners.

### From Defects to Demands: A Unified, Iterative, and Heuristically Guided   LLM-Based Framework for Automated Software Repair and Requirement Realization
**Authors**: Alex, Liu, Vivian, Chi

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:54:21Z

**Summary**: This manuscript signals a new era in the integration of artificial intelligence with software engineering, placing machines at the pinnacle of coding capability. We present a formalized, iterative methodology proving that AI can fully replace human programmers in all aspects of code creation and refinement. Our approach, combining large language models with formal verification, test-driven development, and incremental architectural guidance, achieves a 38.6% improvement over the current top performer's 48.33% accuracy on the SWE-bench benchmark. This surpasses previously assumed limits, signaling the end of human-exclusive coding and the rise of autonomous AI-driven software innovation. More than a technical advance, our work challenges centuries-old assumptions about human creativity. We provide robust evidence of AI superiority, demonstrating tangible gains in practical engineering contexts and laying the foundation for a future in which computational creativity outpaces human ingenuity.

### Sense and Sensitivity: Evaluating the simulation of social dynamics via   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Da Ju, Adina Williams, Brian Karrer, Maximilian Nickel

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:50:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models have increasingly been proposed as a powerful replacement for classical agent-based models (ABMs) to simulate social dynamics. By using LLMs as a proxy for human behavior, the hope of this new approach is to be able to simulate significantly more complex dynamics than with classical ABMs and gain new insights in fields such as social science, political science, and economics. However, due to the black box nature of LLMs, it is unclear whether LLM agents actually execute the intended semantics that are encoded in their natural language instructions and, if the resulting dynamics of interactions are meaningful. To study this question, we propose a new evaluation framework that grounds LLM simulations within the dynamics of established reference models of social science. By treating LLMs as a black-box function, we evaluate their input-output behavior relative to this reference model, which allows us to evaluate detailed aspects of their behavior. Our results show that, while it is possible to engineer prompts that approximate the intended dynamics, the quality of these simulations is highly sensitive to the particular choice of prompts. Importantly, simulations are even sensitive to arbitrary variations such as minor wording changes and whitespace. This puts into question the usefulness of current versions of LLMs for meaningful simulations, as without a reference model, it is impossible to determine a priori what impact seemingly meaningless changes in prompt will have on the simulation.

### Towards the interoperability of low-code platforms
**Authors**: Iván Alfonso, Aaron Conrardy, Jordi Cabot

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:33:34Z

**Summary**: With the promise of accelerating software development, low-code platforms (LCPs) are becoming popular across various industries. Nevertheless, there are still barriers hindering their adoption. Among them, vendor lock-in is a major concern, especially considering the lack of interoperability between these platforms. Typically, after modeling an application in one LCP, migrating to another requires starting from scratch remodeling everything (the data model, the graphical user interface, workflows, etc.), in the new platform.   To overcome this situation, this work proposes an approach to improve the interoperability of LCPs by (semi)automatically migrating models specified in one platform to another one. The concrete migration path depends on the capabilities of the source and target tools. We first analyze popular LCPs, characterize their import and export alternatives and define transformations between those data formats when available. This is then complemented with an LLM-based solution, where image recognition features of large language models are employed to migrate models based on a simple image export of the model at hand. The full pipelines are implemented on top of the BESSER modeling framework that acts as a pivot representation between the tools.

### MultiTrust: A Comprehensive Benchmark Towards Trustworthy Multimodal   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yichi Zhang, Yao Huang, Yitong Sun, Chang Liu, Zhe Zhao, Zhengwei Fang, Yifan Wang, Huanran Chen, Xiao Yang, Xingxing Wei, Hang Su, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T14:21:06Z

**Summary**: Despite the superior capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, they still face significant trustworthiness challenges. Yet, current literature on the assessment of trustworthy MLLMs remains limited, lacking a holistic evaluation to offer thorough insights into future improvements. In this work, we establish MultiTrust, the first comprehensive and unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary aspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Our benchmark employs a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets. Extensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored trustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by the multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to enhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still struggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to disclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when paired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality amplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to facilitate future advancements in this important field. Code and resources are publicly available at: https://multi-trust.github.io/.

### Level Up or Game Over: Exploring How Dark Patterns Shape Mobile Games
**Authors**: Sam Niknejad, Thomas Mildner, Nima Zargham, Susanne Putze, Rainer Malaka

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:45:27Z

**Summary**: This study explores the prevalence of dark patterns in mobile games that exploit players through temporal, monetary, social, and psychological means. Recognizing the ethical concerns and potential harm surrounding these manipulative strategies, we analyze user-generated data of 1496 games to identify relationships between the deployment of dark patterns within "dark" and "healthy" games. Our findings reveal that dark patterns are not only widespread in games typically seen as problematic but are also present in games that may be perceived as benign. This research contributes needed quantitative support to the broader understanding of dark patterns in games. With an emphasis on ethical design, our study highlights current problems of revenue models that can be particularly harmful to vulnerable populations. To this end, we discuss the relevance of community-based approaches to surface harmful design and the necessity for collaboration among players/users and practitioners to promote healthier gaming experiences.

### Sensitive Content Classification in Social Media: A Holistic Resource   and Evaluation
**Authors**: Dimosthenis Antypas, Indira Sen, Carla Perez-Almendros, Jose Camacho-Collados, Francesco Barbieri

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:41:53Z

**Summary**: The detection of sensitive content in large datasets is crucial for ensuring that shared and analysed data is free from harmful material. However, current moderation tools, such as external APIs, suffer from limitations in customisation, accuracy across diverse sensitive categories, and privacy concerns. Additionally, existing datasets and open-source models focus predominantly on toxic language, leaving gaps in detecting other sensitive categories such as substance abuse or self-harm. In this paper, we put forward a unified dataset tailored for social media content moderation across six sensitive categories: conflictual language, profanity, sexually explicit material, drug-related content, self-harm, and spam. By collecting and annotating data with consistent retrieval strategies and guidelines, we address the shortcomings of previous focalised research. Our analysis demonstrates that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on this novel dataset yields significant improvements in detection performance compared to open off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA, and even proprietary OpenAI models, which underperform by 10-15% overall. This limitation is even more pronounced on popular moderation APIs, which cannot be easily tailored to specific sensitive content categories, among others.

### LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation
**Authors**: Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:35:45Z

**Summary**: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T13:20:57Z

**Summary**: Few shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting have shown promise when applied to Physics Question Answering Tasks, but are limited by the lack of mathematical ability inherent to LLMs, and are prone to hallucination. By utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model, along with analogical prompting, we are able to show improved model performance when compared to the baseline on standard LLMs. We also survey the limits of these prompting techniques and the effects they have on model performance. Additionally, we propose Analogical CoT prompting, a prompting technique designed to allow smaller, open source models to leverage Analogical prompting, something they have struggled with, possibly due to a lack of specialist training data.

### LLM-Enhanced Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Analog Layout   Constraint Generation
**Authors**: Guojin Chen, Keren Zhu, Seunggeun Kim, Hanqing Zhu, Yao Lai, Bei Yu, David Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:40:53Z

**Summary**: Analog layout synthesis faces significant challenges due to its dependence on manual processes, considerable time requirements, and performance instability. Current Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based techniques for analog layout synthesis, despite their potential for automation, suffer from slow convergence and extensive data needs, limiting their practical application. This paper presents the \texttt{LLANA} framework, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance BO by exploiting the few-shot learning abilities of LLMs for more efficient generation of analog design-dependent parameter constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{LLANA} not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) BO methods but also enables a more effective exploration of the analog circuit design space, thanks to LLM's superior contextual understanding and learning efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/dekura/LLANA.

### Hallucination Detection in LLMs: Fast and Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuned   Models
**Authors**: Gabriel Y. Arteaga, Thomas B. Schön, Nicolas Pielawski

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:39:00Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work, we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.

### Power Plant Detection for Energy Estimation using GIS with Remote   Sensing, CNN & Vision Transformers
**Authors**: Blessing Austin-Gabriel, Cristian Noriega Monsalve, Aparna S. Varde

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:15:11Z

**Summary**: In this research, we propose a hybrid model for power plant detection to assist energy estimation applications, by pipelining GIS (Geographical Information Systems) having Remote Sensing capabilities with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and ViT (Vision Transformers). Our proposed approach enables real-time analysis with multiple data types on a common map via the GIS, entails feature-extraction abilities due to the CNN, and captures long-range dependencies through the ViT. This hybrid approach is found to enhance classification, thus helping in the monitoring and operational management of power plants; hence assisting energy estimation and sustainable energy planning in the future. It exemplifies adequate deployment of machine learning methods in conjunction with domain-specific approaches to enhance performance.

### Towards Boosting LLMs-driven Relevance Modeling with Progressive   Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting
**Authors**: Zeyuan Chen, Haiyan Wu, Kaixin Wu, Wei Chen, Mingjie Zhong, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T12:09:15Z

**Summary**: Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries. Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance. However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation. Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective. To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs. In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations. Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.

### LLMs May Perform MCQA by Selecting the Least Incorrect Option
**Authors**: Haochun Wang, Sendong Zhao, Zewen Qiang, Nuwa Xi, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:54:40Z

**Summary**: In the field of NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced performance across a variety of tasks. However, the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs remains an inevitable challenge for the community. Recently, the adoption of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) as a benchmark for assessing LLMs has gained considerable traction. However, concerns regarding the robustness of this evaluative method persist. Building upon previous discussions on the issue of \textit{variability}, we reveal an additional dimension of concern: LLMs may perform MCQA by selecting the least incorrect option rather than distinctly correct. This observation suggests that LLMs might regard multiple options as correct, which could undermine the reliability of MCQA as a metric for evaluating LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce an enhanced dataset augmentation method for MCQA, termed MCQA+, to provide a more accurate reflection of the model performance, thereby highlighting the necessity for more sophisticated evaluation mechanisms in the assessment of LLM capabilities.

**Authors**: Allard Oelen, Mohamad Yaser Jaradeh, Sören Auer

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:53:57Z

**Summary**: Purpose: Finding scholarly articles is a time-consuming and cumbersome activity, yet crucial for conducting science. Due to the growing number of scholarly articles, new scholarly search systems are needed to effectively assist researchers in finding relevant literature.   Methodology: We take a neuro-symbolic approach to scholarly search and exploration by leveraging state-of-the-art components, including semantic search, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The semantic search component composes a set of relevant articles. From this set of articles, information is extracted and presented to the user.   Findings: The presented system, called ORKG ASK (Assistant for Scientific Knowledge), provides a production-ready search and exploration system.

**Authors**: Shangning Xia, Hongjie Fang, Cewu Lu, Hao-Shu Fang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:39:35Z

**Summary**: Generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly when scaling to new environments with limited demonstrations. This paper introduces CAGE, a novel robotic manipulation policy designed to overcome these generalization barriers by integrating a causal attention mechanism. CAGE utilizes the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the vision foundation model DINOv2, combined with LoRA fine-tuning for robust environment understanding. The policy further employs a causal Perceiver for effective token compression and a diffusion-based action prediction head with attention mechanisms to enhance task-specific fine-grained conditioning. With as few as 50 demonstrations from a single training environment, CAGE achieves robust generalization across diverse visual changes in objects, backgrounds, and viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate that CAGE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art RGB/RGB-D approaches in various manipulation tasks, especially under large distribution shifts. In similar environments, CAGE offers an average of 42% increase in task completion rate. While all baselines fail to execute the task in unseen environments, CAGE manages to obtain a 43% completion rate and a 51% success rate in average, making a huge step towards practical deployment of robots in real-world settings.

### Densing Law of LLMs
**Authors**: Chaojun Xiao, Jie Cai, Weilin Zhao, Guoyang Zeng, Biyuan Lin, Jie Zhou, Zhi Zheng, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:39:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.

### Flash Communication: Reducing Tensor Parallelization Bottleneck for Fast   Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Qingyuan Li, Bo Zhang, Liang Ye, Yifan Zhang, Wei Wu, Yerui Sun, Lin Ma, Yuchen Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:29:32Z

**Summary**: The ever-increasing sizes of large language models necessitate distributed solutions for fast inference that exploit multi-dimensional parallelism, where computational loads are split across various accelerators such as GPU clusters. However, this approach often introduces significant communication overhead, especially on devices with limited bandwidth. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Flash Communication}, a novel low-bit compression technique designed to alleviate the tensor-parallelism communication bottleneck during inference. Our method substantially boosts intra-node communication speed by more than 3x and reduces the \emph{time-to-first-token} by 2x, with nearly no sacrifice in model accuracy. Extensive experiments on various up-to-date LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### NitroFusion: High-Fidelity Single-Step Diffusion through Dynamic   Adversarial Training
**Authors**: Dar-Yen Chen, Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Kai Zou, Yi-Zhe Song

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:22:17Z

**Summary**: We introduce NitroFusion, a fundamentally different approach to single-step diffusion that achieves high-quality generation through a dynamic adversarial framework. While one-step methods offer dramatic speed advantages, they typically suffer from quality degradation compared to their multi-step counterparts. Just as a panel of art critics provides comprehensive feedback by specializing in different aspects like composition, color, and technique, our approach maintains a large pool of specialized discriminator heads that collectively guide the generation process. Each discriminator group develops expertise in specific quality aspects at different noise levels, providing diverse feedback that enables high-fidelity one-step generation. Our framework combines: (i) a dynamic discriminator pool with specialized discriminator groups to improve generation quality, (ii) strategic refresh mechanisms to prevent discriminator overfitting, and (iii) global-local discriminator heads for multi-scale quality assessment, and unconditional/conditional training for balanced generation. Additionally, our framework uniquely supports flexible deployment through bottom-up refinement, allowing users to dynamically choose between 1-4 denoising steps with the same model for direct quality-speed trade-offs. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NitroFusion significantly outperforms existing single-step methods across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly excelling in preserving fine details and global consistency.

### Gla-AI4BioMed at RRG24: Visual Instruction-tuned Adaptation for   Radiology Report Generation
**Authors**: Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:14:03Z

**Summary**: We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. This integration enhances the ability of model to understand and describe chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy. The training process involves a two-stage approach: (i) initial alignment of chest X-ray features with the LLM (ii) followed by fine-tuning for radiology report generation.

### KaLM: Knowledge-aligned Autoregressive Language Modeling via Dual-view   Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Peng Yu, Cheng Deng, Beiya Dai, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:08:24Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:07:44Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise, yet their evaluation raises concerns, particularly regarding data contamination due to the lack of access to proprietary training data. To address this issue, we present C$^2$LEVA, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark featuring systematic contamination prevention. C$^2$LEVA firstly offers a holistic evaluation encompassing 22 tasks, each targeting a specific application or ability of LLMs, and secondly a trustworthy assessment due to our contamination-free tasks, ensured by a systematic contamination prevention strategy that fully automates test data renewal and enforces data protection during benchmark data release. Our large-scale evaluation of 15 open-source and proprietary models demonstrates the effectiveness of C$^2$LEVA.

### I Dream My Painting: Connecting MLLMs and Diffusion Models via Prompt   Generation for Text-Guided Multi-Mask Inpainting
**Authors**: Nicola Fanelli, Gennaro Vessio, Giovanna Castellano

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:58:53Z

**Summary**: Inpainting focuses on filling missing or corrupted regions of an image to blend seamlessly with its surrounding content and style. While conditional diffusion models have proven effective for text-guided inpainting, we introduce the novel task of multi-mask inpainting, where multiple regions are simultaneously inpainted using distinct prompts. Furthermore, we design a fine-tuning procedure for multimodal LLMs, such as LLaVA, to generate multi-mask prompts automatically using corrupted images as inputs. These models can generate helpful and detailed prompt suggestions for filling the masked regions. The generated prompts are then fed to Stable Diffusion, which is fine-tuned for the multi-mask inpainting problem using rectified cross-attention, enforcing prompts onto their designated regions for filling. Experiments on digitized paintings from WikiArt and the Densely Captioned Images dataset demonstrate that our pipeline delivers creative and accurate inpainting results. Our code, data, and trained models are available at https://cilabuniba.github.io/i-dream-my-painting.

### Who Speaks Next? Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of   Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games
**Authors**: Ryota Nonomura, Hiroki Mori

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:45:54Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.

### Endless Jailbreaks with Bijection Learning
**Authors**: Brian R. Y. Huang, Maximilian Li, Leonard Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:31:43Z

**Summary**: Despite extensive safety measures, LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, or jailbreaks, which can elicit unsafe behaviors. In this work, we introduce bijection learning, a powerful attack algorithm which automatically fuzzes LLMs for safety vulnerabilities using randomly-generated encodings whose complexity can be tightly controlled. We leverage in-context learning to teach models bijective encodings, pass encoded queries to the model to bypass built-in safety mechanisms, and finally decode responses back into English. Our attack is extremely effective on a wide range of frontier language models. Moreover, by controlling complexity parameters such as number of key-value mappings in the encodings, we find a close relationship between the capability level of the attacked LLM and the average complexity of the most effective bijection attacks. Our work highlights that new vulnerabilities in frontier models can emerge with scale: more capable models are more severely jailbroken by bijection attacks.

### Enhancing Zero-shot Chain of Thought Prompting via Uncertainty-Guided   Strategy Selection
**Authors**: Shanu Kumar, Saish Mendke, Karody Lubna Abdul Rahman, Santosh Kurasa, Parag Agrawal, Sandipan Dandapat

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:24:47Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the capability of large language models (LLMs) by structuring their reasoning processes. However, existing methods face critical limitations: handcrafted demonstrations require extensive human expertise, while trigger phrases are prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose the Zero-shot Uncertainty-based Selection (ZEUS) method, a novel approach that improves CoT prompting by utilizing uncertainty estimates to select effective demonstrations without needing access to model parameters. Unlike traditional methods, ZEUS offers high sensitivity in distinguishing between helpful and ineffective questions, ensuring more precise and reliable selection. Our extensive evaluation shows that ZEUS consistently outperforms existing CoT strategies across four challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.

**Authors**: Thevin Senath, Kumuthu Athukorala, Ransika Costa, Surangika Ranathunga, Rishemjit Kaur

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:21:25Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of recipe personalization through ingredient substitution. We make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an ingredient substitution system designed to predict plausible substitute ingredients within a given recipe context. Given that the use of LLMs for this task has been barely done, we carry out an extensive set of experiments to determine the best LLM, prompt, and the fine-tuning setups. We further experiment with methods such as multi-task learning, two-stage fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The experiments are conducted using the publicly available Recipe1MSub corpus. The best results are produced by the Mistral7-Base LLM after fine-tuning and DPO. This result outperforms the strong baseline available for the same corpus with a Hit@1 score of 22.04. Thus we believe that this research represents a significant step towards enabling personalized and creative culinary experiences by utilizing LLM-based ingredient substitution.

### Continuous Speech Tokens Makes LLMs Robust Multi-Modality Learners
**Authors**: Ze Yuan, Yanqing Liu, Shujie Liu, Sheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:16:04Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in GPT-4o like multi-modality models have demonstrated remarkable progress for direct speech-to-speech conversation, with real-time speech interaction experience and strong speech understanding ability. However, current research focuses on discrete speech tokens to align with discrete text tokens for language modelling, which depends on an audio codec with residual connections or independent group tokens, such a codec usually leverages large scale and diverse datasets training to ensure that the discrete speech codes have good representation for varied domain, noise, style data reconstruction as well as a well-designed codec quantizer and encoder-decoder architecture for discrete token language modelling. This paper introduces Flow-Omni, a continuous speech token based GPT-4o like model, capable of real-time speech interaction and low streaming latency. Specifically, first, instead of cross-entropy loss only, we combine flow matching loss with a pretrained autoregressive LLM and a small MLP network to predict the probability distribution of the continuous-valued speech tokens from speech prompt. second, we incorporated the continuous speech tokens to Flow-Omni multi-modality training, thereby achieving robust speech-to-speech performance with discrete text tokens and continuous speech tokens together. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to discrete text and speech multi-modality training and its variants, the continuous speech tokens mitigate robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of discrete speech code's representation loss for LLM.

**Authors**: Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T10:01:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes of human-machine interaction, leading to the accumulation of vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. A conversational life-cycle spans from the Prelude through the Interlocution to the Epilogue, encompassing various elements. Despite the existence of numerous dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmarks that encompass comprehensive dialogue elements, hindering precise modeling and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. Inspired by imitation learning, we further build the agent which possesses the adept ability to model dialogue elements based on the DEMO benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that existing LLMs still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent has superior performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

### EACO: Enhancing Alignment in Multimodal LLMs via Critical Observation
**Authors**: Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:59:47Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.

### Benchmarking Neural Radiance Fields for Autonomous Robots: An Overview
**Authors**: Yuhang Ming, Xingrui Yang, Weihan Wang, Zheng Chen, Jinglun Feng, Yifan Xing, Guofeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:34:43Z

**Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D scene representation, offering high-fidelity renderings and reconstructions from a set of sparse and unstructured sensor data. In the context of autonomous robotics, where perception and understanding of the environment are pivotal, NeRF holds immense promise for improving performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for utilizing NeRF to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots. We especially focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous operation, including 3D reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and planning, and interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we explore promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. Notably, we discuss the integration of advanced techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), large language models (LLM), and generative AIs, envisioning enhanced reconstruction efficiency, scene understanding, decision-making capabilities. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRFs to empower autonomous robots, paving the way for innovative solutions that can navigate and interact seamlessly in complex environments.

### Autoformalize Mathematical Statements by Symbolic Equivalence and   Semantic Consistency
**Authors**: Zenan Li, Yifan Wu, Zhaoyu Li, Xinming Wei, Xian Zhang, Fan Yang, Xiaoxing Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:06:20Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization, the task of automatically translating natural language descriptions into a formal language, poses a significant challenge across various domains, especially in mathematics. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unveiled their promising capabilities to formalize even competition-level math problems. However, we observe a considerable discrepancy between pass@1 and pass@k accuracies in LLM-generated formalizations. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework that scores and selects the best result from k autoformalization candidates based on two complementary self-consistency methods: symbolic equivalence and semantic consistency. Elaborately, symbolic equivalence identifies the logical homogeneity among autoformalization candidates using automated theorem provers, and semantic consistency evaluates the preservation of the original meaning by informalizing the candidates and computing the similarity between the embeddings of the original and informalized texts. Our extensive experiments on the MATH and miniF2F datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances autoformalization accuracy, achieving up to 0.22-1.35x relative improvements across various LLMs and baseline methods.

### COBias and Debias: Minimizing Language Model Pairwise Accuracy Bias via   Nonlinear Integer Programming
**Authors**: Ruixi Lin, Yang You

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:04:55Z

**Summary**: When performing classification tasks with language models, would you prefer having only one highly accurate class or having every class deliver reliable performance? Obviously, a more balanced accuracy among classes better reflects the expectations of the majority of users. Especially for large language models (LLMs), the fact that they achieve a fair overall accuracy by in-context learning (ICL) obscures a large difference in individual class accuracies. In this work, we uncover and tackle language models' imbalance in per-class prediction accuracy by reconceptualizing it as the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), and we are the first to engage nonlinear integer programming (NIP) to debias it. Briefly, the proposed COBias metric measures accuracy differences among class pairs, with which we reveal the large per-class accuracy differences exhibited in LLMs of varied scales and families. Then we propose Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) to correct ICL per-class probabilities towards lower COBias and higher overall accuracy. Our optimization objective is directly based on the evaluation scores by COBias and accuracy metrics, which is non-differentiable and solved by the simulated annealing metaheuristic. Evaluations on three LLMs across seven NLP classification tasks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves significant COBias reduction (-27%) and accuracy improvement (+12%) over the conventional ICL approach, suggesting that modeling pairwise class accuracy differences is a direction in pushing forward more accurate, more reliable LLM predictions.

### Building a Family of Data Augmentation Models for Low-cost LLM   Fine-tuning on the Cloud
**Authors**: Yuanhao Yue, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Peng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T09:04:12Z

**Summary**: Specializing LLMs in various domain-specific tasks has emerged as a critical step towards achieving high performance. However, the construction and annotation of datasets in specific domains are always very costly. Apart from using superior and expensive closed-source LLM APIs to construct datasets, some open-source models have become strong enough to handle dataset construction in many scenarios. Thus, we present a family of data augmentation models designed to significantly improve the efficiency for model fine-tuning. These models, trained based on sufficiently small LLMs, support key functionalities with low inference costs: instruction expansion, instruction refinement, and instruction-response pair expansion. To fulfill this goal, we first construct an automatic data collection system with seed datasets generated from both public repositories and our in-house datasets. This system leverages powerful LLMs to expand, refine and re-write the instructions and responses, incorporating quality assessment techniques. Following this, we introduce the training process of our models, which effectively distills task-solving and text synthesis abilities from teacher LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate how we integrate these functionalities into a machine learning platform to support low-cost LLM fine-tuning from both dataset preparation and training perspectives for users. Experiments and an application study prove the effectiveness of our approach.

**Authors**: Rajat Rawat, Hudson McBride, Dhiyaan Nirmal, Rajarshi Ghosh, Jong Moon, Dhruv Alamuri, Sean O'Brien, Kevin Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:53:43Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) gain traction in healthcare, concerns about their susceptibility to demographic biases are growing. We introduce {DiversityMedQA}, a novel benchmark designed to assess LLM responses to medical queries across diverse patient demographics, such as gender and ethnicity. By perturbing questions from the MedQA dataset, which comprises medical board exam questions, we created a benchmark that captures the nuanced differences in medical diagnosis across varying patient profiles. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies in model performance when tested against these demographic variations. Furthermore, to ensure the perturbations were accurate, we also propose a filtering strategy that validates each perturbation. By releasing DiversityMedQA, we provide a resource for evaluating and mitigating demographic bias in LLM medical diagnoses.

### Breaking Event Rumor Detection via Stance-Separated Multi-Agent Debate
**Authors**: Mingqing Zhang, Haisong Gong, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:52:30Z

**Summary**: The rapid spread of rumors on social media platforms during breaking events severely hinders the dissemination of the truth. Previous studies reveal that the lack of annotated resources hinders the direct detection of unforeseen breaking events not covered in yesterday's news. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for rumor detection holds significant promise. However, it is challenging for LLMs to provide comprehensive responses to complex or controversial issues due to limited diversity. In this work, we propose the Stance Separated Multi-Agent Debate (S2MAD) to address this issue. Specifically, we firstly introduce Stance Separation, categorizing comments as either supporting or opposing the original claim. Subsequently, claims are classified as subjective or objective, enabling agents to generate reasonable initial viewpoints with different prompt strategies for each type of claim. Debaters then follow specific instructions through multiple rounds of debate to reach a consensus. If a consensus is not reached, a judge agent evaluates the opinions and delivers a final verdict on the claim's veracity. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and effectively improves the performance of LLMs in breaking event rumor detection.

**Summary**: A critical question about Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether their apparent deficiency in mathematical reasoning is inherent, or merely a result of insufficient exposure to high-quality mathematical data. To explore this, we developed an automated method for generating high-quality, supervised mathematical datasets. The method carefully mutates existing math problems, ensuring both diversity and validity of the newly generated problems. This is achieved by a neuro-symbolic data generation framework combining the intuitive informalization strengths of LLMs, and the precise symbolic reasoning of math solvers along with projected Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in the highly-irregular symbolic space. Empirical experiments demonstrate the high quality of data generated by the proposed method, and that the LLMs, specifically LLaMA-2 and Mistral, when realigned with the generated data, surpass their state-of-the-art counterparts.

### Can Large Language Models Effectively Process and Execute Financial   Trading Instructions?
**Authors**: Yu Kang, Ge Wang, Xin Yang, Yuda Wang, Mingwen Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:48:49Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created transformative opportunities for the financial industry, especially in the area of financial trading. However, how to integrate LLMs with trading systems has become a challenge. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent trade order recognition pipeline that enables the conversion of trade orders into a standard format in trade execution. The system improves the ability of human traders to interact with trading platforms while addressing the problem of misinformation acquisition in trade execution. In addition, we have created a trade order dataset of 500 pieces of data to simulate real-world trading scenarios. Moreover, we designed several metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset reliability and the generative power of big models in finance by experimenting with five state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset. The results indicate that while LLMs demonstrate high generation rates (87.50% to 98.33%) and perfect follow-up rates, they face significant challenges in accuracy (5% to 10%) and completeness, with high missing rates (14.29% to 67.29%). In addition, LLMs tend to over-interrogate, suggesting that large models tend to collect more information, carrying certain challenges for information security.

### PropertyGPT: LLM-driven Formal Verification of Smart Contracts through   Retrieval-Augmented Property Generation
**Authors**: Ye Liu, Yue Xue, Daoyuan Wu, Yuqiang Sun, Yi Li, Miaolei Shi, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:41:01Z

**Summary**: With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs,such as GPT-4, to transfer existing human-written properties (e.g.,those from Certora auditing reports) and automatically generate customized properties for unknown code. To this end, we embed existing properties into a vector database and retrieve a reference property for LLM-based in-context learning to generate a new property for a given code. While this basic process is relatively straightforward, ensuring that the generated properties are (i) compilable, (ii) appropriate, and (iii) verifiable presents challenges. To address (i), we use the compilation and static analysis feedback as an external oracle to guide LLMs in iteratively revising the generated properties. For (ii), we consider multiple dimensions of similarity to rank the properties and employ a weighted algorithm to identify the top-K properties as the final result. For (iii), we design a dedicated prover to formally verify the correctness of the generated properties. We have implemented these strategies into a novel LLM-based property generation tool called PropertyGPT. Our experiments show that PropertyGPT can generate comprehensive and high-quality properties, achieving an 80% recall compared to the ground truth. It successfully detected 26 CVEs/attack incidents out of 37 tested and also uncovered 12 zero-day vulnerabilities, leading to $8,256 in bug bounty rewards.

### Plentiful Jailbreaks with String Compositions
**Authors**: Brian R. Y. Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:39:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to a slew of adversarial attacks and jailbreaking methods. One common approach employed by white-hat attackers, or red-teamers, is to process model inputs and outputs using string-level obfuscations, which can include leetspeak, rotary ciphers, Base64, ASCII, and more. Our work extends these encoding-based attacks by unifying them in a framework of invertible string transformations. With invertibility, we can devise arbitrary string compositions, defined as sequences of transformations, that we can encode and decode end-to-end programmatically. We devise a automated best-of-n attack that samples from a combinatorially large number of string compositions. Our jailbreaks obtain competitive attack success rates on several leading frontier models when evaluated on HarmBench, highlighting that encoding-based attacks remain a persistent vulnerability even in advanced LLMs.

**Authors**: Konstantin Chernyshev, Vitaliy Polshkov, Ekaterina Artemova, Alex Myasnikov, Vlad Stepanov, Alexei Miasnikov, Sergei Tilga

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:29:43Z

**Summary**: The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.   To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.   The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.

### Generative Modelling of Structurally Constrained Graphs
**Authors**: Manuel Madeira, Clement Vignac, Dorina Thanou, Pascal Frossard

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T08:07:23Z

**Summary**: Graph diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques in graph generation; yet, integrating domain knowledge into these models remains challenging. Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications. Unconstrained and conditioned graph diffusion models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that enables graph diffusion models to incorporate hard constraints on specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity. Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that satisfy the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing an edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator. ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by incorporating planarity constraints in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines, improving data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points.

### WRF-GS: Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian   Splatting
**Authors**: Chaozheng Wen, Jingwen Tong, Yingdong Hu, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:56:14Z

**Summary**: Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.

### MobileFlow: A Multimodal LLM For Mobile GUI Agent
**Authors**: Songqin Nong, Jiali Zhu, Rui Wu, Jiongchao Jin, Shuo Shan, Xiutian Huang, Wenhao Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:43:34Z

**Summary**: Currently, the integration of mobile Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is ubiquitous in most people's daily lives. And the ongoing evolution of multimodal large-scale models, such as GPT-4v, Qwen-VL-Max, has significantly bolstered the capabilities of GUI comprehension and user action analysis, showcasing the potentiality of intelligent GUI assistants. However, current GUI Agents often need to access page layout information through calling system APIs, which may pose privacy risks. Fixing GUI (such as mobile interfaces) to a certain low resolution might result in the loss of fine-grained image details. At the same time, the multimodal large models built for GUI Agents currently have poor understanding and decision-making abilities for Chinese GUI interfaces, making them difficult to apply to a large number of Chinese apps. This paper introduces MobileFlow, a multimodal large language model meticulously crafted for mobile GUI agents. Transforming from the open-source model Qwen-VL-Chat into GUI domain, MobileFlow contains approximately 21 billion parameters and is equipped with novel hybrid visual encoders, making it possible for variable resolutions of image inputs and good support for multilingual GUI. By incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoE) expansions and pioneering alignment training strategies, MobileFlow has the capacity to fully interpret image data and comprehend user instructions for GUI interaction tasks. Finally, MobileFlow outperforms Qwen-VL-Max and GPT-4v in terms of task execution by GUI agents on both public and our proposed evaluation metrics, and has been successfully deployed in real-world business contexts, proving its effectiveness for practical applications.

### CCS: Continuous Learning for Customized Incremental Wireless Sensing   Services
**Authors**: Qunhang Fu, Fei Wang, Mengdie Zhu, Han Ding, Jinsong Han, Tony Xiao Han

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:29:34Z

**Summary**: Wireless sensing has made significant progress in tasks ranging from action recognition, vital sign estimation, pose estimation, etc. After over a decade of work, wireless sensing currently stands at the tipping point transitioning from proof-of-concept systems to the large-scale deployment. We envision a future service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute sensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing capabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or vacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that can detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them. In this paper, we propose CCS (continuous customized service), enabling model updates on users' local computing resources without data transmission to the service providers. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model updates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to the loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight alignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new capabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive experiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially introduced new customized demands. The results affirm that CCS excels in continuous model services across all the above wireless modalities, significantly outperforming existing approaches like OneFi.

### LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware   Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos
**Authors**: Tiantian Geng, Jinrui Zhang, Qingni Wang, Teng Wang, Jinming Duan, Feng Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:24:10Z

**Summary**: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.

### Automated Federated Pipeline for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Xianhao Chen, Yue Gao, Yuguang Fang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:10:30Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a surge in the development of advanced intelligent generative content (AIGC), especially large language models (LLMs). However, for many downstream tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using private data. While federated learning offers a promising privacy-preserving solution to LLM fine-tuning, the substantial size of an LLM, combined with high computational and communication demands, makes it hard to apply to downstream tasks. More importantly, private edge servers often possess varying computing and network resources in real-world scenarios, introducing additional complexities to LLM fine-tuning. To tackle these problems, we design and implement an automated federated pipeline, named FedPipe, to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training cost but without adding any inference latency. FedPipe firstly identifies the weights to be fine-tuned based on their contributions to the LLM training. It then configures a low-rank adapter for each selected weight to train local low-rank adapters on an edge server, and aggregate local adapters of all edge servers to fine-tune the whole LLM. Finally, it appropriately quantizes the parameters of LLM to reduce memory space according to the requirements of edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPipe expedites the model training and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

### SJTU:Spatial judgments in multimodal models towards unified segmentation   through coordinate detection
**Authors**: Joongwon Chae, Zhenyu Wang, Peiwu Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T07:08:56Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advances in vision-language understanding, implementing image segmentation within multimodal architectures remains a fundamental challenge in modern artificial intelligence systems. Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in Multimodal Models - Towards Unified Segmentation through Coordinate Detection, a framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework presents an approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models through spatial inference in multimodal space. By utilizing normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and transforming them into actionable segmentation outputs, we establish a connection between spatial and language representations in multimodal architectures. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets, achieving IoU scores of 0.5958 on COCO 2017 and 0.6758 on Pascal VOC. Testing on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 512x512 resolution images yields an average inference time of 7 seconds per image, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in both accuracy and practical deployability.

### PsycoLLM: Enhancing LLM for Psychological Understanding and Evaluation
**Authors**: Jinpeng Hu, Tengteng Dong, Luo Gang, Hui Ma, Peng Zou, Xiao Sun, Dan Guo, Xun Yang, Meng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:51:46Z

**Summary**: Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and LLM can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue. However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a specialized psychological large language model (LLM), named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multi-turn dialogues and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multi-turn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other LLMs.

### Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with LLMs via Nearest Neighbor   Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Jayanie Bogahawatte, Sachith Seneviratne, Maneesha Perera, Saman Halgamuge

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:32:47Z

**Summary**: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.

### Practicing Stress Relief for the Everyday: Designing Social Simulation   Using VR, AR, and LLMs
**Authors**: Anna Fang, Hriday Chhabria, Alekhya Maram, Haiyi Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:25:54Z

**Summary**: Stress is an inevitable part of day-to-day life yet many find themselves unable to manage it themselves, particularly when professional or peer support are not always readily available. As self-care becomes increasingly vital for mental well-being, this paper explores the potential of social simulation as a safe, virtual environment for practicing stress relief for everyday situations. Leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR, AR, and LLMs, we developed eight interactive prototypes for various everyday stressful scenarios (e.g. public speaking) then conducted prototype-driven semi-structured interviews with 19 participants. We reveal that people currently lack effective means to support themselves through everyday stress and found that social simulation fills a gap for simulating real environments for training mental health practices. We outline key considerations for future development of simulation for self-care, including risks of trauma from hyper-realism, distrust of LLM-recommended timing for mental health recommendations, and the value of accessibility for self-care interventions.

### Opus: A Large Work Model for Complex Workflow Generation
**Authors**: Théo Fagnoni, Bellinda Mesbah, Mahsun Altin, Phillip Kingston

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T06:05:59Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces Opus, a novel framework for generating and optimizing Workflows tailored to complex Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) use cases, focusing on cost reduction and quality enhancement while adhering to established industry processes and operational constraints. Our approach generates executable Workflows from Intention, defined as the alignment of Client Input, Client Output, and Process Context. These Workflows are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with nodes as Tasks consisting of sequences of executable Instructions, including tools and human expert reviews. We adopt a two-phase methodology: Workflow Generation and Workflow Optimization. In the Generation phase, Workflows are generated using a Large Work Model (LWM) informed by a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) that encodes domain-specific procedural and operational knowledge. In the Optimization phase, Workflows are transformed into Workflow Graphs (WFGs), where optimal Workflows are determined through path optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in reliably retrieving detailed process data as well as generating industry-compliant workflows. The key contributions of this paper include integrating a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) into a Large Work Model (LWM) to enable the generation of context-aware, semantically aligned, structured and auditable Workflows. It further introduces a two-phase approach that combines Workflow Generation from Intention with graph-based Workflow Optimization. Finally, we present Opus Alpha 1 Large and Opus Alpha 1 Small that outperform state-of-the-art LLMs by 38% and 29% respectively in Workflow Generation for a Medical Coding use case.

**Authors**: Yihang Zheng, Bo Li, Zhenghao Lin, Yi Luo, Xuanhe Zhou, Chen Lin, Jinsong Su, Guoliang Li, Shifu Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T05:51:06Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized QA across various industries, including the database domain. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of different LLMs and their modular components in database QA. To this end, we introduce DQABench, the first comprehensive database QA benchmark for LLMs. DQABench features an innovative LLM-based method to automate the generation, cleaning, and rewriting of evaluation dataset, resulting in over 200,000 QA pairs in English and Chinese, separately. These QA pairs cover a wide range of database-related knowledge extracted from manuals, online communities, and database instances. This inclusion allows for an additional assessment of LLMs' Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Tool Invocation Generation (TIG) capabilities in the database QA task. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive LLM-based database QA testbed DQATestbed. This testbed is highly modular and scalable, with basic and advanced components such as Question Classification Routing (QCR), RAG, TIG, and Prompt Template Engineering (PTE). Moreover, DQABench provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that computes various metrics throughout a standardized evaluation process to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the evaluation. We use DQABench to evaluate the database QA capabilities under the proposed testbed comprehensively. The evaluation reveals findings like (i) the strengths and limitations of nine LLM-based QA bots and (ii) the performance impact and potential improvements of various service components (e.g., QCR, RAG, TIG). Our benchmark and findings will guide the future development of LLM-based database QA research.

### GUIDE: A Global Unified Inference Engine for Deploying Large Language   Models in Heterogeneous Environments
**Authors**: Yanyu Chen, Ganhong Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T05:46:43Z

**Summary**: Efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge, primarily due to hardware heterogeneity, inference framework limitations, and workload complexities.Efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge, primarily due to hardware heterogeneity, inference framework limitations, and workload complexities. These challenges often lead to inefficiencies in memory utilization, latency, and throughput, hindering the effective deployment of LLMs, especially for non-experts. Through extensive experiments, we identify key performance bottlenecks, including sudden drops in memory utilization, latency fluctuations with varying batch sizes, and inefficiencies in multi-GPU configurations. These insights reveal a vast optimization space shaped by the intricate interplay of hardware, frameworks, and workload parameters. This underscores the need for a systematic approach to optimize LLM inference, motivating the design of our framework, GUIDE. GUIDE leverages dynamic modeling and simulation-based optimization to address these issues, achieving prediction errors between 25% and 55% for key metrics such as batch latency, TTFT, and decode throughput. By effectively bridging the gap between theoretical performance and practical deployment, our framework empowers practitioners, particularly non-specialists, to make data-driven decisions and unlock the full potential of LLMs in heterogeneous environments cheaply.

### Direct Quantized Training of Language Models with Stochastic Rounding
**Authors**: Kaiyan Zhao, Tsuguchika Tabaru, Kenichi Kobayashi, Takumi Honda, Masafumi Yamazaki, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T05:41:11Z

**Summary**: Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weight matrices required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore the potential of directly updating the quantized low-precision weight matrices without relying on the straight-through estimator during backpropagation, thereby saving memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values, (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits results in only a 5% loss degradation compared to BitNet b1.58 while offering the potential for reduced memory usage during training, and (3) our models can also perform inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.

**Authors**: Jiahao Zhang, Ryota Yoshihashi, Shunsuke Kitada, Atsuki Osanai, Yuta Nakashima

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T05:16:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for layout generation due to their ability to produce structure-description languages, such as HTML or JSON, even without access to visual information. Recently, LLM providers have evolved these models into large vision-language models (LVLM), which shows prominent multi-modal understanding capabilities. Then, how can we leverage this multi-modal power for layout generation? To answer this, we propose Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR) for LVLM-based content-aware layout generation. In our method, LVLMs iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster backgrounds. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method combined with the Gemini. Without any additional training, VASCAR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) layout generation quality outperforming both existing layout-specific generative models and other LLM-based methods.

**Authors**: Zhaojun Ding, Zhengliang Liu, Hanqi Jiang, Yizhu Gao, Xiaoming Zhai, Tianming Liu, Ninghao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T04:34:45Z

**Summary**: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for working with natural language, bringing advances in many areas of computational linguistics. However, these models face challenges when applied to low-resource languages due to limited training data and difficulty in understanding cultural nuances. Research is now focusing on multilingual models to improve LLM performance for these languages. Education in these languages also struggles with a lack of resources and qualified teachers, particularly in underdeveloped regions. Here, LLMs can be transformative, supporting innovative methods like community-driven learning and digital platforms. This paper discusses how LLMs could enhance education for low-resource languages, emphasizing practical applications and benefits.

**Authors**: Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T04:08:34Z

**Summary**: Question answering represents a core capability of large language models (LLMs). However, when individuals encounter unfamiliar knowledge in texts, they often formulate questions that the text itself cannot answer due to insufficient understanding of the underlying information. Recent studies reveal that while LLMs can detect unanswerable questions, they struggle to assist users in reformulating these questions. Even advanced models like GPT-3.5 demonstrate limited effectiveness in this regard. To address this limitation, we propose DRS: Deep Question Reformulation with Structured Output, a novel zero-shot method aimed at enhancing LLMs ability to assist users in reformulating questions to extract relevant information from new documents. DRS combines the strengths of LLMs with a DFS-based algorithm to iteratively explore potential entity combinations and constrain outputs using predefined entities. This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation capabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DRS improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42%, while also enhancing the performance of open-source models, such as Gemma2-9B, from 26.35% to 56.75%.

### Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free   Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern
**Authors**: Hongyin Tang, Di Xiu, Lanrui Wang, Xiurui Geng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:46:06Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

**Authors**: Shivansh Chopra, Hussain Ahmad, Diksha Goel, Claudia Szabo

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:45:49Z

**Summary**: The increasing frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software systems underscore the urgent need for robust and effective methods of vulnerability assessment. However, existing approaches often rely on highly technical and abstract frameworks, which hinders understanding and increases the likelihood of exploitation, resulting in severe cyberattacks. Given the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse domains, this paper explores their potential application in cybersecurity, specifically for enhancing the assessment of software vulnerabilities. We propose ChatNVD, an LLM-based cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tool leveraging the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to provide context-rich insights and streamline vulnerability analysis for cybersecurity professionals, developers, and non-technical users. We develop three variants of ChatNVD, utilizing three prominent LLMs: GPT-4o mini by OpenAI, Llama 3 by Meta, and Gemini 1.5 Pro by Google. To evaluate their efficacy, we conduct a comparative analysis of these models using a comprehensive questionnaire comprising common security vulnerability questions, assessing their accuracy in identifying and analyzing software vulnerabilities. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs to address critical challenges in understanding and mitigation of software vulnerabilities.

### Code generation and runtime techniques for enabling data-efficient deep   learning training on GPUs
**Authors**: Kun Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:20:03Z

**Summary**: As deep learning models scale, their training cost has surged significantly. Due to both hardware advancements and limitations in current software stacks, the need for data efficiency has risen. Data efficiency refers to the effective hiding of data access latency and the avoidance of unnecessary data movements. Major challenges arise from the growing disparity between GPU memory bandwidth and computational throughput, imminent GPU memory capacity limitations, and inefficiencies in the PyTorch software stack, including a lack of device-specific PCIe transfer optimizations and high-level domain-specific abstractions. To effectively mitigate these data inefficiencies for deep learning training, this dissertation analyzes data inefficiency in representative deep training tasks, specifically in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). It then proposes novel runtime and code generation techniques to mitigate these challenges and implements these optimizations seamlessly within the PyTorch stack while maintaining strong programmability and interoperability. First, PyTorch-Direct is devised to incorporate the GPU-centric PCIe data transfer paradigm in PyTorch for GNN training. Next, Hector intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator are proposed to introduce domain-specific high-level abstraction and systematically address memory-intensive performance challenges for relational GNNs. Finally, in LLM training, the throughput has been increasingly constrained by GPU memory capacity. To mitigate this, the SSDTrain offloading framework is designed and implemented. Together, these contributions show that code generation and runtime techniques can systematically mitigate the data management bottlenecks in deep learning training, which stem from the data-intensive nature of workloads and the oversimplification inherent in the deep learning training software stack.

### Diff4Steer: Steerable Diffusion Prior for Generative Music Retrieval   with Semantic Guidance
**Authors**: Xuchan Bao, Judith Yue Li, Zhong Yi Wan, Kun Su, Timo Denk, Joonseok Lee, Dima Kuzmin, Fei Sha

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:18:18Z

**Summary**: Modern music retrieval systems often rely on fixed representations of user preferences, limiting their ability to capture users' diverse and uncertain retrieval needs. To address this limitation, we introduce Diff4Steer, a novel generative retrieval framework that employs lightweight diffusion models to synthesize diverse seed embeddings from user queries that represent potential directions for music exploration. Unlike deterministic methods that map user query to a single point in embedding space, Diff4Steer provides a statistical prior on the target modality (audio) for retrieval, effectively capturing the uncertainty and multi-faceted nature of user preferences. Furthermore, Diff4Steer can be steered by image or text inputs, enabling more flexible and controllable music discovery combined with nearest neighbor search. Our framework outperforms deterministic regression methods and LLM-based generative retrieval baseline in terms of retrieval and ranking metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user preferences, leading to more diverse and relevant recommendations. Listening examples are available at tinyurl.com/diff4steer.

### SimMLP: Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision
**Authors**: Zehong Wang, Zheyuan Zhang, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T02:46:38Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/SimMLP.

### BESSTIE: A Benchmark for Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification for   Varieties of English
**Authors**: Dipankar Srirag, Aditya Joshi, Jordan Painter, Diptesh Kanojia

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T02:34:40Z

**Summary**: Despite large language models (LLMs) being known to exhibit bias against non-mainstream varieties, there are no known labeled datasets for sentiment analysis of English. To address this gap, we introduce BESSTIE, a benchmark for sentiment and sarcasm classification for three varieties of English: Australian (en-AU), Indian (en-IN), and British (en-UK). Using web-based content from two domains, namely, Google Place reviews and Reddit comments, we collect datasets for these language varieties using two methods: location-based and topic-based filtering. Native speakers of the language varieties manually annotate the datasets with sentiment and sarcasm labels. Subsequently, we fine-tune nine large language models (LLMs) (representing a range of encoder/decoder and mono/multilingual models) on these datasets, and evaluate their performance on the two tasks. Our results reveal that the models consistently perform better on inner-circle varieties (i.e., en-AU and en-UK), with significant performance drops for en-IN, particularly in sarcasm detection. We also report challenges in cross-variety generalisation, highlighting the need for language variety-specific datasets such as ours. BESSTIE promises to be a useful evaluative benchmark for future research in equitable LLMs, specifically in terms of language varieties. The BESSTIE datasets, code, and models are currently available on request, while the paper is under review. Please email aditya.joshi@unsw.edu.au.

### Adaptive Optimization for Enhanced Efficiency in Large-Scale Language   Model Training
**Authors**: Jiajing Chen, Bingying Liu, Xiaoxuan Liao, Jia Gao, Hongye Zheng, Yue Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T02:17:30Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of natural language processing technology, large-scale language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable results in a variety of tasks. However, how to effectively train these huge models and improve their performance and computational efficiency remains an important challenge. This paper proposes an improved method based on adaptive optimization algorithm, aiming to improve the training efficiency and final performance of LLM. Through comparative experiments on the SQuAD and GLUE data sets, the experimental results show that compared with traditional optimization algorithms (such as SGD, Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam), the adaptive optimization algorithm we proposed has better accuracy and F1 score. Both have achieved significant improvements, especially showed stronger training capabilities when processed large-scale texts and complex tasks. The research results verify the advantages of adaptive optimization algorithms in large-scale language model training and provide new ideas and directions for future optimization methods.

### Automated Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models on Self-driving   Corner Cases
**Authors**: Kai Chen, Yanze Li, Wenhua Zhang, Yanxin Liu, Pengxiang Li, Ruiyuan Gao, Lanqing Hong, Meng Tian, Xinhai Zhao, Zhenguo Li, Dit-Yan Yeung, Huchuan Lu, Xu Jia

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:54:59Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have received widespread attention for advancing the interpretable self-driving. Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this work, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure and prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotations for the human annotators, while for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with our CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task. We hope CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote interpretable self-driving empowered by LVLMs.

### Logic Agent: Enhancing Validity with Logic Rule Invocation
**Authors**: Hanmeng Liu, Zhiyang Teng, Chaoli Zhang, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:34:38Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for augmenting the inferential capabilities of language models during reasoning tasks. Despite its advancements, CoT often grapples with challenges in validating reasoning validity and ensuring informativeness. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process. This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate LA's capacity to scale effectively across various model sizes, markedly improving the precision of complex reasoning across diverse tasks.

### Transformers Struggle to Learn to Search
**Authors**: Abulhair Saparov, Srushti Pawar, Shreyas Pimpalgaonkar, Nitish Joshi, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Vishakh Padmakumar, Seyed Mehran Kazemi, Najoung Kim, He He

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:29:24Z

**Summary**: Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.   We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that for each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in the number of layers.   However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.

### Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Differential   Privacy
**Authors**: Tatsuki Koga, Ruihan Wu, Kamalika Chaudhuri

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:20:16Z

**Summary**: With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.

### Smoothie: Label Free Language Model Routing
**Authors**: Neel Guha, Mayee F. Chen, Trevor Chow, Ishan S. Khare, Christopher Ré

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:06:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where LLM inputs may span many different tasks. Recent work has found that the choice of LLM is consequential, and different LLMs may be good for different input samples. Prior approaches have thus explored how engineers might select an LLM to use for each sample (i.e. routing). While existing routing methods mostly require training auxiliary models on human-annotated data, our work explores whether it is possible to perform unsupervised routing. We propose Smoothie, a weak supervision-inspired routing approach that requires no labeled data. Given a set of outputs from different LLMs, Smoothie constructs a latent variable graphical model over embedding representations of observable LLM outputs and unknown "true" outputs. Using this graphical model, we estimate sample-dependent quality scores for each LLM, and route each sample to the LLM with the highest corresponding score. We find that Smoothie's LLM quality-scores correlate with ground-truth model quality (correctly identifying the optimal model on 9/14 tasks), and that Smoothie outperforms baselines for routing by up to 10 points accuracy.

### LLM-Align: Utilizing Large Language Models for Entity Alignment in   Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Xuan Chen, Tong Lu, Zhichun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:05:37Z

**Summary**: Entity Alignment (EA) seeks to identify and match corresponding entities across different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), playing a crucial role in knowledge fusion and integration. Embedding-based entity alignment (EA) has recently gained considerable attention, resulting in the emergence of many innovative approaches. Initially, these approaches concentrated on learning entity embeddings based on the structural features of knowledge graphs (KGs) as defined by relation triples. Subsequent methods have integrated entities' names and attributes as supplementary information to improve the embeddings used for EA. However, existing methods lack a deep semantic understanding of entity attributes and relations. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based Entity Alignment method, LLM-Align, which explores the instruction-following and zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models to infer alignments of entities. LLM-Align uses heuristic methods to select important attributes and relations of entities, and then feeds the selected triples of entities to an LLM to infer the alignment results. To guarantee the quality of alignment results, we design a multi-round voting mechanism to mitigate the hallucination and positional bias issues that occur with LLMs. Experiments on three EA datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing EA methods.

**Authors**: Nan Sun, Yuantian Miao, Hao Jiang, Ming Ding, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T00:46:20Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the complex interaction between innovation and regulation has become an emerging focus of our society. Despite tremendous advancements in AI's capabilities to excel in specific tasks and contribute to diverse sectors, establishing a high degree of trust in AI-generated outputs and decisions necessitates meticulous caution and continuous oversight. A broad spectrum of stakeholders, including governmental bodies, private sector corporations, academic institutions, and individuals, have launched significant initiatives. These efforts include developing ethical guidelines for AI and engaging in vibrant discussions on AI ethics, both among AI practitioners and within the broader society. This article thoroughly analyzes the ground-breaking AI regulatory framework proposed by the European Union. It delves into the fundamental ethical principles of safety, transparency, non-discrimination, traceability, and environmental sustainability for AI developments and deployments. Considering the technical efforts and strategies undertaken by academics and industry to uphold these principles, we explore the synergies and conflicts among the five ethical principles. Through this lens, work presents a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI regulations, advocating for a harmonized approach that safeguards societal values while encouraging technological advancement.

### Large Language Models Must Be Taught to Know What They Don't Know
**Authors**: Sanyam Kapoor, Nate Gruver, Manley Roberts, Katherine Collins, Arka Pal, Umang Bhatt, Adrian Weller, Samuel Dooley, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T23:48:19Z

**Summary**: When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.

### HEAL: Hierarchical Embedding Alignment Loss for Improved Retrieval and   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Manish Bhattarai, Ryan Barron, Maksim Eren, Minh Vu, Vesselin Grantcharov, Ismael Boureima, Valentin Stanev, Cynthia Matuszek, Vladimir Valtchinov, Kim Rasmussen, Boian Alexandrov

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T23:10:56Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external document retrieval to provide domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge. The effectiveness of RAG depends on the relevance of retrieved documents, which is influenced by the semantic alignment of embeddings with the domain's specialized content. Although full fine-tuning can align language models to specific domains, it is computationally intensive and demands substantial data. This paper introduces Hierarchical Embedding Alignment Loss (HEAL), a novel method that leverages hierarchical fuzzy clustering with matrix factorization within contrastive learning to efficiently align LLM embeddings with domain-specific content. HEAL computes level/depth-wise contrastive losses and incorporates hierarchical penalties to align embeddings with the underlying relationships in label hierarchies. This approach enhances retrieval relevance and document classification, effectively reducing hallucinations in LLM outputs. In our experiments, we benchmark and evaluate HEAL across diverse domains, including Healthcare, Material Science, Cyber-security, and Applied Maths.

### LiveNet: Robust, Minimally Invasive Multi-Robot Control for Safe and   Live Navigation in Constrained Environments
**Authors**: Srikar Gouru, Siddharth Lakkoju, Rohan Chandra

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T23:05:31Z

**Summary**: Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways, hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile, non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested, conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet is minimally invasive, without requiring inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness, which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LiveNet in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20 times slower, 4-5 times more invasive, and much less robust to variations in the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states, among others. We open-source the LiveNet code at https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet{https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet.

### An Efficient Model Maintenance Approach for MLOps
**Authors**: Forough Majidi, Foutse Khomh, Heng Li, Amin Nikanjam

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T23:02:02Z

**Summary**: In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning models (ML) in their systems. Ideally, machine learning models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to data and concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up to date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource intensive, costly, time consuming, and model dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent retraining. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on four time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the performance of models while significantly reducing maintenance time and costs. Our model reuse approach achieves ML performance comparable to the best baseline, while being 15 times more efficient in terms of computation time and costs. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain the performance of their ML models in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance costs.
