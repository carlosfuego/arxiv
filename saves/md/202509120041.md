**Authors**: Muhammad Taha Cheema, Abeer Aamir, Khawaja Gul Muhammad, Naveed Anwar Bhatti, Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, Zafar Ayyub Qazi

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer   Layer Caching
**Authors**: Siratish Sakpiboonchit

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:41:15Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference results can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ .

### BitROM: Weight Reload-Free CiROM Architecture Towards Billion-Parameter   1.58-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wenlun Zhang, Xinyu Li, Shimpei Ando, Kentaro Yoshioka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:46:29Z

**Summary**: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.

### Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split   Mechanism
**Authors**: Jiaming Yan, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:28:24Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

### EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Bohan Yu, Yekun Chai

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:32:49Z

**Summary**: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation.

### Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training
**Authors**: Chenlu Zhan, Wen Li, Chuyu Shen, Jun Zhang, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T06:16:31Z

**Summary**: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T13:30:17Z

**Summary**: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### DuoServe-MoE: Dual-Phase Expert Prefetch and Cache Scheduling for   Efficient MoE LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuning Zhang, Grant Pinkert, Nan Yang, Yanli Li, Dong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T04:00:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage. To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts, without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to 7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model size.

### BOLT: Bandwidth-Optimized Lightning-Fast Oblivious Map powered by Secure   HBM Accelerators
**Authors**: Yitong Guo, Hongbo Chen, Haobin Hiroki Chen, Yukui Luo, XiaoFeng Wang, Chenghong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T00:15:05Z

**Summary**: While Trusted Execution Environments provide a strong foundation for secure cloud computing, they remain vulnerable to access pattern leakages. Oblivious Maps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high overhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these costs are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that eavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its memory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same physical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper isolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and memory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with HBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits. Building on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized, Lightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) + O(log_2(log_2 (N))) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted architecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to mitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs that maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx U55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in initialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs, including an industry implementation from Facebook.

**Authors**: Yinjie Wang, Ling Yang, Bowen Li, Ye Tian, Ke Shen, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T17:58:06Z

**Summary**: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T17:22:17Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference is bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of CXL-based memory used for capacity expansion. We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T13:34:54Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

### CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View   Synthesis
**Authors**: Xin Kong, Daniel Watson, Yannick Strümpler, Michael Niemeyer, Federico Tombari

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T11:49:51Z

**Summary**: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

### Scaling up Multi-Turn Off-Policy RL and Multi-Agent Tree Search for LLM   Step-Provers
**Authors**: Ran Xin, Zeyu Zheng, Yanchen Nie, Kun Yuan, Xia Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T09:54:18Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

### Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action   Pretraining
**Authors**: Zijian Song, Sihan Qin, Tianshui Chen, Liang Lin, Guangrun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T09:09:36Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### HyFedRAG: A Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for   Heterogeneous and Privacy-Sensitive Data
**Authors**: Cheng Qian, Hainan Zhang, Yongxin Tong, Hong-Wei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T08:44:24Z

**Summary**: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are: (1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich, de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache, and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data, unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

### Tree of Agents: Improving Long-Context Capabilities of Large Language   Models through Multi-Perspective Reasoning
**Authors**: Song Yu, Xiaofei Xu, Ke Deng, Li Li, Lin Tian

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T08:34:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aireduce952/Tree-of-Agents.

### FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for   Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving
**Authors**: Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Jimyoung Son, Jieun Choi, Daseul Bae, Daehyeon Baek, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Hyojung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T00:57:50Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models (LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.

### A facile vector substrate platform via BaTiO3 membrane transfer enables   high quality solution processed epitaxial PZT on silicon
**Authors**: Asraful Haque, Antony Jeyaseelan, Shubham Kumar Parate, Srinivasan Raghavan, Pavan Nukala

**Updated**: 2025-09-07T13:15:17Z

**Summary**: The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.

### Tight Cache Contention Analysis for WCET Estimation on Multicore Systems
**Authors**: Shuai Zhao, Jieyu Jiang, Shenlin Cai, Yaowei Liang, Chen Jie, Yinjie Fang, Wei Zhang, Guoquan Zhang, Yaoyao Gu, Xiang Xiao, Wei Qin, Xiangzhen Ouyang, Wanli Chang

**Updated**: 2025-09-06T05:58:51Z

**Summary**: WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.

**Authors**: Arefin Niam, Tevfik Kosar, M S Q Zulkar Nine

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T16:10:20Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

### KVCompose: Efficient Structured KV Cache Compression with Composite   Tokens
**Authors**: Dmitry Akulov, Mohamed Sana, Antonio De Domenico, Tareq Si Salem, Nicola Piovesan, Fadhel Ayed

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T14:58:24Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute kernels.   We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

### Mainframe-Style Channel Controllers for Modern Disaggregated Memory   Systems
**Authors**: Zikai Liu, Jasmin Schult, Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T10:39:03Z

**Summary**: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.   However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.   In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.

**Authors**: Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Jie Ye, Xian-He Sun, Anthony Kougkas, Murali Emani, Venkatram Vishwanath, Bogdan Nicolae

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T16:40:01Z

**Summary**: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens, enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention. Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

**Authors**: Weile Luo, Ruibo Fan, Zeyu Li, Dayou Du, Hongyuan Liu, Qiang Wang, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T15:21:11Z

**Summary**: This study presents a comprehensive multi-level analysis of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, focusing on its performance characteristics and novel features. We benchmark Hopper's memory subsystem, highlighting improvements in the L2 partitioned cache and global memory access compared to Ampere and Ada Lovelace. The evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores reveals the benefits of FP8 precision and asynchronous wgmma instructions for matrix operations. Additionally, we investigate the performance of DPX instructions for dynamic programming, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM communication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data movement. Through multi-level evaluation, we discover that the Hopper architecture demonstrates significant acceleration potential in real-world applications. For instance, the asynchronous programming model supported by TMA achieves a 1.5x speedup in matrix multiplication, FP8 delivers nearly double the performance of FP16, and DPX instructions accelerate a computational biology algorithm by at least 4.75x. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing compute-intensive workloads, from AI training to bioinformatics, on Hopper GPUs.

### InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via   ICL-oriented Prefix Caching
**Authors**: Yilun Wang, Pengfei Chen, Haiyu Huang, Zilong He, Gou Tan, Chuanfu Zhang, Jingkai He, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T13:14:33Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.   In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.

### Set Block Decoding is a Language Model Inference Accelerator
**Authors**: Itai Gat, Heli Ben-Hamu, Marton Havasi, Daniel Haziza, Jeremy Reizenstein, Gabriel Synnaeve, David Lopez-Paz, Brian Karrer, Yaron Lipman

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T13:02:39Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

### VisioFirm: Cross-Platform AI-assisted Annotation Tool for Computer   Vision
**Authors**: Safouane El Ghazouali, Umberto Michelucci

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T12:54:32Z

**Summary**: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from \href{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}.

### Spotlight Attention: Towards Efficient LLM Generation via Non-linear   Hashing-based KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Yuxin Zhang, Gen Luo, Haiyuan Wan, Ziyang Gong, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T06:45:58Z

**Summary**: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

### Systematic Timing Leakage Analysis of NIST PQDSS Candidates: Tooling and   Lessons Learned
**Authors**: Olivier Adjonyo, Sebastien Bardin, Emanuele Bellini, Gilbert Ndollane Dione, Mahmudul Faisal Al Ameen, Robert Merget, Frederic Recoules, Yanis Sellami

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T08:41:06Z

**Summary**: The PQDSS standardization process requires cryptographic primitives to be free from vulnerabilities, including timing and cache side-channels. Resistance to timing leakage is therefore an essential property, and achieving this typically relies on software implementations that follow constant-time principles. Moreover, ensuring that all implementations are constant-time is crucial for fair performance comparisons, as secure implementations often incur additional overhead. Such analysis also helps identify scheme proposals that are inherently difficult to implement in constant time. Because constant-time properties can be broken during compilation, it is often necessary to analyze the compiled binary directly. Since manual binary analysis is extremely challenging, automated analysis becomes highly important. Although several tools exist to assist with such analysis, they often have usability limitations and are difficult to set up correctly. To support the developers besides the NIST committee in verifying candidates, we developed a toolchain that automates configuration, execution, and result analysis for several widely used constant-time analysis tools. We selected TIMECOP and Binsec/Rel2 to verify constant-time policy compliance at the binary level, and dudect and RTLF to detect side-channel vulnerabilities through statistical analysis of execution time behavior. We demonstrate its effectiveness and practicability by evaluating the NIST PQDSS round 1 and round 2 implementations. We reported 26 issues in total to the respective developers, and 5 of them have already been fixed. We also discuss our different findings, as well as the benefits of shortcomings of the different tools.

### IC-Cache: Efficient Large Language Model Serving via In-context Caching
**Authors**: Yifan Yu, Yu Gan, Nikhil Sarda, Lillian Tsai, Jiaming Shen, Yanqi Zhou, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Fan Lai, Henry M. Levy, David Culler

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T06:20:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 70% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge transfer among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to a big quality drop. In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a caching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving efficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models as in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed the compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts, enabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving this live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between response quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache efficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new request's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality offline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency. Evaluations on millions of realistic requests demonstrate that IC-Cache improves LLM serving throughput by 1.4-5.9x and reduces latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality.

### ConServe: Fine-Grained GPU Harvesting for LLM Online and Offline   Co-Serving
**Authors**: Yifan Qiao, Shu Anzai, Shan Yu, Haoran Ma, Shuo Yang, Yang Wang, Miryung Kim, Yongji Wu, Yang Zhou, Jiarong Xing, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Harry Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T20:54:57Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) serving demands low latency and high throughput, but high load variability makes it challenging to achieve high GPU utilization. In this paper, we identify a synergetic but overlooked opportunity to co-serve latency-critical online requests alongside latency-tolerant offline tasks such as model benchmarking. While promising, existing serving systems fail to co-serve them efficiently, as their coarse-grained resource management at the request or iteration level cannot harvest millisecond-level GPU idle cycles without introducing interference that violates online latency objectives. ConServe is a new LLM co-serving system that achieves high throughput and strong online latency guarantees by managing resources at finer granularities. ConServe introduces three techniques: (1) a latency-aware token-level scheduler that precisely sizes offline batches and tokens to fit within online latency objectives; (2) sub-iteration, layer-wise preemption that allows offline tasks to yield to online load spikes; and (3) incremental KV cache management that enables preempting and resuming offline requests at near-zero cost. Evaluations with Llama-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 models on real-world workloads show that ConServe delivers an average of 2.2$\times$ higher throughput and reduces online serving tail latency by 2.9$\times$ on average compared to state-of-the-art systems.

### CloudFormer: An Attention-based Performance Prediction for Public Clouds   with Unknown Workload
**Authors**: Amirhossein Shahbazinia, Darong Huang, Luis Costero, David Atienza

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:15:44Z

**Summary**: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse, resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage, it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads. To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.

### Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Ruoyu Qin, Zheming Li, Weiran He, Mingxing Zhang, Yongwei Wu, Weimin Zheng, Xinran Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:29Z

**Summary**: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.

### RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy via Chunk-based   Sequence Modeling
**Authors**: Xiuying Wei, Anunay Yadav, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:28:23Z

**Summary**: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results. Code is available at https://github.com/CLAIRE-Labo/RAT.

### A Cegar-centric Bounded Reachability Analysis for Compositional Affine   Hybrid Systems
**Authors**: Atanu Kundu, Pratyay Sarkar, Rajarshi Ray

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:23:35Z

**Summary**: Reachability analysis of compositional hybrid systems, where individual components are modeled as hybrid automata, poses unique challenges. In addition to preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors, algorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the parallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability analysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine dynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR). In particular, the algorithm searches for a counterexample in the discrete abstraction of the composition model, without explicitly computing a product automaton. When a counterexample is discovered in the abstraction, its validity is verified by a refinement of the state-space guided by the abstract counterexample. The state-space refinement is through a symbolic reachability analysis, particularly using a state-of-the-art algorithm with support functions as the continuous state representation. In addition, the algorithm mixes different semantics of composition with the objective of improved efficiency. Step compositional semantics is followed while exploring the abstract (discrete) state-space, while shallow compositional semantics is followed during state-space refinement with symbolic reachability analysis. Optimizations such as caching the results of the symbolic reachability analysis, which can be later reused, have been proposed. We implement this algorithm in the tool SAT-Reach and demonstrate the scalability benefits.

### Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget
**Authors**: Chenxia Tang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:38:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or comparable.

### FastCache: Fast Caching for Diffusion Transformer Through Learnable   Linear Approximation
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Yifan Li, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:56:21Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

### Digital Network Twins for Next-generation Wireless: Creation,   Optimization, and Challenges
**Authors**: Zifan Zhang, Zhiyuan Peng, Hanzhi Yu, Mingzhe Chen, Yuchen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T18:10:00Z

**Summary**: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.

### A Novel Coded Caching Scheme for Partially Cooperative Device-to-Device   Networks
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T17:35:42Z

**Summary**: Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the most promising techniques for future wireless cellular communication systems. This paper considers coded caching in a partially cooperative wireless D2D network, where only a subset of users transmit during delivery, while all users request files. The non-transmitting users are referred to as selfish users. All existing schemes that do not require knowledge of the identity of selfish users before content placement are limited to the high-memory regime, particularly when the number of selfish users is large. We propose a novel coded caching scheme for a partially cooperative D2D network that operates in all feasible memory regimes, regardless of the number of selfish users. We also derive a lower bound on the transmission load of a partially cooperative D2D coded caching scheme. Using this bound, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the high-memory regime.

**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Michael Papamichael, Mohammad Dohadwala, Lukas Gianinazzi, Mikhail Khalilov, Elias Achermann, Daniele De Sensi, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T16:39:56Z

**Summary**: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. However, existing Ethernet-based solutions, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilization due to both increasing traffic demands and the expanding scale of datacenter topologies, which also exacerbate network failures. To address these limitations, we propose REPS, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. REPS adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, REPS re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. REPS is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and uses less than 25 bytes of per-connection state regardless of the topology size. We extensively evaluate REPS in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.

### MLP-Offload: Multi-Level, Multi-Path Offloading for LLM Pre-training to   Break the GPU Memory Wall
**Authors**: Avinash Maurya, M. Mustafa Rafique, Franck Cappello, Bogdan Nicolae

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T16:30:49Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

### Cache Management for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs -- extended version
**Authors**: Spyros Angelopoulos, Loris Marchal, Adrien Obrecht, Bertrand Simon

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T15:19:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.   In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.   Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging problem, such as the standard LRU.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T13:09:37Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To scale efficiently, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 78.9% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our work highlights that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### Efficient Geometry Compression and Communication for 3D Gaussian   Splatting Point Clouds
**Authors**: Liang Xie, Yanting Li, Luyang Tang, Wei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T11:58:06Z

**Summary**: Storage and transmission challenges in dynamic 3D scene representation based on the i3DV platform, With increasing scene complexity, the explosive growth of 3D Gaussian data volume causes excessive storage space occupancy. To address this issue, we propose adopting the AVS PCRM reference software for efficient compression of Gaussian point cloud geometry data. The strategy deeply integrates the advanced encoding capabilities of AVS PCRM into the i3DV platform, forming technical complementarity with the original rate-distortion optimization mechanism based on binary hash tables. On one hand, the hash table efficiently caches inter-frame Gaussian point transformation relationships, which allows for high-fidelity transmission within a 40 Mbps bandwidth constraint. On the other hand, AVS PCRM performs precise compression on geometry data. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint framework maintains the advantages of fast rendering and high-quality synthesis in 3D Gaussian technology while achieving significant 10\%-25\% bitrate savings on universal test sets. It provides a superior rate-distortion tradeoff solution for the storage, transmission, and interaction of 3D volumetric video.

### SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache   Channel Pruning
**Authors**: Huanxuan Liao, Yixing Xu, Shizhu He, Guanchen Li, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T11:29:34Z

**Summary**: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

### Batch Query Processing and Optimization for Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Junyi Shen, Noppanat Wadlom, Yao Lu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T09:17:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows combine multi-step reasoning, tool use, and collaboration across multiple specialized agents. Existing LLM serving engines optimize individual calls in isolation, while multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and concurrent executions create substantial redundancy and poor GPU utilization, especially in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consolidated graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost model that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU placement, Halo performs plan-level optimization to minimize redundant execution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and migration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to 18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput improvement under online serving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality. By unifying query optimization with LLM serving, Halo enables efficient agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

### Augmented Shuffle Differential Privacy Protocols for Large-Domain   Categorical and Key-Value Data
**Authors**: Takao Murakami, Yuichi Sei, Reo Eriguchi

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T06:40:45Z

**Summary**: Shuffle DP (Differential Privacy) protocols provide high accuracy and privacy by introducing a shuffler who randomly shuffles data in a distributed system. However, most shuffle DP protocols are vulnerable to two attacks: collusion attacks by the data collector and users and data poisoning attacks. A recent study addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol, where users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and dummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over categorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain due to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.   In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP protocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME protocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately calculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of interaction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates within a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to more advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique to reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol provides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy, and efficiency. We show the effectiveness of our proposals through comparisons with twelve existing protocols.

### LLMs cannot spot math errors, even when allowed to peek into the   solution
**Authors**: KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T11:41:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.

### Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating   Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer
**Authors**: Euntae Choi, Sumin Song, Woosang Lim, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T07:26:57Z

**Summary**: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code is available at https://github.com/ songsm921/RCP.

### ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching
**Authors**: Xiaoniu Song, Zihang Zhong, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:51:09Z

**Summary**: The promising applications of large language models are often limited by the constrained GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help address this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation. This approach allows the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory, thereby reducing the overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively, which significantly impacts system performance. In this paper, we introduce ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that utilizes intermediate results to predict subsequent expert usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE eliminates passive cache misses, removes loading time from the critical path, and reduces the performance overhead associated with offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.20x (up to 3.21x) and 2.07x (up to 5.02x) in the prefill and decode stages, respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

### REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding
**Authors**: Xiaoqiang Lin, Aritra Ghosh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Anshumali Shrivastava, Vijai Mohan

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:31:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

### LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths
**Authors**: Meixuan Wang, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T15:09:36Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Accelerating Latency-Critical Applications with AI-Powered   Semi-Automatic Fine-Grained Parallelization on SMT Processors
**Authors**: Denis Los, Igor Petushkov

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T14:51:19Z

**Summary**: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications. Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization. Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

### Yet Another Mirage of Breaking MIRAGE: Debunking Occupancy-based   Side-Channel Attacks on Fully Associative Randomized Caches
**Authors**: Chris Cao, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T05:43:55Z

**Summary**: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

### NetGent: Agent-Based Automation of Network Application Workflows
**Authors**: Jaber Daneshamooz, Eugene Vuong, Laasya Koduru, Sanjay Chandrasekaran, Arpit Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T22:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly. NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments, NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping, producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

### KVComp: A High-Performance, LLM-Aware, Lossy Compression Framework for   KV Cache
**Authors**: Bo Jiang, Taolue Yang, Youyuan Liu, Chengming Zhang, Xubin He, Sian Jin

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T18:25:19Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with less data movement.

### Discrete and Continuous Caching Games
**Authors**: Áron Jánosik, Csenge Miklós, Dániel G. Simon, Kristóf Zólomy

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T14:49:34Z

**Summary**: We investigate a discrete search game called the Multiple Caching Game where the searcher's aim is to find all of a set of $d$ treasures hidden in $n$ locations. Allowed queries are sets of locations of size $k$, and the searcher wins if in all $d$ queries, at least one treasure is hidden in one of the $k$ picked locations. P\'alv\"olgyi showed that the value of the game is at most $\frac{k^d}{\binom{n+d-1}{d}}$, with equality for large enough $n$. We conjecture the exact cases of equality. We also investigate variants of the game and show an example where their values are different, answering a question of P\'alv\"olgyi.   This game is closely related to a continuous variant, Alpern's Caching Game, based on which we define other continous variants of the multiple caching game and examine their values.

### DiffKV: Differentiated Memory Management for Large Language Models with   Parallel KV Compaction
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T09:35:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face substantial serving costs due to their high memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. State-of-the-art KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained distinctions in the significance of individual KV cache components. To address such limitations, we introduce \textit{DiffKV}, a novel framework for efficient KV cache compression that exploits three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. These levels of differentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different requests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for memory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the emerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought. DiffKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$.

### LightVLM: Acceleraing Large Multimodal Models with Pyramid Token Merging   and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Lianyu Hu, Fanhua Shang, Wei Feng, Liang Wan

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T08:57:53Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput. Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B), hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by 3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

### GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV   Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Xuelin Li, Xiangqi Jin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T06:56:28Z

**Summary**: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this, we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces   via Generalized Winding Numbers
**Authors**: Jacob Spainhour, Kenneth Weiss

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T20:39:21Z

**Summary**: We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.

### From TLinFormer to TConstFormer: The Leap to Constant-Time Transformer   Attention: Achieving O(1) Computation and O(1) KV Cache during Autoregressive   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongpan Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T19:23:35Z

**Summary**: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer. TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed, memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model applications.

### Democratizing Agentic AI with Fast Test-Time Scaling on the Edge
**Authors**: Hao Mark Chen, Zhiwen Mo, Guanxi Lu, Shuang Liang, Lingxiao Ma, Wayne Luk, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T19:12:04Z

**Summary**: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline, paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

### Towards Compute-Optimal Many-Shot In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Shahriar Golchin, Yanfei Chen, Rujun Han, Manan Gandhi, Tianli Yu, Swaroop Mishra, Mihai Surdeanu, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T18:45:22Z

**Summary**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

### Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T09:58:17Z

**Summary**: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

### FedSEA-LLaMA: A Secure, Efficient and Adaptive Federated Splitting   Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zishuai Zhang, Hainan zhang, Weihua Li, Qinnan zhang, jin Dong, Yongxin Tong, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T07:40:34Z

**Summary**: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

### Enhancing LLM Efficiency: Targeted Pruning for Prefill-Decode   Disaggregation in Inference
**Authors**: Hao Zhang, Mengsi Lyu, Yulong Ao, Yonghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T02:29:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

### Deep Multiple Quantization Network on Long Behavior Sequence for   Click-Through Rate Prediction
**Authors**: Zhuoxing Wei, Qi Liu, Qingchen Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T14:58:47Z

**Summary**: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence, comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item. Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then, attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

### SOT-MRAM Bitcell Scaling with BEOL Read Selectors: A DTCO Study
**Authors**: Yang Xiang, Fernando García-Redondo, Arvind Sharma, Van Dai Nguyen, Andrea Fantini, Philippe Matagne, Siddharth Rao, Subhali Subhechha, Lynn Verschueren, Mohammed Aftab Baig, Marie Garcia Bardon, Geert Hellings

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T08:49:24Z

**Summary**: This work explores the cross-node scaling potential of SOT-MRAM for last-level caches (LLCs) under heterogeneous system scaling paradigm. We perform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to evaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a representative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and write power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in conventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary bitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL RSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match sub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet the required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties be engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This is particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write transistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We nevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the low-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the imperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\times$ energy cost relative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and hurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of SOT-MRAM.

### Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition Accelerated Linear Boltzmann Transport   Equation Solver for Fast Scatter Correction in Multi-Spectral CT
**Authors**: Guoxi Zhu, Li Zhang, Zhiqiang Chen, Hewei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T08:05:42Z

**Summary**: X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading to image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter estimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute multiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying LBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute X-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different spectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy and nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum solver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to expand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a principle of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the above solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter correction method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo method, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter correction performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based dual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for kV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can significantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively reduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.

### MegaCacheX: Towards Cost-Effective Hierarchical Collaborative Content   Caching in Emerging Mega-Constellations
**Authors**: Haoyang Shi, Xing Zhang, Sitong Li, Minghang Li, Xinming Lu, Shaoxiang Xu, Guoquan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T05:22:25Z

**Summary**: Significant latency in global content delivery primarily arises from insufficient terrestrial infrastructure. Deploying space-based content delivery networks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to bridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from physical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying inter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition, existing mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global optimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical framework for collaborative content distribution that achieves "Earth-independence" by providing cloud services directly from space. Specifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content sources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations collaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching strategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and satellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service anchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype implemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that MegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to baseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.

### Breaking Diffusion with Cache: Exploiting Approximate Caches in   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Desen Sun, Shuncheng Jie, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T04:46:44Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.

### Rethinking Transformer Connectivity: TLinFormer, A Path to Exact, Full   Context-Aware Linear Attention
**Authors**: Zhongpan Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T04:10:19Z

**Summary**: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency}, \textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yue Song, Dawei Yang, Qiang Wu, Yan Yan, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T03:57:52Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

### Climber: Toward Efficient Scaling Laws for Large Recommendation Models
**Authors**: Songpei Xu, Shijia Wang, Da Guo, Xianwen Guo, Qiang Xiao, Bin Huang, Guanlin Wu, Chuanjiang Luo

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T01:40:30Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based generative models have achieved remarkable success across domains with various scaling law manifestations. However, our extensive experiments reveal persistent challenges when applying Transformer to recommendation systems: (1) Transformer scaling is not ideal with increased computational resources, due to structural incompatibilities with recommendation-specific features such as multi-source data heterogeneity; (2) critical online inference latency constraints (tens of milliseconds) that intensify with longer user behavior sequences and growing computational demands. We propose Climber, an efficient recommendation framework comprising two synergistic components: the model architecture for efficient scaling and the co-designed acceleration techniques. Our proposed model adopts two core innovations: (1) multi-scale sequence extraction that achieves a time complexity reduction by a constant factor, enabling more efficient scaling with sequence length; (2) dynamic temperature modulation adapting attention distributions to the multi-scenario and multi-behavior patterns. Complemented by acceleration techniques, Climber achieves a 5.15$\times$ throughput gain without performance degradation by adopting a "single user, multiple item" batched processing and memory-efficient Key-Value caching. Comprehensive offline experiments on multiple datasets validate that Climber exhibits a more ideal scaling curve. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented framework where controlled model scaling drives continuous online metric growth (12.19\% overall lift) without prohibitive resource costs. Climber has been successfully deployed on Netease Cloud Music, one of China's largest music streaming platforms, serving tens of millions of users daily.

### AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and   High-Quality Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Shaoting Feng, Hanchen Li, Kuntai Du, Zhuohan Gu, Yuhan Liu, Jiayi Yao, Siddhant Ray, Samuel Shen, Yihua Cheng, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T00:46:51Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.   However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

### DRR-MDPF: A Queue Management Strategy Based on Dynamic Resource   Allocation and Markov Decision Process in Named Data Networking (NDN)
**Authors**: Fatemeh Roshanzadeh, Hamid Barati, Ali Barati

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T21:05:05Z

**Summary**: Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a transformative shift in network architecture, prioritizing content names over host addresses to enhance data dissemination. Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN performance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper introduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov Decision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR) algorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding decisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of unsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation among competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a learning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback and probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that DRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF, RFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest Satisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load balancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and heavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational complexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric decision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading to optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent, adaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively addressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and route optimization in dynamic networking environments.

### SpeedMalloc: Improving Multi-threaded Applications via a Lightweight   Core for Memory Allocation
**Authors**: Ruihao Li, Qinzhe Wu, Krishna Kavi, Gayatri Mehta, Jonathan C. Beard, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar, Lizy K. John

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T20:18:37Z

**Summary**: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately 5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead. Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators remains a significant challenge.   We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

### MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG
**Authors**: Rahul Anand

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T17:45:16Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T16:34:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.   A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

### Re-thinking Memory-Bound Limitations in CGRAs
**Authors**: Xiangfeng Liu, Zhe Jiang, Anzhen Zhu, Xiaomeng Han, Mingsong Lyu, Qingxu Deng, Nan Guan

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T12:13:45Z

**Summary**: Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to 6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.

### ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient   Diffusion
**Authors**: Xurui Peng, Hong Liu, Chenqian Yan, Rui Ma, Fangmin Chen, Xing Wang, Zhihua Wu, Songwei Liu, Mingbao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T10:37:24Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### Beyond the Bermuda Triangle of Contention: IOMMU Interference in Mixed   Criticality Systems
**Authors**: Diogo Costa, Jose Martins, Sandro Pinto

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T08:30:33Z

**Summary**: As Mixed Criticality Systems (MCSs) evolve, they increasingly integrate heterogeneous computing platforms, combining general-purpose processors with specialized accelerators such as AI engines, GPUs, and high-speed networking interfaces. This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and DMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory. Consequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such environments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating memory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation and access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related side-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in performance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same architectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs, caching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing unpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU structures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how their shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that IOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where translation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we hypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar behavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as prefetching and hierarchical TLB structures. Notably, our experiments show that IOMMU interference can delay DMA transactions by up to 1.79x for lower-size transfers on the Arm SMMUv2 implementation.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T04:58:58Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### VoxHammer: Training-Free Precise and Coherent 3D Editing in Native 3D   Space
**Authors**: Lin Li, Zehuan Huang, Haoran Feng, Gengxiong Zhuang, Rui Chen, Chunchao Guo, Lu Sheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T17:59:47Z

**Summary**: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at https://huanngzh.github.io/VoxHammer-Page/.

### Enabling MoE on the Edge via Importance-Driven Expert Scheduling
**Authors**: Guoying Zhu, Meng Li, Haipeng Dai, Xuechen Liu, Weijun Wang, Keran Li, Jun xiao, Ligeng Chen, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T12:32:09Z

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query. Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer, while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy.

### Rethinking Caching for LLM Serving Systems: Beyond Traditional   Heuristics
**Authors**: Jungwoo Kim, Minsang Kim, Jaeheon Lee, Chanwoo Moon, Heejin Kim, Taeho Hwang, Woosuk Chung, Yeseong Kim, Sungjin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T07:09:09Z

**Summary**: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints. Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to 1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

### Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with   Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing
**Authors**: Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Ting Cai, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T01:55:27Z

**Summary**: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.   We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

### AGILE: Lightweight and Efficient Asynchronous GPU-SSD Integration
**Authors**: Zhuoping Yang, Jinming Zhuang, Xingzhen Chen, Alex K. Jones, Peipei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T01:45:34Z

**Summary**: GPUs are critical for compute-intensive applications, yet emerging workloads such as recommender systems, graph analytics, and data analytics often exceed GPU memory capacity. Existing solutions allow GPUs to use CPU DRAM or SSDs as external memory, and the GPU-centric approach enables GPU threads to directly issue NVMe requests, further avoiding CPU intervention. However, current GPU-centric approaches adopt synchronous I/O, forcing threads to stall during long communication delays.   We propose AGILE, a lightweight asynchronous GPU-centric I/O library that eliminates deadlock risks and integrates a flexible HBM-based software cache. AGILE overlaps computation and I/O, improving performance by up to 1.88$\times$ across workloads with diverse computation-to-communication ratios. Compared to BaM on DLRM, AGILE achieves up to 1.75$\times$ speedup through efficient design and overlapping; on graph applications, AGILE reduces software cache overhead by up to 3.12$\times$ and NVMe I/O overhead by up to 2.85$\times$; AGILE also lowers per-thread register usage by up to 1.32$\times$.

### Strata: Hierarchical Context Caching for Long Context Language Model   Serving
**Authors**: Zhiqiang Xie, Ziyi Xu, Mark Zhao, Yuwei An, Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Scott Mahlke, Michael Garland, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T00:09:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanding context windows face significant performance hurdles. While caching key-value (KV) states is critical for avoiding redundant computation, the storage footprint of long-context caches quickly exceeds GPU memory capacity, forcing production systems to adopt hierarchical caching across memory hierarchies. However, transferring large cached contexts back to the GPU introduces severe performance bottlenecks: fragmented I/O from paged layouts prevents full bandwidth utilization, and existing schedulers fail to account for cache-loading delays, leaving systems loading-bound rather than compute-bound. We present Strata, a hierarchical context caching framework designed for efficient long context LLM serving. Strata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to combat KV cache fragmentation, decoupling GPU and CPU memory layouts and employs cache-aware request scheduling to balance compute with I/O latency and overlapping unavoidable stalls with complementary tasks. Built on SGLang and deployed in production, Strata achieves up to 5x lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to vLLM + LMCache and 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on long-context benchmarks, without degrading short-context performance.

### Real-time 3D Visualization of Radiance Fields on Light Field Displays
**Authors**: Jonghyun Kim, Cheng Sun, Michael Stengel, Matthew Chan, Andrew Russell, Jaehyun Jung, Wil Braithwaite, Shalini De Mello, David Luebke

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T22:21:04Z

**Summary**: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

### DiskJoin: Large-scale Vector Similarity Join with SSD
**Authors**: Yanqi Chen, Xiao Yan, Alexandra Meliou, Eric Lo

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T21:07:52Z

**Summary**: Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin, the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.

### MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory   Augmentation and Scalable Complexity
**Authors**: Xiao Lv, Jiangxia Cao, Shijie Guan, Xiaoyou Zhou, Zhiguang Qi, Yaqiang Zang, Ming Li, Ben Wang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T15:48:28Z

**Summary**: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

### ILRe: Intermediate Layer Retrieval for Context Compression in Causal   Language Models
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, Mandi Liu, Jiangzhou Ji, Huaijun Li, Haobo Yang, Yaohan He, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T10:59:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

**Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

### OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free   Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models
**Authors**: Huanpeng Chu, Wei Wu, Guanyu Fen, Yutao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T03:07:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.

### ExpertWeave: Efficiently Serving Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuned Adapters   at Scale
**Authors**: Ge Shi, Hanieh Sadri, Qian Wang, Yu Zhang, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T03:05:16Z

**Summary**: Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning (ESFT) adapts Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models to enhance their task-specific performance by selectively tuning the top-activated experts for the task. Serving these fine-tuned models at scale is challenging: deploying merged models in isolation is prohibitively resource-hungry, while existing multi-adapter serving systems with LoRA-style additive updates are incompatible with ESFT's expert-oriented paradigm. We present ExpertWeave, a system that serves multiple ESFT adapters concurrently over a single shared MoE base model, drastically reducing the memory footprint and improving resource utilization. To seamlessly integrate into existing inference pipelines for MoE models with non-intrusive modifications and minimal latency overhead, ExpertWeave introduces a virtual-memory-assisted expert weight manager that co-locates base-model and adapter experts without incurring memory overhead from fragmentation, and a fused kernel for batched rerouting to enable lightweight redirection of tokens to the appropriate experts at runtime. Our evaluations show that ExpertWeave can simultaneously serve multiple adapters of a 16B MoE model on a single accelerator where the baseline runs out of memory, or provides up to 94x more KV cache capacity and achieves up to 18% higher throughput while using comparable resources, all without compromising model accuracy. ExpertWeave maintains low overhead even when scaling to 20 adapters, with a 4-11% latency increase compared with serving the base model alone. Source code will be released soon.

### Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for   Accelerating Talking Head Generation
**Authors**: Jianzhi Long, Wenhao Sun, Rongcheng Tu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T02:58:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

### TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated   Prefill and Decode Inference
**Authors**: Xiaojuan Tang, Fanxu Meng, Pingzhi Tang, Yuxuan Wang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T02:24:20Z

**Summary**: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

**Summary**: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs

**Authors**: Muhammad Taha Cheema, Abeer Aamir, Khawaja Gul Muhammad, Naveed Anwar Bhatti, Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, Zafar Ayyub Qazi

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs   for Text Annotation
**Authors**: Joachim Baumann, Paul Röttger, Aleksandra Urman, Albert Wendsjö, Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Johannes B. Gruber, Dirk Hovy

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:58:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.   We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.   Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.

### Building High-Quality Datasets for Portuguese LLMs: From Common Crawl   Snapshots to Industrial-Grade Corpora
**Authors**: Thales Sales Almeida, Rodrigo Nogueira, Helio Pedrini

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:58:23Z

**Summary**: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines, including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering insights for multilingual LLM development.

### A Survey of TinyML Applications in Beekeeping for Hive Monitoring and   Management
**Authors**: Willy Sucipto, Jianlong Zhou, Ray Seung Min Kwon, Fang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:53:39Z

**Summary**: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints. Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven, and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator management.

### Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing
**Authors**: Sai Sundaresan, Harshita Chopra, Atanu R. Sinha, Koustava Goswami, Nagasai Saketh Naidu, Raghav Karan, N Anushka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:51:03Z

**Summary**: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.

### Teamwork as Linear Interpersonal Dynamics
**Authors**: Andrew Jun Lee, Grace Qiyuan Miao, Rick Dale, Alexia Galati, Hongjing Lu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:44:04Z

**Summary**: Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member's past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.

### Evaluating LLMs Without Oracle Feedback: Agentic Annotation Evaluation   Through Unsupervised Consistency Signals
**Authors**: Cheng Chen, Haiyan Yin, Ivor Tsang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:42:41Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators. However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

### Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications:   Retrieval-Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge
**Authors**: Mohammad Saqib Hasan, Sayontan Ghosh, Dhruv Verma, Geoff Kuenning, Erez Zadok, Scott A. Smolka, Niranjan Balasubramanian

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:41:08Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.

### Scaling Truth: The Confidence Paradox in AI Fact-Checking
**Authors**: Ihsan A. Qazi, Zohaib Khan, Abdullah Ghani, Agha A. Raza, Zafar A. Qazi, Wassay Sajjad, Ayesha Ali, Asher Javaid, Muhammad Abdullah Sohail, Abdul H. Azeemi

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:36:25Z

**Summary**: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

### Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations
**Authors**: Daniele Barolo, Chiara Valentin, Fariba Karimi, Luis Galárraga, Gonzalo G. Méndez, Lisette Espín-Noboa

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:27:44Z

**Summary**: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.

### Doubly robust average treatment effect estimation for survival data
**Authors**: Byeonghee Lee, Joonsung Kang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:15:46Z

**Summary**: Considering censored outcomes in survival analysis can lead to quite complex results in the model setting of causal inference. Causal inference has attracted a lot of attention over the past few years, but little research has been done on survival analysis. Even for the only research conducted, the machine learning method was considered assuming a large sample, which is not suitable in that the actual data are high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) method. Therefore, penalty is considered for numerous covariates, and the relationship between these covariates and treatment variables is reflected as a covariate balancing property score (CBPS). It also considers censored results. To this end, we will try to solve the above-mentioned problems by using penalized empirical likelihood, which considers both estimating equation and penalty. The proposed average treatment effect (ATE) estimator possesses the oracle property, exhibiting key characteristics such as double robustness for unbiasedness, sparsity in model selection, and asymptotic normality.

### Introducing RobustiPy: An efficient next generation multiversal library   with model selection, averaging, resampling, and explainable artificial   intelligence
**Authors**: Daniel Valdenegro Ibarra, Jiani Yan, Duiyi Dai, Charles Rahal

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:13:59Z

**Summary**: Scientific inference is often undermined by the vast but rarely explored "multiverse" of defensible modelling choices, which can generate results as variable as the phenomena under study. We introduce RobustiPy, an open-source Python library that systematizes multiverse analysis and model-uncertainty quantification at scale. RobustiPy unifies bootstrap-based inference, combinatorial specification search, model selection and averaging, joint-inference routines, and explainable AI methods within a modular, reproducible framework. Beyond exhaustive specification curves, it supports rigorous out-of-sample validation and quantifies the marginal contribution of each covariate. We demonstrate its utility across five simulation designs and ten empirical case studies spanning economics, sociology, psychology, and medicine, including a re-analysis of widely cited findings with documented discrepancies. Benchmarking on ~672 million simulated regressions shows that RobustiPy delivers state-of-the-art computational efficiency while expanding transparency in empirical research. By standardizing and accelerating robustness analysis, RobustiPy transforms how researchers interrogate sensitivity across the analytical multiverse, offering a practical foundation for more reproducible and interpretable computational science.

### Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation
**Authors**: Hyeonho Jeong, Suhyeon Lee, Jong Chul Ye

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:59:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page: https://hyeonho99.github.io/reangle-a-video/

### SocialNav-SUB: Benchmarking VLMs for Scene Understanding in Social Robot   Navigation
**Authors**: Michael J. Munje, Chen Tang, Shuijing Liu, Zichao Hu, Yifeng Zhu, Jiaxun Cui, Garrett Warnell, Joydeep Biswas, Peter Stone

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:47:00Z

**Summary**: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be found at https://larg.github.io/socialnav-sub .

### AgentGym-RL: Training LLM Agents for Long-Horizon Decision Making   through Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zhiheng Xi, Jixuan Huang, Chenyang Liao, Baodai Huang, Honglin Guo, Jiaqi Liu, Rui Zheng, Junjie Ye, Jiazheng Zhang, Wenxiang Chen, Wei He, Yiwen Ding, Guanyu Li, Zehui Chen, Zhengyin Du, Xuesong Yao, Yufei Xu, Jiecao Chen, Tao Gui, Zuxuan Wu, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:46:11Z

**Summary**: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.

### MPO: Boosting LLM Agents with Meta Plan Optimization
**Authors**: Weimin Xiong, Yifan Song, Qingxiu Dong, Bingchan Zhao, Feifan Song, Xun Wang, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:45:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.

### GPU-accelerated LISA parameter estimation with full time domain response
**Authors**: Cecilio García-Quirós, Shubhanshu Tiwari, Stanislav Babak

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:43:45Z

**Summary**: We conduct the first full Bayesian inference analysis for LISA parameter estimation incorporating the effects of subdominant harmonics and spin-precession through a full time domain response. The substantial computational demands of using time domain waveforms for LISA are significantly mitigated by implementing a novel Python version of the IMRPhenomT family of waveform models and the LISA response with GPU acceleration. This time domain response alleviates the theoretical necessity of developing specific transfer functions to approximate the LISA response in the Fourier domain for each specific type of system and allows for the use of unequal arms configurations and realistic LISA orbits. Our analysis includes a series of zero-noise injections for a Massive Black Hole Binary with aligned and precessing spins. We investigate the impact of including subdominant harmonics, compare equal and unequal arm configurations, and analyze different Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) configurations. We utilize full and uniform priors, with a lower frequency cutoff of 0.1mHz, and a signal duration of approximately two months, sampled every 5 seconds. The sampler is initialized based on Fisher estimates. Our results demonstrate LISA capability to measure the two spin magnitudes and the primary spin tilt angle, alongside sky localization, with percent-level precision, while component masses are determined with sub-percent accuracy.

### Streaming Sequence-to-Sequence Learning with Delayed Streams Modeling
**Authors**: Neil Zeghidour, Eugene Kharitonov, Manu Orsini, Václav Volhejn, Gabriel de Marmiesse, Edouard Grave, Patrick Pérez, Laurent Mazaré, Alexandre Défossez

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:43:01Z

**Summary**: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep. Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream. DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks, showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/delayed-streams-modeling

### Learning Turbulent Flows with Generative Models: Super-resolution,   Forecasting, and Sparse Flow Reconstruction
**Authors**: Vivek Oommen, Siavash Khodakarami, Aniruddha Bora, Zhicheng Wang, George Em Karniadakis

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:42:22Z

**Summary**: Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and computational fluid mechanics.

### Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to MCP Servers for   Tool-Augmented LLMs
**Authors**: Meriem Mastouri, Emna Ksontini, Wael Kessentini

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:33:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate.   This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling.   We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success.   Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:24:08Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies: knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage, LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms. Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts. This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical discovery.

### Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models
**Authors**: Willa Potosnak, Cristian Challu, Mononito Goswami, Kin G. Olivares, Michał Wiliński, Nina Żukowska, Artur Dubrawski

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:22:20Z

**Summary**: Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.

### X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S: Automated Discovery of Multi-turn to   Single-turn Jailbreak Templates
**Authors**: Hyunjun Kim, Junwoo Ha, Sangyoon Yu, Haon Park

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:17:44Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution. The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.   Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta = 0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and 44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of 2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.   Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

### Securing Cryptographic Software via Typed Assembly Language (Extended   Version)
**Authors**: Shixin Song, Tingzhen Dong, Kosi Nwabueze, Julian Zanders, Andres Erbsen, Adam Chlipala, Mengjia Yan

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:17:31Z

**Summary**: Authors of cryptographic software are well aware that their code should not leak secrets through its timing behavior, and, until 2018, they believed that following industry-standard constant-time coding guidelines was sufficient. However, the revelation of the Spectre family of speculative execution attacks injected new complexities.   To block speculative attacks, prior work has proposed annotating the program's source code to mark secret data, with hardware using this information to decide when to speculate (i.e., when only public values are involved) or not (when secrets are in play). While these solutions are able to track secret information stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them from correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance.   This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites assembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack. By moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to address limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this assembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the lengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new variant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address this challenge. Assembly rewriting is driven by compile-time inference within Octal. We apply our technique to cryptographic programs and demonstrate that it enables secure speculation efficiently, incurring a low average overhead of $1.2\%$.

### SWE-Mirror: Scaling Issue-Resolving Datasets by Mirroring Issues Across   Repositories
**Authors**: Junhao Wang, Daoguang Zan, Shulin Xin, Siyao Liu, Yurong Wu, Kai Shen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:15:23Z

**Summary**: Creating large-scale verifiable training datasets for issue-resolving tasks is a critical yet notoriously difficult challenge. Existing methods on automating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from low success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within existing Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported problems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and also the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce SWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence, mirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and re-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing Gym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on GitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable tasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have curated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value of our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale. Post-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit improvements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the dataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the OpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on SWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and validates the effectiveness of our approach.

### Sharing is Caring: Efficient LM Post-Training with Collective RL   Experience Sharing

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:14:20Z

**Summary**: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability) alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired. As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments. We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse hardware and models during an open-source demo.

### LESER: Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement in   e-Commerce
**Authors**: Yipeng Zhang, Bowen Liu, Xiaoshuang Zhang, Aritra Mandal, Canran Xu, Zhe Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:11:13Z

**Summary**: User queries in e-commerce search are often vague, short, and underspecified, making it difficult for retrieval systems to match them accurately against structured product catalogs. This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many nature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing needs. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based LLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture nuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints, and rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel framework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine feedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval optimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn directly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over search results and produce high quality query expansions that align with platform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale, real-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both offline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances semantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in user engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search systems.

### Teaching an Old LLM Secure Coding: Localized Preference Optimization on   Distilled Preferences
**Authors**: Mohammad Saqib Hasan, Saikat Chakraborty, Santu Karmaker, Niranjan Balasubramanian

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:01:21Z

**Summary**: LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in code insecurity while also improving overall code quality. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/disco-lpo.

### REGen: A Reliable Evaluation Framework for Generative Event Argument   Extraction
**Authors**: Omar Sharif, Joseph Gatto, Madhusudan Basak, Sarah M. Preum

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:49:00Z

**Summary**: Event argument extraction identifies arguments for predefined event roles in text. Existing work evaluates this task with exact match (EM), where predicted arguments must align exactly with annotated spans. While suitable for span-based models, this approach falls short for large language models (LLMs), which often generate diverse yet semantically accurate arguments. EM severely underestimates performance by disregarding valid variations. Furthermore, EM evaluation fails to capture implicit arguments (unstated but inferable) and scattered arguments (distributed across a document). These limitations underscore the need for an evaluation framework that better captures models' actual performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce REGen, a Reliable Evaluation framework for Generative event argument extraction. REGen combines the strengths of exact, relaxed, and LLM-based matching to better align with human judgment. Experiments on six datasets show that REGen reveals an average performance gain of +23.93 F1 over EM, reflecting capabilities overlooked by prior evaluation. Human validation further confirms REGen's effectiveness, achieving 87.67% alignment with human assessments of argument correctness.

### MM-DREX: Multimodal-Driven Dynamic Routing of LLM Experts for Financial   Trading
**Authors**: Yang Chen, Yueheng Jiang, Zhaozhao Ma, Yuchen Cao, Jacky Keung, Kun Kuang, Leilei Gan, Yiquan Wu, Fei Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:45:41Z

**Summary**: The inherent non-stationarity of financial markets and the complexity of multi-modal information pose significant challenges to existing quantitative trading models. Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal data struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model (LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from static strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment and fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose MM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on large language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception from strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in non-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language model (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart patterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights; (2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout, positioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3) proposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the router's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted decision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks, futures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly outperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep reinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization. Additionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert behavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.

### Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and   Rigorous Evaluation
**Authors**: Jungkoo Kang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T12:14:20Z

**Summary**: Robust workflow composition is critical for effective agent performance, yet progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is hindered by a scarcity of scalable evaluation data. This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer   Layer Caching
**Authors**: Siratish Sakpiboonchit

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:41:15Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference results can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ .

### LED: LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection without Human Curated   Data Generation
**Authors**: Yang Zhou, Shiyu Zhao, Yuxiao Chen, Zhenting Wang, Can Jin, Dimitris N. Metaxas

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:29:43Z

**Summary**: Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.

### Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for   Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference
**Authors**: Guoqing Ma, Jia Zhu, Hanghui Guo, Weijie Shi, Jiawei Shen, Jingjiang Liu, Yidan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:22:00Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations, are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When, state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

### Decisive Evidence for the First Overtone Mode in the Ringdown Signal of   GW231028
**Authors**: Hai-Tian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:52:49Z

**Summary**: The properties of a remnant black hole can be probed by analyzing the gravitational waves emitted during its ringdown phase. This signal provides a direct test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this study, we apply a time-domain F-statistic framework to the ringdown of GW231028_153006 and find decisive evidence for the presence of the first overtone mode in the signal. The detection of the $\ell|m|n=221$ mode is statistically significant, achieving a Bayes factor of $193$ for an analysis beginning at $10\,M$ after the signal's peak amplitude--a time consistent with the linear perturbation regime. The inclusion of both the fundamental and overtone modes in our model allows for precise constraints on the remnant's properties. We infer a redshifted final mass of $243.0^{+22.7}_{-22.7}\,M_{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.80_{-0.11}^{+0.07}$ (at $90\%$ credibility), derived from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $10.5$. A test of the no-hair theorem, enabled by this two-mode detection, shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity.

### Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute   Implementations
**Authors**: Ron F. Del Rosario, Klaudia Krawiecka, Christian Schroeder de Witt

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:41:07Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.

### Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of   Concept
**Authors**: Ryan James Campbell, Mihalis Mathioudakis, Carlos Quintero Noda

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:40:37Z

**Summary**: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric inversion. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.

### Large Language Models for Mobile GUI Text Input Generation: An Empirical   Study
**Authors**: Chenhui Cui, Tao Li, Junjie Wang, Chunyang Chen, Dave Towey, Rubing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:40:15Z

**Summary**: Mobile applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, making ensuring their quality an important activity. Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is a quality assurance method that has frequently been used for mobile apps. Some GUIs require these text inputs to be able to move from one page to the next. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent text-generation capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been any empirical study to evaluate different pre-trained LLMs' effectiveness at generating text inputs for mobile GUI testing. This paper reports on a large-scale empirical study that extensively investigates the effectiveness of eight state-of-the-art LLMs in Android text-input generation for UI pages. We collected 115 Android apps from Google Play and extracted contextual information from the UI pages to construct prompts for LLMs. The experimental results show that some LLMs can generate more effective and higher-quality text inputs. We conducted an experiment to assess the bug-detection capabilities of LLMs by directly generating invalid text inputs. We also invited professional testers to manually evaluate, modify, and re-create the LLM-generated text inputs. We integrated the text-input generation process into DroidBot to augment its UI-exploration capabilities. Finally, we present several valuable insights regarding the application of LLMs to Android testing, particularly for the generation of text inputs: These insights will benefit the Android testing community.

### Randomly Sampled Language Reasoning Problems Elucidate Limitations of   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Kavi Gupta, Kate Sanders, Armando Solar-Lezama

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:39:59Z

**Summary**: While LLMs have revolutionized the field of machine learning due to their high performance on a strikingly wide range of problems, they are also known to hallucinate false answers and underperform on less canonical versions of the same tasks. There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.

**Summary**: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving an unprecedented increase in the electricity demand of AI data centers, raising emerging challenges for electric power grids. Understanding the characteristics of AI data center loads and their interactions with the grid is therefore critical for ensuring both reliable power system operation and sustainable AI development. This paper provides a comprehensive review and vision of this evolving landscape. Specifically, this paper (i) presents an overview of AI data center infrastructure and its key components, (ii) examines the key characteristics and patterns of electricity demand across the stages of model preparation, training, fine-tuning, and inference, (iii) analyzes the critical challenges that AI data center loads pose to power systems across three interrelated timescales, including long-term planning and interconnection, short-term operation and electricity markets, and real-time dynamics and stability, and (iv) discusses potential solutions from the perspectives of the grid, AI data centers, and AI end-users to address these challenges. By synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions, this review aims to guide research and development in support of the joint advancement of AI data centers and power systems toward reliable, efficient, and sustainable operation.

### Calibrating Transformers via Sparse Gaussian Processes
**Authors**: Wenlong Chen, Yingzhen Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:37:12Z

**Summary**: Transformer models have achieved profound success in prediction tasks in a wide range of applications in natural language processing, speech recognition and computer vision. Extending Transformer's success to safety-critical domains requires calibrated uncertainty estimation which remains under-explored. To address this, we propose Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA), which performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head attention blocks (MHAs) in transformer to calibrate its uncertainty. It replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior processes of MHA outputs. Empirically, on a suite of prediction tasks on text, images and graphs, SGPA-based Transformers achieve competitive predictive accuracy, while noticeably improving both in-distribution calibration and out-of-distribution robustness and detection.

### AutoODD: Agentic Audits via Bayesian Red Teaming in Black-Box Models
**Authors**: Rebecca Martin, Jay Patrikar, Sebastian Scherer

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:33:58Z

**Summary**: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training, are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance. However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

### Sample efficient likelihood-free inference for virus dynamics with   different types of experiments
**Authors**: Yingying Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:32:03Z

**Summary**: This study applied Bayesian optimization likelihood-free inference(BOLFI) to virus dynamics experimental data and efficiently inferred the model parameters with uncertainty measure. The computational benefit is remarkable compared to existing methodology on the same problem. No likelihood knowledge is needed in the inference. Improvement of the BOLFI algorithm with Gaussian process based classifier for treatment of extreme values are provided. Discrepancy design for combining different forms of data from completely different experiment processes are suggested and tested with synthetic data, then applied to real data. Reasonable parameter values are estimated for influenza A virus data.

### UOPSL: Unpaired OCT Predilection Sites Learning for Fundus Image   Diagnosis Augmentation
**Authors**: Zhihao Zhao, Yinzheng Zhao, Junjie Yang, Xiangtong Yao, Quanmin Liang, Daniel Zapp, Kai Huang, Nassir Navab, M. Ali Nasseri

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:19:59Z

**Summary**: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective, the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space. During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing benchmarks.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:17:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile, an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing 5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization. (3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

### Modular PE-Structured Learning for Cross-Task Wireless Communications
**Authors**: Yuxuan Duan, Chenyang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:09:16Z

**Summary**: Recent trends in learning wireless policies attempt to develop deep neural networks (DNNs) for handling multiple tasks with a single model. Existing approaches often rely on large models, which are hard to pre-train and fine-tune at the wireless edge. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by leveraging the structured knowledge of wireless problems -- specifically, permutation equivariant (PE) properties. We design three types of PE-aware modules, two of which are Transformer-style sub-layers. These modules can serve as building blocks to assemble compact DNNs applicable to the wireless policies with various PE properties. To guide the design, we analyze the hypothesis space associated with each PE property, and show that the PE-structured module assembly can boost the learning efficiency. Inspired by the reusability of the modules, we propose PE-MoFormer, a compositional DNN capable of learning a wide range of wireless policies -- including but not limited to precoding, coordinated beamforming, power allocation, and channel estimation -- with strong generalizability, low sample and space complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed modular PE-based framework outperforms relevant large model in both learning efficiency and inference time, offering a new direction for structured cross-task learning for wireless communications.

### Outlier-Robust Multi-Group Gaussian Mixture Modeling with Flexible Group   Reassignment
**Authors**: Patricia Puchhammer, Ines Wilms, Peter Filzmoser

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:05:14Z

**Summary**: Do expert-defined or diagnostically-labeled data groups align with clusters inferred through statistical modeling? If not, where do discrepancies between predefined labels and model-based groupings occur and why? In this work, we show how to address these questions using the multi-group Gaussian mixture model (MG-GMM). This novel model incorporates prior group information while allowing flexibility to reassign observations to alternative groups based on data-driven evidence. We achieve this by modeling the observations of each group as arising not from a single distribution, but from a Gaussian mixture comprising all group-specific distributions. Moreover, our model offers robustness against cellwise outliers that may obscure or distort the underlying group structure. We propose a new penalized likelihood approach, called cellMG-GMM, to jointly estimate mixture probabilities, location and scale parameters of the MG-GMM, and detect outliers through a penalty term on the number of flagged cellwise outliers in the objective function. We show that our estimator has good breakdown properties in presence of cellwise outliers. We develop a computationally-efficient EM-based algorithm for cellMG-GMM, and demonstrate its strong performance in identifying and diagnosing observations at the intersection of multiple groups through simulations and diverse applications in meteorology, medicine and oenology.

### Deciphering the global production network from cross-border firm   transactions
**Authors**: Neave O'Clery, Ben Radcliffe-Brown, Thomas Spencer, Daniel Tarling-Hunter

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:03:00Z

**Summary**: Critical for policy-making and business operations, the study of global supply chains has been severely hampered by a lack of detailed data. Here we harness global firm-level transaction data covering 20m global firms, and 1 billion cross-border transactions, to infer key inputs for over 1200 products. Transforming this data to a directed network, we find that products are clustered into three large groups including textiles, chemicals and food, and machinery and metals. European industrial nations and China dominate critical intermediate products in the network such as metals, common components and tools, while industrial complexity is correlated with embeddedness in densely connected supply chains. To validate the network, we find structural similarities with two alternative product networks, one generated via LLM queries and the other derived by NAFTA to track product origins. We further detect linkages between products identified in manually mapped single sector supply chains, including electric vehicle batteries and semi-conductors. Finally, metrics derived from network structure capturing both forward and backward linkages are able to predict country-product diversification patterns with high accuracy.

### Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth
**Authors**: Yang Wang, Chenghao Xiao, Chia-Yi Hsiao, Zi Yan Chang, Chi-Li Chen, Tyler Loakman, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:02:50Z

**Summary**: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:02:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

### LLM Ensemble for RAG: Role of Context Length in Zero-Shot Question   Answering for BioASQ Challenge
**Authors**: Dima Galat, Diego Molla-Aliod

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:50:49Z

**Summary**: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast, complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

### No-Knowledge Alarms for Misaligned LLMs-as-Judges
**Authors**: Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:46:40Z

**Summary**: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be 100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges. The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability requirement.

### Functional Regression with Nonstationarity and Error Contamination:   Application to the Economic Impact of Climate Change
**Authors**: Kyungsik Nam, Won-Ki Seo

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:45:58Z

**Summary**: This paper studies a functional regression model with nonstationary dependent and explanatory functional observations, in which the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variable, and the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to the evaluation of the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.

### Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the   Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations
**Authors**: Sudhanva Lalit, Alexandra C. Semposki, Joshua M. Maldonado

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:36:23Z

**Summary**: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a new method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). This method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known equations of state (EOSs) with fixed parameters using the SLM, accurately recreating high-fidelity results while achieving a computational speed-up of $\approx 2.4 \times 10^4$. We test our parametric SLM method for a two-parameter quarkyonic EOS against high-fidelity RK4 TOV calculations and find a computational speedup of $\approx 7.0 \times 10^4$. Hence, SLM is an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods employed in this work is openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.

### EfficientIML: Efficient High-Resolution Image Manipulation Localization
**Authors**: Jinhan Li, Haoyang He, Lei Xie, Jiangning Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:32:02Z

**Summary**: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its suitability for real-time forensic applications.

**Authors**: Jie Jiang, Siqi Shen, Haining Xie, Yang Li, Yu Shen, Danqing Huang, Bo Qian, Yinjun Wu, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui, Peng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:22:58Z

**Summary**: SQL queries in real world analytical environments, whether written by humans or generated automatically often suffer from syntax errors, inefficiency, or semantic misalignment, especially in complex OLAP scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback, allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong practical utility and effective performance.

### Pay Attention to Real World Perturbations! Natural Robustness Evaluation   in Machine Reading Comprehension
**Authors**: Yulong Wu, Viktor Schlegel, Riza Batista-Navarro

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:22:08Z

**Summary**: As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life scenarios. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on naturally occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an arteficial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing SQUAD datasets and various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models. More worryingly, these state-of-the-art Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit these errors. Further experiments demonstrate that our findings generalise to natural perturbations found in other more challenging MRC benchmarks. In an effort to mitigate these errors, we show that it is possible to improve the robustness to natural perturbations by training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples, though a noticeable gap still remains compared to performance on unperturbed data.

### Efficient and Generalized end-to-end Autonomous Driving System with   Latent Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations
**Authors**: Zuojin Tang, Xiaoyu Chen, Yongqiang Li, Jianyu Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:18:49Z

**Summary**: An intelligent driving system should dynamically formulate appropriate driving strategies based on the current environment and vehicle status while ensuring system security and reliability. However, methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning often suffer from high sample complexity, poor generalization, and low safety. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an efficient and generalized end-to-end autonomous driving system (EGADS) for complex and varied scenarios. The RL agent in our EGADS combines variational inference with normalizing flows, which are independent of distribution assumptions. This combination allows the agent to capture historical information relevant to driving in latent space effectively, thereby significantly reducing sample complexity. Additionally, we enhance safety by formulating robust safety constraints and improve generalization and performance by integrating RL with expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EGADS significantly reduces sample complexity, greatly improves safety performance, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in complex urban scenarios. Particularly, we contributed an expert dataset collected through human expert steering wheel control, specifically using the G29 steering wheel.

### Inverse Clausius Thermodynamics in Run-and-Tumble Dynamics
**Authors**: Oded Farago

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:07:33Z

**Summary**: We consider a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined by an external potential and coupled to a thermal reservoir. Starting from the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, we derive an explicit expression for the local entropy flux between the system and the heat bath. We then construct a thermodynamic representation of the RTP dynamics, modeling the system as an overdamped particle in a medium with a spatially inhomogeneous effective temperature field, determined directly from the entropy flux. This forms the basis of an Inverse Clausius Thermodynamics framework, in which thermodynamic quantities are inferred from entropy exchange with the heat bath rather than postulated. In addition to an exact expression for the entropy flux, the framework introduces a physically motivated approximation for evaluating the local entropy production rate. The approach is computationally efficient and broadly applicable, and is particularly well suited for RTP models where propulsion velocities are redrawn from a continuous distribution at each tumbling event rather than restricted to discrete states.

### BitROM: Weight Reload-Free CiROM Architecture Towards Billion-Parameter   1.58-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wenlun Zhang, Xinyu Li, Shimpei Ando, Kentaro Yoshioka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:46:29Z

**Summary**: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.

### CM-Align: Consistency-based Multilingual Alignment for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Xue Zhang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Songming Zhang, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:40:49Z

**Summary**: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.

### MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in   Large Video Models
**Authors**: Garry Yang, Zizhe Chen, Man Hon Wong, Haoyu Lei, Yongqiang Chen, Zhenguo Li, Kaiwen Zhou, James Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T11:14:00Z

**Summary**: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.

### How Should We Meta-Learn Reinforcement Learning Algorithms?
**Authors**: Alexander David Goldie, Zilin Wang, Jaron Cohen, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster, Shimon Whiteson

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:25:27Z

**Summary**: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL. However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm. Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as performant as possible.

### Agents of Discovery
**Authors**: Sascha Diefenbacher, Anna Hallin, Gregor Kasieczka, Michael Krämer, Anne Lauscher, Tim Lukas

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:25:13Z

**Summary**: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.

### Ontological Component-based Description of Robot Capabilities
**Authors**: Bastien Dussard, Guillaume Sarthou, Aurélie Clodic

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:20:31Z

**Summary**: A key aspect of a robot's knowledge base is self-awareness about what it is capable of doing. It allows to define which tasks it can be assigned to and which it cannot. We will refer to this knowledge as the Capability concept. As capabilities stems from the components the robot owns, they can be linked together. In this work, we hypothesize that this concept can be inferred from the components rather than merely linked to them. Therefore, we introduce an ontological means of inferring the agent's capabilities based on the components it owns as well as low-level capabilities. This inference allows the agent to acknowledge what it is able to do in a responsive way and it is generalizable to external entities the agent can carry for example. To initiate an action, the robot needs to link its capabilities with external entities. To do so, it needs to infer affordance relations from its capabilities as well as the external entity's dispositions. This work is part of a broader effort to integrate social affordances into a Human-Robot collaboration context and is an extension of an already existing ontology.

### Towards Reliable Generative AI-Driven Scaffolding: Reducing   Hallucinations and Enhancing Quality in Self-Regulated Learning Support
**Authors**: Keyang Qian, Shiqi Liu, Tongguang Li, Mladen Raković, Xinyu Li, Rui Guan, Inge Molenaar, Sadia Nawaz, Zachari Swiecki, Lixiang Yan, Dragan Gašević

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:09:14Z

**Summary**: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds a potential to advance existing educational technologies with capabilities to automatically generate personalised scaffolds that support students' self-regulated learning (SRL). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.

### AutoStub: Genetic Programming-Based Stub Creation for Symbolic Execution
**Authors**: Felix Mächtle, Nils Loose, Jan-Niclas Serr, Jonas Sander, Thomas Eisenbarth

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:08:59Z

**Summary**: Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.

### RoboMatch: A Mobile-Manipulation Teleoperation Platform with   Auto-Matching Network Architecture for Long-Horizon Manipulation
**Authors**: Hanyu Liu, Yunsheng Ma, Jiaxin Huang, Keqiang Ren, Jiayi Wen, Yilin Zheng, Baishu Wan, Pan Li, Jiejun Hou, Haoru Luan, Zhihua Wang, Zhigong Song

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:00:21Z

**Summary**: This paper presents RoboMatch, a novel unified teleoperation platform for mobile manipulation with an auto-matching network architecture, designed to tackle long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments. Our system enhances teleoperation performance, data collection efficiency, task accuracy, and operational stability. The core of RoboMatch is a cockpit-style control interface that enables synchronous operation of the mobile base and dual arms, significantly improving control precision and data collection. Moreover, we introduce the Proprioceptive-Visual Enhanced Diffusion Policy (PVE-DP), which leverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multi-scale visual feature extraction and integrates high-precision IMUs at the end-effector to enrich proprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance. Furthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that decomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns lightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%, increases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon inference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution for complex manipulation tasks.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:56:52Z

**Summary**: We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.

### HuMo: Human-Centric Video Generation via Collaborative Multi-Modal   Conditioning
**Authors**: Liyang Chen, Tianxiang Ma, Jiawei Liu, Bingchuan Li, Zhuowei Chen, Lijie Liu, Xu He, Gen Li, Qian He, Zhiyong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:54:29Z

**Summary**: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text, reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control, we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

### MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and   LLM Spatial Reasoning
**Authors**: Chenghao Liu, Zhimu Zhou, Jiachen Zhang, Minghao Zhang, Songfang Huang, Huiling Duan

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:47:41Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).

### Feedback That Clicks: Introductory Physics Students' Valued Features in   AI Feedback Generated From Self-Crafted and Engineered Prompts
**Authors**: Amogh Sirnoorkar, N. Sanjay Rebello

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:47:27Z

**Summary**: Since the advent of GPT-3.5 in 2022, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous potential in STEM education, particularly in providing real-time, customized feedback to students in large-enrollment courses. A crucial skill that mediates effective use of AI is the systematic structuring of natural language instructions to AI models, commonly referred to as prompt engineering. This study has three objectives: (i) to investigate the sophistication of student-generated prompts when seeking feedback from AI on their arguments, (ii) to examine the features that students value in AI-generated feedback, and (iii) to analyze trends in student preferences for feedback generated from self-crafted prompts versus prompts incorporating prompt engineering techniques and principles of effective feedback. Results indicate that student-generated prompts typically reflect only a subset of foundational prompt engineering techniques. Despite this lack of sophistication, such as incomplete descriptions of task context, AI responses demonstrated contextual intuitiveness by accurately inferring context from the overall content of the prompt. We also identified 12 distinct features that students attribute the usefulness of AI-generated feedback, spanning four broader themes: Evaluation, Content, Presentation, and Depth. Finally, results show that students overwhelmingly prefer feedback generated from structured prompts, particularly those combining prompt engineering techniques with principles of effective feedback. Implications of these results such as integrating the principles of effective feedback in design and delivery of feedback through AI systems, and incorporating prompt engineering in introductory physics courses are discussed.

### Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders for Generative
**Authors**: Alicia Tierz, Jad Mounayer, Beatriz Moya, Francisco Chinesta

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:45:40Z

**Summary**: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent solutions.   To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space, leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients efficiently and accurately.   This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers. Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader engineering applications.

### HumanAgencyBench: Scalable Evaluation of Human Agency Support in AI   Assistants
**Authors**: Benjamin Sturgeon, Daniel Samuelson, Jacob Haimes, Jacy Reese Anthis

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:10:10Z

**Summary**: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI), we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

### Send to which account? Evaluation of an LLM-based Scambaiting System
**Authors**: Hossein Siadati, Haadi Jafarian, Sima Jafarikhah

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:08:52Z

**Summary**: Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on, including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR) of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of automated scambaiting systems.

### HiPhO: How Far Are (M)LLMs from Humans in the Latest High School Physics   Olympiad Benchmark?
**Authors**: Fangchen Yu, Haiyuan Wan, Qianjia Cheng, Yuchen Zhang, Jiacheng Chen, Fujun Han, Yulun Wu, Junchi Yao, Ruilizhen Hu, Ning Ding, Yu Cheng, Tao Chen, Lei Bai, Dongzhan Zhou, Yun Luo, Ganqu Cui, Peng Ye

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:05:31Z

**Summary**: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:03:43Z

**Summary**: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.

### Too Helpful, Too Harmless, Too Honest or Just Right?
**Authors**: Gautam Siddharth Kashyap, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:51:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

### Simulating Identity, Propagating Bias: Abstraction and Stereotypes in   LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Pia Sommerauer, Giulia Rambelli, Tommaso Caselli

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:49:21Z

**Summary**: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

### Acquiescence Bias in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Daniel Braun

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:39:24Z

**Summary**: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or disagreement.

### Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Inversion Learning for Highly Effective NLG   Evaluation Prompts
**Authors**: Hanhua Hong, Chenghao Xiao, Yang Wang, Yiqi Liu, Wenge Rong, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:32:57Z

**Summary**: Evaluating natural language generation systems is challenging due to the diversity of valid outputs. While human evaluation is the gold standard, it suffers from inconsistencies, lack of standardisation, and demographic biases, limiting reproducibility. LLM-based evaluators offer a scalable alternative but are highly sensitive to prompt design, where small variations can lead to significant discrepancies. In this work, we propose an inversion learning method that learns effective reverse mappings from model outputs back to their input instructions, enabling the automatic generation of highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts. Our method requires only a single evaluation sample and eliminates the need for time-consuming manual prompt engineering, thereby improving both efficiency and robustness. Our work contributes toward a new direction for more robust and efficient LLM-based evaluation.

### IssueBench: Millions of Realistic Prompts for Measuring Issue Bias in   LLM Writing Assistance
**Authors**: Paul Röttger, Musashi Hinck, Valentin Hofmann, Kobi Hackenburg, Valentina Pyatkin, Faeze Brahman, Dirk Hovy

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:08:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are helping millions of users write texts about diverse issues, and in doing so expose users to different ideas and perspectives. This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic English-language prompts to measure issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are very similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.

### Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in   High-Energy Physics
**Authors**: Dikshant Sagar, Kaiwen Yu, Alejandro Yankelevich, Jianming Bian, Pierre Baldi

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T13:03:04Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

### VIPER: Visual Perception and Explainable Reasoning for Sequential   Decision-Making
**Authors**: Mohamed Salim Aissi, Clemence Grislain, Mohamed Chetouani, Olivier Sigaud, Laure Soulier, Nicolas Thome

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:57:03Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning on text and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are highly effective for visual perception, applying those models for visual instruction-based planning remains a widely open problem. In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.

### All for law and law for all: Adaptive RAG Pipeline for Legal Research
**Authors**: Figarri Keisha, Prince Singh, Pallavi, Dion Fernandes, Aravindh Manivannan, Ilham Wicaksono, Faisal Ahmad, Wiem Ben Rim

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:50:51Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has transformed how we approach text generation tasks by grounding Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved knowledge. This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.

### CommonVoice-SpeechRE and RPG-MoGe: Advancing Speech Relation Extraction   with a New Dataset and Multi-Order Generative Framework
**Authors**: Jinzhong Ning, Paerhati Tulajiang, Yingying Le, Yijia Zhang, Yuanyuan Sun, Hongfei Lin, Haifeng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:35:43Z

**Summary**: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech. Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research. Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

### MachineLearningLM: Scaling Many-shot In-context Learning via Continued   Pretraining
**Authors**: Haoyu Dong, Pengkun Zhang, Mingzhe Lu, Yanzhen Shen, Guolin Ke

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T09:37:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.   Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.   Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.

### Mixed Dark Matter and Galaxy Clustering: The Importance of Relative   Perturbations
**Authors**: Şafak Çelik, Fabian Schmidt

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:19:54Z

**Summary**: We develop a perturbative model to describe large-scale structure in cosmologies where dark matter consists of a mixture of cold (CDM) and warm (WDM) components. In such mixed dark matter (MDM) scenarios, even a subdominant warm component can introduce distinctive signatures via its free-streaming effects, altering the evolution of density and velocity perturbations. We present linear-order solutions for both total and relative perturbations in the two-fluid system, identifying novel contributions to galaxy bias caused by the relative density and velocity modes between the components. Incorporating these effects into the galaxy bias expansion, we compute the linear galaxy power spectrum in both real and redshift space. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming surveys such as DESI and PFS to MDM scenarios. Our results demonstrate that neglecting relative perturbations can lead to significant biases in inferred constraints on the warm dark matter fraction, particularly for lighter WDM masses ($\lesssim 150~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\lesssim 80~\mathrm{eV}$) for PFS and DESI, respectively. This framework provides a consistent and generalizable approach for incorporating multi-component dark matter dynamics into galaxy clustering analyses.

### LD-ViCE: Latent Diffusion Model for Video Counterfactual Explanations
**Authors**: Payal Varshney, Adriano Lucieri, Christoph Balada, Sheraz Ahmed, Andreas Dengel

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:10:18Z

**Summary**: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

**Summary**: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming analysts with logs requiring rapidly evolving expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.

### Localizing Factual Inconsistencies in Attributable Text Generation
**Authors**: Arie Cattan, Paul Roit, Shiyue Zhang, David Wan, Roee Aharoni, Idan Szpektor, Mohit Bansal, Ido Dagan

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:05:33Z

**Summary**: There has been an increasing interest in detecting hallucinations in model-generated texts, both manually and automatically, at varying levels of granularity. However, most existing methods fail to precisely pinpoint the errors. In this work, we introduce QASemConsistency, a new formalism for localizing factual inconsistencies in attributable text generation, at a fine-grained level. Drawing inspiration from Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, we propose decomposing the generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions, expressed as simple question-answer (QA) pairs, and assess whether each individual QA pair is supported by a trusted reference text. As each QA pair corresponds to a single semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, QASemConsistency effectively localizes the unsupported information. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the QASemConsistency methodology for human annotation, by collecting crowdsourced annotations of granular consistency errors, while achieving a substantial inter-annotator agreement. This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various tasks of attributable text generation. We also show that QASemConsistency yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments. Finally, we implement several methods for automatically detecting localized factual inconsistencies, with both supervised entailment models and LLMs.

**Authors**: Hengjie Cao, Mengyi Chen, Yifeng Yang, Ruijun Huang, Fang Dong, Jixian Zhou, Anrui Chen, Mingzhi Dong, Yujiang Wang, Jinlong Hou, Yuan Cheng, Fan Wu, Fan Yang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu, Li Shang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:04:12Z

**Summary**: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://github.com/sii-research/Metis.

### How Far Are We from Optimal Reasoning Efficiency?
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Gao, Shu Yan, Qixin Tan, Lu Yang, Shusheng Xu, Wei Fu, Zhiyu Mei, Kaifeng Lyu, Yi Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:03:04Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets. Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off, with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach, REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

### AutoVeriFix: Automatically Correcting Errors and Enhancing Functional   Correctness in LLM-Generated Verilog Code
**Authors**: Yan Tan, Xiangchen Meng, Zijun Jiang, Yangdi Lyu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:00:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating software code for high-level programming languages such as Python and C++. However, their application to hardware description languages, such as Verilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. Current approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on syntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address these challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage framework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level Python reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the second stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests that guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations. Simulation discrepancies between the reference model and the Verilog code are iteratively used to identify and correct errors, thereby improving the functional accuracy and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in improving the functional correctness of generated Verilog code.

### An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight   Optimization
**Authors**: Zhuo Xiao, Qinglong Yao, Jingjing Wang, Fugen Zhou, Bo Liu, Haitao Sun, Zhe Ji, Yuliang Jiang, Junjie Wang, Qiuwen Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:54:16Z

**Summary**: Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.

### Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and   Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models
**Authors**: Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Sicheng Liu, Ru Zhang, Zhenjun Li, Bing Zhou, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T05:42:48Z

**Summary**: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:44:57Z

**Summary**: We introduce ubiquitous intelligence as a paradigm where Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve within wireless network-driven ecosystems. Unlike static model deployments, this approach enables scalable and continuous intelligence ascension through coordination between networks and LLMs. Wireless networks support system-orchestrated lifelong learning, while LLMs drive the next-generation network development that is more adaptive and responsive. This co-evolution highlights a shift toward self-improving systems, sustaining capability growth across diverse and resource-constrained environments.

**Summary**: We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. We release code, data, environment, and experiments on https://the-agent-company.com.

**Summary**: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs

**Authors**: Muhammad Taha Cheema, Abeer Aamir, Khawaja Gul Muhammad, Naveed Anwar Bhatti, Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, Zafar Ayyub Qazi

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs   for Text Annotation
**Authors**: Joachim Baumann, Paul Röttger, Aleksandra Urman, Albert Wendsjö, Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Johannes B. Gruber, Dirk Hovy

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:58:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.   We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.   Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.

### Building High-Quality Datasets for Portuguese LLMs: From Common Crawl   Snapshots to Industrial-Grade Corpora
**Authors**: Thales Sales Almeida, Rodrigo Nogueira, Helio Pedrini

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:58:23Z

**Summary**: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines, including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering insights for multilingual LLM development.

### A Survey of TinyML Applications in Beekeeping for Hive Monitoring and   Management
**Authors**: Willy Sucipto, Jianlong Zhou, Ray Seung Min Kwon, Fang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:53:39Z

**Summary**: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints. Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven, and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator management.

### Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing
**Authors**: Sai Sundaresan, Harshita Chopra, Atanu R. Sinha, Koustava Goswami, Nagasai Saketh Naidu, Raghav Karan, N Anushka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:51:03Z

**Summary**: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.

### Evaluating LLMs Without Oracle Feedback: Agentic Annotation Evaluation   Through Unsupervised Consistency Signals
**Authors**: Cheng Chen, Haiyan Yin, Ivor Tsang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:42:41Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators. However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

### A Pathway to Practical Quantum Advantage in Solving Navier-Stokes   Equations

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:40:19Z

**Summary**: The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) promises to tackle classically intractable problems. A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to their high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a full-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for large-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based input/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a refined error-correction protocol. The algorithm achieves an end-to-end exponential speedup in asymptotic complexity, meeting the lower bound for general quantum linear system solvers. Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis and optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical resources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis demonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million physical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days -- outperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a century. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum speedup and the practical deployment of high-performance scientific computing.

### Scaling Truth: The Confidence Paradox in AI Fact-Checking
**Authors**: Ihsan A. Qazi, Zohaib Khan, Abdullah Ghani, Agha A. Raza, Zafar A. Qazi, Wassay Sajjad, Ayesha Ali, Asher Javaid, Muhammad Abdullah Sohail, Abdul H. Azeemi

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:36:25Z

**Summary**: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

### Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations
**Authors**: Daniele Barolo, Chiara Valentin, Fariba Karimi, Luis Galárraga, Gonzalo G. Méndez, Lisette Espín-Noboa

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:27:44Z

**Summary**: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.

**Summary**: Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch, a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world applications.

**Authors**: Asif Newaz, Asif Ur Rahman Adib, Rajit Sahil, Mashfique Mehzad

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:08:31Z

**Summary**: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can support early detection and timely interventions.   Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20 classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a web-based diagnostic tool.   Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions, increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.   Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities, where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection and timely intervention.

### CSI Compression Beyond Latents: End-to-End Hybrid Attention-CNN Networks   with Entropy Regularization
**Authors**: Maryam Ansarifard, Mostafa Rahmani, Mohit K. Sharma, Kishor C. Joshi, George Exarchakos, Alister Burr

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:05:53Z

**Summary**: Massive MIMO systems rely on accurate Channel State Information (CSI) feedback to enable high-gain beam-forming. However, the feedback overhead scales linearly with the number of antennas, presenting a major bottleneck. While recent deep learning methods have improved CSI compression, most overlook the impact of quantization and entropy coding, limiting their practical deployability. In this work, we propose an end-to-end CSI compression framework that integrates a Spatial Correlation-Guided Attention Mechanism with quantization and entropy-aware training. Our model effectively exploits the spatial correlation among the antennas, thereby learning compact, entropy-optimized latent representations for efficient coding. This reduces the required feedback bitrates without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy, thereby yielding a superior rate-distortion trade-off. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing end-to-end CSI compression schemes, exceeding benchmark performance by an average of 21.5% on indoor datasets and 18.9% on outdoor datasets. The proposed framework results in a practical and efficient CSI feedback scheme.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:46:11Z

**Summary**: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.

### MPO: Boosting LLM Agents with Meta Plan Optimization
**Authors**: Weimin Xiong, Yifan Song, Qingxiu Dong, Bingchan Zhao, Feifan Song, Xun Wang, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:45:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.

### Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to MCP Servers for   Tool-Augmented LLMs
**Authors**: Meriem Mastouri, Emna Ksontini, Wael Kessentini

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:33:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate.   This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling.   We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success.   Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.

### ChemBOMAS: Accelerated BO in Chemistry with LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent   System
**Authors**: Dong Han, Zhehong Ai, Pengxiang Cai, Shuzhou Sun, Shanya Lu, Jianpeng Chen, Ben Gao, Lingli Ge, Weida Wang, Xiangxin Zhou, Xihui Liu, Mao Su, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai, Dongzhan Zhou, Tao XU, Yuqiang Li, Shufei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:24:08Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies: knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage, LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms. Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts. This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical discovery.

### Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models
**Authors**: Willa Potosnak, Cristian Challu, Mononito Goswami, Kin G. Olivares, Michał Wiliński, Nina Żukowska, Artur Dubrawski

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:22:20Z

**Summary**: Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.

### X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S: Automated Discovery of Multi-turn to   Single-turn Jailbreak Templates
**Authors**: Hyunjun Kim, Junwoo Ha, Sangyoon Yu, Haon Park

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:17:44Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution. The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.   Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta = 0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and 44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of 2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.   Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

### SWE-Mirror: Scaling Issue-Resolving Datasets by Mirroring Issues Across   Repositories
**Authors**: Junhao Wang, Daoguang Zan, Shulin Xin, Siyao Liu, Yurong Wu, Kai Shen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:15:23Z

**Summary**: Creating large-scale verifiable training datasets for issue-resolving tasks is a critical yet notoriously difficult challenge. Existing methods on automating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from low success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within existing Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported problems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and also the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce SWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence, mirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and re-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing Gym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on GitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable tasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have curated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value of our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale. Post-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit improvements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the dataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the OpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on SWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and validates the effectiveness of our approach.

### LESER: Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement in   e-Commerce
**Authors**: Yipeng Zhang, Bowen Liu, Xiaoshuang Zhang, Aritra Mandal, Canran Xu, Zhe Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:11:13Z

**Summary**: User queries in e-commerce search are often vague, short, and underspecified, making it difficult for retrieval systems to match them accurately against structured product catalogs. This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many nature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing needs. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based LLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture nuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints, and rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel framework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine feedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval optimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn directly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over search results and produce high quality query expansions that align with platform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale, real-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both offline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances semantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in user engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search systems.

### BcQLM: Efficient Vision-Language Understanding with Distilled Q-Gated   Cross-Modal Fusion
**Authors**: Sike Xiang, Shuang Chen, Amir Atapour-Abarghouei

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:09:49Z

**Summary**: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency, computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall, our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM (BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source code is available at https://github.com/thico0224/BcQLM.

### Teaching an Old LLM Secure Coding: Localized Preference Optimization on   Distilled Preferences
**Authors**: Mohammad Saqib Hasan, Saikat Chakraborty, Santu Karmaker, Niranjan Balasubramanian

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T16:01:21Z

**Summary**: LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in code insecurity while also improving overall code quality. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/disco-lpo.

### REGen: A Reliable Evaluation Framework for Generative Event Argument   Extraction
**Authors**: Omar Sharif, Joseph Gatto, Madhusudan Basak, Sarah M. Preum

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:49:00Z

**Summary**: Event argument extraction identifies arguments for predefined event roles in text. Existing work evaluates this task with exact match (EM), where predicted arguments must align exactly with annotated spans. While suitable for span-based models, this approach falls short for large language models (LLMs), which often generate diverse yet semantically accurate arguments. EM severely underestimates performance by disregarding valid variations. Furthermore, EM evaluation fails to capture implicit arguments (unstated but inferable) and scattered arguments (distributed across a document). These limitations underscore the need for an evaluation framework that better captures models' actual performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce REGen, a Reliable Evaluation framework for Generative event argument extraction. REGen combines the strengths of exact, relaxed, and LLM-based matching to better align with human judgment. Experiments on six datasets show that REGen reveals an average performance gain of +23.93 F1 over EM, reflecting capabilities overlooked by prior evaluation. Human validation further confirms REGen's effectiveness, achieving 87.67% alignment with human assessments of argument correctness.

### MM-DREX: Multimodal-Driven Dynamic Routing of LLM Experts for Financial   Trading
**Authors**: Yang Chen, Yueheng Jiang, Zhaozhao Ma, Yuchen Cao, Jacky Keung, Kun Kuang, Leilei Gan, Yiquan Wu, Fei Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:45:41Z

**Summary**: The inherent non-stationarity of financial markets and the complexity of multi-modal information pose significant challenges to existing quantitative trading models. Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal data struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model (LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from static strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment and fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose MM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on large language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception from strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in non-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language model (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart patterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights; (2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout, positioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3) proposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the router's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted decision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks, futures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly outperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep reinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization. Additionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert behavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.

### TANGO: Traversability-Aware Navigation with Local Metric Control for   Topological Goals
**Authors**: Stefan Podgorski, Sourav Garg, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Lachlan Mares, Feras Dayoub, Ian Reid

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:43:32Z

**Summary**: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is made publicly available: https://github.com/podgorki/TANGO.

### Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and   Rigorous Evaluation
**Authors**: Jungkoo Kang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T12:14:20Z

**Summary**: Robust workflow composition is critical for effective agent performance, yet progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is hindered by a scarcity of scalable evaluation data. This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

### LED: LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection without Human Curated   Data Generation
**Authors**: Yang Zhou, Shiyu Zhao, Yuxiao Chen, Zhenting Wang, Can Jin, Dimitris N. Metaxas

**Summary**: Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.

### Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for   Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference
**Authors**: Guoqing Ma, Jia Zhu, Hanghui Guo, Weijie Shi, Jiawei Shen, Jingjiang Liu, Yidan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:22:00Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations, are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When, state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

### Universal Graph Learning for Power System Reconfigurations: Transfer   Across Topology Variations
**Authors**: Tong Wu, Anna Scaglione, Sandy Miguel, Daniel Arnold

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:09:01Z

**Summary**: This work addresses a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to power systems: developing neural network models that transfer across significant system changes, including networks with entirely different topologies and dimensionalities, without requiring training data from unseen reconfigurations. Despite extensive research, most ML-based approaches remain system-specific, limiting real-world deployment. This limitation stems from a dual barrier. First, topology changes shift feature distributions and alter input dimensions due to power flow physics. Second, reconfigurations redefine output semantics and dimensionality, requiring models to handle configuration-specific outputs while maintaining transferable feature extraction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Universal Graph Convolutional Network (UGCN) that achieves transferability to any reconfiguration or variation of existing power systems without any prior knowledge of new grid topologies or retraining during implementation. Our approach applies to both transmission and distribution networks and demonstrates generalization capability to completely unseen system reconfigurations, such as network restructuring and major grid expansions. Experimental results across power system applications, including false data injection detection and state forecasting, show that UGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-system zero-shot transferability of new reconfigurations.

### Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute   Implementations
**Authors**: Ron F. Del Rosario, Klaudia Krawiecka, Christian Schroeder de Witt

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:41:07Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.

### Large Language Models for Mobile GUI Text Input Generation: An Empirical   Study
**Authors**: Chenhui Cui, Tao Li, Junjie Wang, Chunyang Chen, Dave Towey, Rubing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:40:15Z

**Summary**: Mobile applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, making ensuring their quality an important activity. Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is a quality assurance method that has frequently been used for mobile apps. Some GUIs require these text inputs to be able to move from one page to the next. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent text-generation capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been any empirical study to evaluate different pre-trained LLMs' effectiveness at generating text inputs for mobile GUI testing. This paper reports on a large-scale empirical study that extensively investigates the effectiveness of eight state-of-the-art LLMs in Android text-input generation for UI pages. We collected 115 Android apps from Google Play and extracted contextual information from the UI pages to construct prompts for LLMs. The experimental results show that some LLMs can generate more effective and higher-quality text inputs. We conducted an experiment to assess the bug-detection capabilities of LLMs by directly generating invalid text inputs. We also invited professional testers to manually evaluate, modify, and re-create the LLM-generated text inputs. We integrated the text-input generation process into DroidBot to augment its UI-exploration capabilities. Finally, we present several valuable insights regarding the application of LLMs to Android testing, particularly for the generation of text inputs: These insights will benefit the Android testing community.

### Randomly Sampled Language Reasoning Problems Elucidate Limitations of   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Kavi Gupta, Kate Sanders, Armando Solar-Lezama

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:39:59Z

**Summary**: While LLMs have revolutionized the field of machine learning due to their high performance on a strikingly wide range of problems, they are also known to hallucinate false answers and underperform on less canonical versions of the same tasks. There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.

### AutoODD: Agentic Audits via Bayesian Red Teaming in Black-Box Models
**Authors**: Rebecca Martin, Jay Patrikar, Sebastian Scherer

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:33:58Z

**Summary**: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training, are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance. However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

### AdsQA: Towards Advertisement Video Understanding
**Authors**: Xinwei Long, Kai Tian, Peng Xu, Guoli Jia, Jingxuan Li, Sa Yang, Yihua Shao, Kaiyan Zhang, Che Jiang, Hao Xu, Yang Liu, Jiaheng Ma, Bowen Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:17:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile, an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing 5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization. (3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

### Deciphering the global production network from cross-border firm   transactions
**Authors**: Neave O'Clery, Ben Radcliffe-Brown, Thomas Spencer, Daniel Tarling-Hunter

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:03:00Z

**Summary**: Critical for policy-making and business operations, the study of global supply chains has been severely hampered by a lack of detailed data. Here we harness global firm-level transaction data covering 20m global firms, and 1 billion cross-border transactions, to infer key inputs for over 1200 products. Transforming this data to a directed network, we find that products are clustered into three large groups including textiles, chemicals and food, and machinery and metals. European industrial nations and China dominate critical intermediate products in the network such as metals, common components and tools, while industrial complexity is correlated with embeddedness in densely connected supply chains. To validate the network, we find structural similarities with two alternative product networks, one generated via LLM queries and the other derived by NAFTA to track product origins. We further detect linkages between products identified in manually mapped single sector supply chains, including electric vehicle batteries and semi-conductors. Finally, metrics derived from network structure capturing both forward and backward linkages are able to predict country-product diversification patterns with high accuracy.

### Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth
**Authors**: Yang Wang, Chenghao Xiao, Chia-Yi Hsiao, Zi Yan Chang, Chi-Li Chen, Tyler Loakman, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:02:50Z

**Summary**: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

### A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Tuo Feng, Wenguan Wang, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:02:23Z

**Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.

### Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence,   Characteristics, and Implications
**Authors**: Anran Li, Lingfei Qian, Mengmeng Du, Yu Yin, Yan Hu, Zihao Sun, Yihang Fu, Erica Stutz, Xuguang Ai, Qianqian Xie, Rui Zhu, Jimin Huang, Yifan Yang, Siru Liu, Yih-Chung Tham, Lucila Ohno-Machado, Hyunghoon Cho, Zhiyong Lu, Hua Xu, Qingyu Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T14:02:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

### Low-Complexity CSI Acquisition Exploiting Geographical Diversity in   Fluid Antenna System
**Authors**: Zhentian Zhang, David Morales-Jimenez, Jian Dang, Zaichen Zhang, Christos Masouros, Hao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:57:21Z

**Summary**: The fluid antenna system (FAS) employs reconfigurable antennas for high spatial gains in compact spaces, enhancing physical layer flexibility. Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is vital for port selection and FAS optimization. Greedy algorithms rely on signal assumptions, and model-free methods face high complexity. A flexible, low-complexity solution is needed for massive connectivity in FAS. Based on expectation maximization-approximate message passing (EM-AMP) framework, efficient matrix computations and adaptive learning without prior model knowledge naturally suit CSI acquisition for FAS. We propose a EM-AMP variant exploiting FAS geographical priors, improving estimation precision, accelerating convergence, and reducing complexity in large-scale deployment. Simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

### LLM Ensemble for RAG: Role of Context Length in Zero-Shot Question   Answering for BioASQ Challenge
**Authors**: Dima Galat, Diego Molla-Aliod

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:50:49Z

**Summary**: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast, complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

### No-Knowledge Alarms for Misaligned LLMs-as-Judges
**Authors**: Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:46:40Z

**Summary**: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be 100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges. The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability requirement.

### MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust   Optimization
**Authors**: Hong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:27:40Z

**Summary**: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities. Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting, with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting.

### SQLGovernor: An LLM-powered SQL Toolkit for Real World Application
**Authors**: Jie Jiang, Siqi Shen, Haining Xie, Yang Li, Yu Shen, Danqing Huang, Bo Qian, Yinjun Wu, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui, Peng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:22:58Z

**Summary**: SQL queries in real world analytical environments, whether written by humans or generated automatically often suffer from syntax errors, inefficiency, or semantic misalignment, especially in complex OLAP scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback, allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong practical utility and effective performance.

### Pay Attention to Real World Perturbations! Natural Robustness Evaluation   in Machine Reading Comprehension
**Authors**: Yulong Wu, Viktor Schlegel, Riza Batista-Navarro

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T13:22:08Z

**Summary**: As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life scenarios. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on naturally occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an arteficial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing SQUAD datasets and various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models. More worryingly, these state-of-the-art Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit these errors. Further experiments demonstrate that our findings generalise to natural perturbations found in other more challenging MRC benchmarks. In an effort to mitigate these errors, we show that it is possible to improve the robustness to natural perturbations by training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples, though a noticeable gap still remains compared to performance on unperturbed data.

### BitROM: Weight Reload-Free CiROM Architecture Towards Billion-Parameter   1.58-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wenlun Zhang, Xinyu Li, Shimpei Ando, Kentaro Yoshioka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:46:29Z

**Summary**: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.

### CM-Align: Consistency-based Multilingual Alignment for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Xue Zhang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Songming Zhang, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:40:49Z

**Summary**: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.

### MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in   Large Video Models
**Authors**: Garry Yang, Zizhe Chen, Man Hon Wong, Haoyu Lei, Yongqiang Chen, Zhenguo Li, Kaiwen Zhou, James Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T11:14:00Z

**Summary**: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.

### How Should We Meta-Learn Reinforcement Learning Algorithms?
**Authors**: Alexander David Goldie, Zilin Wang, Jaron Cohen, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster, Shimon Whiteson

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:25:27Z

**Summary**: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL. However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm. Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as performant as possible.

### Agents of Discovery
**Authors**: Sascha Diefenbacher, Anna Hallin, Gregor Kasieczka, Michael Krämer, Anne Lauscher, Tim Lukas

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:25:13Z

**Summary**: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.

### Data Skeleton Learning: Scalable Active Clustering with Sparse Graph   Structures
**Authors**: Wen-Bo Xie, Xun Fu, Bin Chen, Yan-Li Lee, Tao Deng, Tian Zou, Xin Wang, Zhen Liu, Jaideep Srivastavad

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:18:52Z

**Summary**: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3) to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

### Towards Reliable Generative AI-Driven Scaffolding: Reducing   Hallucinations and Enhancing Quality in Self-Regulated Learning Support
**Authors**: Keyang Qian, Shiqi Liu, Tongguang Li, Mladen Raković, Xinyu Li, Rui Guan, Inge Molenaar, Sadia Nawaz, Zachari Swiecki, Lixiang Yan, Dragan Gašević

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:09:14Z

**Summary**: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds a potential to advance existing educational technologies with capabilities to automatically generate personalised scaffolds that support students' self-regulated learning (SRL). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.

### MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and   LLM Spatial Reasoning
**Authors**: Chenghao Liu, Zhimu Zhou, Jiachen Zhang, Minghao Zhang, Songfang Huang, Huiling Duan

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:47:41Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).

### Hybrid Swin Attention Networks for Simultaneously Low-Dose PET and CT   Denoising
**Authors**: Yichao Liu, Hengzhi Xue, YueYang Teng

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:32:27Z

**Summary**: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety. In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet), which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features, while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise. We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

### HumanAgencyBench: Scalable Evaluation of Human Agency Support in AI   Assistants
**Authors**: Benjamin Sturgeon, Daniel Samuelson, Jacob Haimes, Jacy Reese Anthis

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:10:10Z

**Summary**: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI), we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

### Send to which account? Evaluation of an LLM-based Scambaiting System
**Authors**: Hossein Siadati, Haadi Jafarian, Sima Jafarikhah

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:08:52Z

**Summary**: Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on, including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR) of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of automated scambaiting systems.

### HiPhO: How Far Are (M)LLMs from Humans in the Latest High School Physics   Olympiad Benchmark?
**Authors**: Fangchen Yu, Haiyuan Wan, Qianjia Cheng, Yuchen Zhang, Jiacheng Chen, Fujun Han, Yulun Wu, Junchi Yao, Ruilizhen Hu, Ning Ding, Yu Cheng, Tao Chen, Lei Bai, Dongzhan Zhou, Yun Luo, Ganqu Cui, Peng Ye

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T11:05:31Z

**Summary**: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

### Design and Development of a Scalable and Energy-Efficient Localization   Framework Leveraging LoRa Ranging-Capable Transceivers
**Authors**: Hasan Albinsaid, Bodhibrata Mukhopadhyay, Mohamed-Slim Alouini

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:56:28Z

**Summary**: Precise and energy-efficient localization is a critical requirement in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly in large-scale deployments such as asset tagging, agriculture, and smart cities, where long battery life and cost-effectiveness are crucial. The Semtech SX1280 LoRa transceiver presents a promising solution for IoT localization. It combines low cost, low power, and precise ranging capability over distances of up to 1 km. However, the ranging process requires two devices to be simultaneously active, one initiating the ranging request and the other responding to it, which can lead to significant energy expenditure if not properly managed. Despite the transceiver's excellent performance, no existing system-level framework effectively manages sleep-wake coordination and role assignment needed for energy-efficient operation. This paper presents a coordination framework that significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining the inherent precise ranging capability of the chip. The framework schedules short, synchronized wake-up windows between the initiator and the responder, allowing devices to remain in deep sleep for most of their duty cycle. This scheduling strategy minimizes reliance on precise continuous timing and mitigates drift in low-cost oscillators. To validate the framework, we designed and developed custom nodes that are compliant with the framework's protocol. Experimental results show that the proposed approach allows a node to stay in ultra-low power mode and wake periodically to check for instructions. The node can remain in standby mode for up to nine months on a single coin cell battery and can perform ranging operations on demand in near real-time, all while maintaining a localization accuracy within five meters.

### Too Helpful, Too Harmless, Too Honest or Just Right?
**Authors**: Gautam Siddharth Kashyap, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:51:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

### Simulating Identity, Propagating Bias: Abstraction and Stereotypes in   LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Pia Sommerauer, Giulia Rambelli, Tommaso Caselli

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:49:21Z

**Summary**: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

### Acquiescence Bias in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Daniel Braun

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:39:24Z

**Summary**: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or disagreement.

### Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Inversion Learning for Highly Effective NLG   Evaluation Prompts
**Authors**: Hanhua Hong, Chenghao Xiao, Yang Wang, Yiqi Liu, Wenge Rong, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:32:57Z

**Summary**: Evaluating natural language generation systems is challenging due to the diversity of valid outputs. While human evaluation is the gold standard, it suffers from inconsistencies, lack of standardisation, and demographic biases, limiting reproducibility. LLM-based evaluators offer a scalable alternative but are highly sensitive to prompt design, where small variations can lead to significant discrepancies. In this work, we propose an inversion learning method that learns effective reverse mappings from model outputs back to their input instructions, enabling the automatic generation of highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts. Our method requires only a single evaluation sample and eliminates the need for time-consuming manual prompt engineering, thereby improving both efficiency and robustness. Our work contributes toward a new direction for more robust and efficient LLM-based evaluation.

### IssueBench: Millions of Realistic Prompts for Measuring Issue Bias in   LLM Writing Assistance
**Authors**: Paul Röttger, Musashi Hinck, Valentin Hofmann, Kobi Hackenburg, Valentina Pyatkin, Faeze Brahman, Dirk Hovy

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:08:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are helping millions of users write texts about diverse issues, and in doing so expose users to different ideas and perspectives. This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic English-language prompts to measure issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are very similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.

### Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in   High-Energy Physics
**Authors**: Dikshant Sagar, Kaiwen Yu, Alejandro Yankelevich, Jianming Bian, Pierre Baldi

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T13:03:04Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

### Dual-Stage Safe Herding Framework for Adversarial Attacker in Dynamic   Environment
**Authors**: Wenqing Wang, Ye Zhang, Haoyu Li, Jingyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:05:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in robotics have enabled the widespread deployment of autonomous robotic systems in complex operational environments, presenting both unprecedented opportunities and significant security problems. Traditional shepherding approaches based on fixed formations are often ineffective or risky in urban and obstacle-rich scenarios, especially when facing adversarial agents with unknown and adaptive behaviors. This paper addresses this challenge as an extended herding problem, where defensive robotic systems must safely guide adversarial agents with unknown strategies away from protected areas and into predetermined safe regions, while maintaining collision-free navigation in dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical hybrid framework based on reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning, incorporating a virtual containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to enable scalable and robust multi-agent coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to designated regions.

### Printegrated Circuits: Personal Fabrication of 3D Printed Devices with   Embedded PCBs
**Authors**: Oliver Child, Ollie Hanton, Jack Dawson, Steve Hodges, Mike Fraser

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T10:01:35Z

**Summary**: Consumer-level multi-material 3D printing with conductive thermoplastics enables fabrication of interactive elements for bespoke tangible devices. However, large feature sizes, high resistance materials, and limitations of printable control circuitry mean that deployable devices cannot be printed without post-print assembly steps. To address these challenges, we present Printegrated Circuits, a technique that uses traditional electronics as material to 3D print self-contained interactive objects. Embedded PCBs are placed into recesses during a pause in the print, and through a process we term \textit{Prinjection}, conductive filament is injected into their plated-through holes. This automatically creates reliable electrical and mechanical contact, eliminating the need for manual wiring or bespoke connectors. We describe the custom machine code generation that supports our approach, and characterise its electrical and mechanical properties. With our 6 demonstrations, we highlight how the Printegrated Circuits process fits into existing design and prototyping workflows as well as informs future research agendas.

### VIPER: Visual Perception and Explainable Reasoning for Sequential   Decision-Making
**Authors**: Mohamed Salim Aissi, Clemence Grislain, Mohamed Chetouani, Olivier Sigaud, Laure Soulier, Nicolas Thome

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:57:03Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning on text and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are highly effective for visual perception, applying those models for visual instruction-based planning remains a widely open problem. In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.

**Authors**: Figarri Keisha, Prince Singh, Pallavi, Dion Fernandes, Aravindh Manivannan, Ilham Wicaksono, Faisal Ahmad, Wiem Ben Rim

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:50:51Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has transformed how we approach text generation tasks by grounding Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved knowledge. This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.

**Authors**: Haoyu Dong, Pengkun Zhang, Mingzhe Lu, Yanzhen Shen, Guolin Ke

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T09:37:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.   Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.   Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.

**Authors**: Lei Ye, Haibo Gao, Peng Xu, Zhelin Zhang, Junqi Shan, Ao Zhang, Wei Zhang, Ruyi Zhou, Zongquan Deng, Liang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:31:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/

### Fluid-Antenna-aided AAV Secure Communications in Eavesdropper Uncertain   Location
**Authors**: Yingjie Wu, Junshan Luo, Weiyu Chen, Shilian Wang, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:24:37Z

**Summary**: For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.

### LD-ViCE: Latent Diffusion Model for Video Counterfactual Explanations
**Authors**: Payal Varshney, Adriano Lucieri, Christoph Balada, Sheraz Ahmed, Andreas Dengel

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:10:18Z

**Summary**: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

### CyberRAG: An Agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool
**Authors**: Francesco Blefari, Cristian Cosentino, Francesco Aurelio Pironti, Angelo Furfaro, Fabrizio Marozzo

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:08:15Z

**Summary**: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming analysts with logs requiring rapidly evolving expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.

### Localizing Factual Inconsistencies in Attributable Text Generation
**Authors**: Arie Cattan, Paul Roit, Shiyue Zhang, David Wan, Roee Aharoni, Idan Szpektor, Mohit Bansal, Ido Dagan

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:05:33Z

**Summary**: There has been an increasing interest in detecting hallucinations in model-generated texts, both manually and automatically, at varying levels of granularity. However, most existing methods fail to precisely pinpoint the errors. In this work, we introduce QASemConsistency, a new formalism for localizing factual inconsistencies in attributable text generation, at a fine-grained level. Drawing inspiration from Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, we propose decomposing the generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions, expressed as simple question-answer (QA) pairs, and assess whether each individual QA pair is supported by a trusted reference text. As each QA pair corresponds to a single semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, QASemConsistency effectively localizes the unsupported information. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the QASemConsistency methodology for human annotation, by collecting crowdsourced annotations of granular consistency errors, while achieving a substantial inter-annotator agreement. This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various tasks of attributable text generation. We also show that QASemConsistency yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments. Finally, we implement several methods for automatically detecting localized factual inconsistencies, with both supervised entailment models and LLMs.

### Metis: Training Large Language Models with Advanced Low-Bit Quantization
**Authors**: Hengjie Cao, Mengyi Chen, Yifeng Yang, Ruijun Huang, Fang Dong, Jixian Zhou, Anrui Chen, Mingzhi Dong, Yujiang Wang, Jinlong Hou, Yuan Cheng, Fan Wu, Fan Yang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu, Li Shang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:04:12Z

**Summary**: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://github.com/sii-research/Metis.

### How Far Are We from Optimal Reasoning Efficiency?
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Gao, Shu Yan, Qixin Tan, Lu Yang, Shusheng Xu, Wei Fu, Zhiyu Mei, Kaifeng Lyu, Yi Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:03:04Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets. Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off, with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach, REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

### AutoVeriFix: Automatically Correcting Errors and Enhancing Functional   Correctness in LLM-Generated Verilog Code
**Authors**: Yan Tan, Xiangchen Meng, Zijun Jiang, Yangdi Lyu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T09:00:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating software code for high-level programming languages such as Python and C++. However, their application to hardware description languages, such as Verilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. Current approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on syntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address these challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage framework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level Python reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the second stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests that guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations. Simulation discrepancies between the reference model and the Verilog code are iteratively used to identify and correct errors, thereby improving the functional accuracy and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in improving the functional correctness of generated Verilog code.

### An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight   Optimization
**Authors**: Zhuo Xiao, Qinglong Yao, Jingjing Wang, Fugen Zhou, Bo Liu, Haitao Sun, Zhe Ji, Yuliang Jiang, Junjie Wang, Qiuwen Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:54:16Z

**Summary**: Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.

### Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and   Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models
**Authors**: Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Sicheng Liu, Ru Zhang, Zhenjun Li, Bing Zhou, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T05:42:48Z

**Summary**: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.

**Summary**: We introduce ubiquitous intelligence as a paradigm where Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve within wireless network-driven ecosystems. Unlike static model deployments, this approach enables scalable and continuous intelligence ascension through coordination between networks and LLMs. Wireless networks support system-orchestrated lifelong learning, while LLMs drive the next-generation network development that is more adaptive and responsive. This co-evolution highlights a shift toward self-improving systems, sustaining capability growth across diverse and resource-constrained environments.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:35:19Z

**Summary**: We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. We release code, data, environment, and experiments on https://the-agent-company.com.

### LLM-Guided Ansätze Design for Quantum Circuit Born Machines in   Financial Generative Modeling
**Authors**: Yaswitha Gujju, Romain Harang, Tetsuo Shibuya

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:23:58Z

**Summary**: Quantum generative modeling using quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) shows promising potential for practical quantum advantage. However, discovering ans\"atze that are both expressive and hardware-efficient remains a key challenge, particularly on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce a prompt-based framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware-aware QCBM architectures. Prompts are conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology, while iterative feedback, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, circuit depth, and validity, is used to refine the circuits. We evaluate our method on a financial modeling task involving daily changes in Japanese government bond (JGB) interest rates. Our results show that the LLM-generated ans\"atze are significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to the standard baseline when executed on real IBM quantum hardware using 12 qubits. These findings demonstrate the practical utility of LLM-driven quantum architecture search and highlight a promising path toward robust, deployable generative models for near-term quantum devices.

### Efficient Decoding Methods for Language Models on Encrypted Data
**Authors**: Matan Avitan, Moran Baruch, Nir Drucker, Itamar Zimerman, Yoav Goldberg

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:23:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference. However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax, an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax, proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

### Low-Resource Fine-Tuning for Multi-Task Structured Information   Extraction with a Billion-Parameter Instruction-Tuned Model
**Authors**: Yu Cheng Chih, Yong Hao Hou

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:19:07Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

### Co-Investigator AI: The Rise of Agentic AI for Smarter, Trustworthy AML   Compliance Narratives
**Authors**: Prathamesh Vasudeo Naik, Naresh Kumar Dintakurthi, Zhanghao Hu, Yue Wang, Robby Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:16:04Z

**Summary**: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains. This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection, external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting, align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable, reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

### A Planning Strategy for Building a Heterogeneous Smart EM Environment
**Authors**: Arianna Benoni, Marco Salucci, Baozhu Li, Andrea Massa

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:15:44Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a planning strategy for the deployment of smart electromagnetic entities (SEEs) to enhance the wireless coverage and the Quality-of-Service (QoS) in large urban areas. The integration of different technological solutions such as integrated access-and-backhaul nodes (IABs), smart repeaters (SRs), and electromagnetic skins (EMSs) is here addressed to enable an effective and efficient implementation of the concept of Smart Electromagnetic Environment (SEME). By combining the features of such heterogeneous SEEs and optimizing their number, positions, orientations, and configuration, the electromagnetic (EM) coverage in a set of Regions-of-Interest (RoIs) of outdoor scenarios is recovered and/or enhanced subject to installation costs and energy consumption requirements. Numerical validations from real-world scenarios are reported to assess the effectiveness of the proposed planning scheme as well as to show the potentialities of an heterogeneous deployment of SEMEs.

**Summary**: Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employ a 'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. We validate CoAT's effectiveness across a variety of generative and reasoning tasks. Quantitative experiments show that CoAT achieves over 10% performance improvement on open-source multi-hop reasoning datasets (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and more than 15% gain on our proprietary CRB dataset.

### Overcoming DNSSEC Islands of Security: A TLS and IP-Based Certificate   Solution
**Authors**: Aduma Rishith, Aditya Kulkarni, Tamal Das, Vivek Balachandran

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T08:02:07Z

**Summary**: The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the backbone of the Internet, primarily translating domain names to IP addresses. Over time, various enhancements have been introduced to strengthen the integrity of DNS. Among these, DNSSEC stands out as a leading cryptographic solution. It protects against attacks (such as DNS spoofing) by establishing a chain of trust throughout the DNS nameserver hierarchy. However, DNSSEC's effectiveness is compromised when there is a break in this chain, resulting in "Islands of Security", where domains can authenticate locally but not across hierarchical levels, leading to a loss of trust and validation between them. Leading approaches to addressing these issues were centralized, with a single authority maintaining some kind of bulletin board. This approach requires significantly more infrastructure and places excessive trust in the entity responsible for managing it properly. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach to addressing gaps in DNSSEC's chain of trust, commonly referred to as "Islands of Security". We leverage TLS and IP-based certificates to enable end-to-end authentication between hierarchical levels, eliminating the need for uniform DNSSEC deployment across every level of the DNS hierarchy. This approach enhances the overall integrity of DNSSEC, while reducing dependence on registrars for maintaining signature records to verify the child nameserver's authenticity. By offering a more flexible and efficient solution, our method strengthens DNS security and streamlines deployment across diverse environments.

### <think> So let's replace this phrase with insult... </think> Lessons   learned from generation of toxic texts with LLMs
**Authors**: Sergey Pletenev, Daniil Moskovskiy, Alexander Panchenko

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:48:24Z

**Summary**: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community. This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2 datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small, repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated data for building robust detoxification systems.

### An Adaptive Scoring Framework for Attention Assessment in NDD Children   via Serious Games
**Authors**: Abdul Rehman, Ilona Heldal, Cristina Costescu, Carmen David, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:42:51Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an innovative adaptive scoring framework for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) that is attributed to the integration of multiple metrics, such as spatial attention patterns, temporal engagement, and game performance data, to create a comprehensive assessment of learning that goes beyond traditional game scoring. The framework employs a progressive difficulty adaptation method, which focuses on specific stimuli for each level and adjusts weights dynamically to accommodate increasing cognitive load and learning complexity. Additionally, it includes capabilities for temporal analysis, such as detecting engagement periods, providing rewards for sustained attention, and implementing an adaptive multiplier framework based on performance levels. To avoid over-rewarding high performers while maximizing improvement potential for students who are struggling, the designed framework features an adaptive temporal impact framework that adjusts performance scales accordingly. We also established a multi-metric validation framework using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation, along with defined quality thresholds for assessing deployment readiness in educational settings. This research bridges the gap between technical eye-tracking metrics and educational insights by explicitly mapping attention patterns to learning behaviors, enabling actionable pedagogical interventions.

### Few-shot Personalization via In-Context Learning for Speech Emotion   Recognition based on Speech-Language Model
**Authors**: Mana Ihori, Taiga Yamane, Naotaka Kawata, Naoki Makishima, Tomohiro Tanaka, Satoshi Suzuki, Shota Orihashi, Ryo Masumura

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:31:23Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a personalization method for speech emotion recognition (SER) through in-context learning (ICL). Since the expression of emotions varies from person to person, speaker-specific adaptation is crucial for improving the SER performance. Conventional SER methods have been personalized using emotional utterances of a target speaker, but it is often difficult to prepare utterances corresponding to all emotion labels in advance. Our idea to overcome this difficulty is to obtain speaker characteristics by conditioning a few emotional utterances of the target speaker in ICL-based inference. ICL is a method to perform unseen tasks by conditioning a few input-output examples through inference in large language models (LLMs). We meta-train a speech-language model extended from the LLM to learn how to perform personalized SER via ICL. Experimental results using our newly collected SER dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods.

### Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split   Mechanism
**Authors**: Jiaming Yan, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:28:24Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:24:52Z

**Summary**: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Morever, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation, assisting developers in selecting the most appropriate models for practical tasks, while laying the foundation for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.

### Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Convergence using   Pre-trained Large Language Models as Tutors With Advice Reusing
**Authors**: Lukas Toral, Teddy Lazebnik

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:08:04Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN, PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack, Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance. Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

### Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive   Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors
**Authors**: Hao Fang, Jiawei Kong, Tianqu Zhuang, Yixiang Qiu, Kuofeng Gao, Bin Chen, Shu-Tao Xia, Yaowei Wang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:03:03Z

**Summary**: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.

**Authors**: Haoyang Wang, Ruishan Guo, Pengtao Ma, Ciyu Ruan, Xinyu Luo, Wenhua Ding, Tianyang Zhong, Jingao Xu, Yunhao Liu, Xinlei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:59:24Z

**Summary**: With the increasing complexity of mobile device applications, these devices are evolving toward high agility. This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments. We hope this survey serves as a reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based vision across diverse applications.

### Boosted Training of Lightweight Early Exits for Optimizing CNN Image   Classification Inference
**Authors**: Yehudit Aperstein, Alexander Apartsin

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:47:49Z

**Summary**: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets. Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy" samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples. This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions. Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment, we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10 dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45 percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation. These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

### EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Bohan Yu, Yekun Chai

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:32:49Z

**Summary**: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation.

### Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature   of LLM Gender Biases
**Authors**: Bufan Gao, Elisa Kreiss

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:08:26Z

**Summary**: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that prompts that more clearly align with (gender bias) evaluation framing elicit distinct gender output distributions compared to less evaluation-framed prompts. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM "testing mode" performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.
