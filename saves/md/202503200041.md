 ### Efficient Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Dynamic Block-Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Emily Xiao, Chin-Jou Li, Yilin Zhang, Graham Neubig, Amanda Bertsch

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:13:42Z

**Summary**: Many-shot in-context learning has recently shown promise as an alternative to finetuning, with the major advantage that the same model can be served for multiple tasks. However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale.

**Authors**: Marianne Arriola, Aaron Gokaslan, Justin T Chiu, Zhihan Yang, Zhixuan Qi, Jiaqi Han, Subham Sekhar Sahoo, Volodymyr Kuleshov

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:58:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on the project page: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/

### Suffixient Arrays: a New Efficient Suffix Array Compression Technique
**Authors**: Davide Cenzato, Lore Depuydt, Travis Gagie, Sung-Hwan Kim, Giovanni Manzini, Francisco Olivares, Nicola Prezza

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:43:33Z

**Summary**: The Suffix Array is a classic text index enabling on-line pattern matching queries via simple binary search. The main drawback of the Suffix Array is that it takes linear space in the text's length, even if the text itself is extremely compressible. Several works in the literature showed that the Suffix Array can be compressed, but they all rely on complex succinct data structures which in practice tend to exhibit poor cache locality and thus significantly slow down queries. In this paper, we propose a new simple and very efficient solution to this problem by presenting the \emph{Suffixient Array}: a tiny subset of the Suffix Array \emph{sufficient} to locate on-line one pattern occurrence (in general, all its Maximal Exact Matches) via binary search, provided that random access to the text is available. We prove that: (i) the Suffixient Array length $\chi$ is a strong repetitiveness measure, (ii) unlike most existing repetition-aware indexes such as the $r$-index, our new index is efficient in the I/O model, and (iii) Suffixient Arrays can be computed in linear time and compressed working space. We show experimentally that, when using well-established compressed random access data structures on repetitive collections, the Suffixient Array $\SuA$ is \emph{simultaneously} (i) faster and orders of magnitude smaller than the Suffix Array $\SA$ and (ii) smaller and \emph{one to two orders of magnitude faster} than the $r$-index. With an average pattern matching query time as low as 3.5 ns per character, our new index gets very close to the ultimate lower bound: the RAM throughput of our workstation (1.18 ns per character).

### Multimodal Mamba: Decoder-only Multimodal State Space Model via   Quadratic to Linear Distillation
**Authors**: Bencheng Liao, Hongyuan Tao, Qian Zhang, Tianheng Cheng, Yingyue Li, Haoran Yin, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:02:33Z

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face deployment challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity, growing Key-Value cache requirements, and reliance on separate vision encoders. We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings. Code and models are released at https://github.com/hustvl/mmMamba

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T04:49:23Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### Efficient Hardware Accelerator Based on Medium Granularity Dataflow for   SpTRSV
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Xiaofeng Yang, Shengli Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T01:58:36Z

**Summary**: Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous studies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware accelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine granularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low parallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the spatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This paper proposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like DAGs. The accelerator implements a medium granularity dataflow through hardware-software codesign and achieves both excellent spatial locality and high parallelism. Additionally, a partial sum caching mechanism is introduced to reduce the blocking frequency of processing elements (PEs), and a reordering algorithm of intra-node edges computation is developed to enhance data reuse. Experimental results on 245 benchmarks with node counts reaching up to 85,392 demonstrate that this work achieves average performance improvements of 7.0$\times$ (up to 27.8$\times$) over CPUs and 5.8$\times$ (up to 98.8$\times$) over GPUs. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique (DPU-v2), this work shows a 2.5$\times$ (up to 5.9$\times$) average performance improvement and 1.7$\times$ (up to 4.1$\times$) average energy efficiency enhancement.

### Mitigating KV Cache Competition to Enhance User Experience in LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T23:38:29Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) serving, the KV-cache (KVC) bottleneck causes high tail Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT), impairing user experience, particularly in time-sensitive applications. However, satisfying both TTFT and TBT service-level objectives (SLOs) is challenging. To address this, we propose a system, named CacheOPT for mitigating KV Cache competition, based on key insights from our measurements, incorporating novel components. First, it estimates a request's output length, bounding the deviation with a high specified probability, adjusted based on the request arrival rate. Second, it allocates the estimated KVC demand to a request, and reuses other requests' allocated KVC to avoid preemptions while reducing waiting time. Third, it proactively allocates KVC before instead of at the time a request exhausts its allocation and reserves KVC globally to prevent preemptions. Fourth, it chooses a request that has long TBT SLO, long job remaining time and short preemption time to preempt. Fifth, it selects the shortest-latency strategy between swapping and recomputation for preemptions. Experiments show that CacheOPT achieves up to 3.29$\times$ and 2.83$\times$ lower tail TBT and tail TTFT, 47\% and 53\% higher TTFT and TBT SLO attainments, and supports up to 1.58$\times$ higher request arrival rate than the state-of-the-art methods.

### AccelGen: Heterogeneous SLO-Guaranteed High-Throughput LLM Inference   Serving for Diverse Applications
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T21:47:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we consider a mixed-prompt scenario for a large language model (LLM) inference serving system that supports diverse applications with both short prompts and long prompts and heterogeneous SLOs for iteration time. To improve throughput when handling long prompts, previous research introduces a chunking method, but has not addressed heterogeneous SLOs. To address the limitation, we propose AccelGen, a high-throughput LLM inference serving system with heterogeneous SLO guarantees for diverse applications. AccelGen introduces four core components: (1) SLO-guaranteed dynamic chunking, which dynamically adjusts chunk sizes to maximize GPU compute utilization while meeting iteration-level SLOs; (2) Iteration-level SLO-based task prioritization, which prioritizes tight-SLO requests and batches requests with similar SLOs; (3) Multi-resource-aware batching, which selects queued requests to maximize the utilizations of both GPU compute resource and key-value cache (KVC). Trace-driven real experiments demonstrate that AccelGen achieves 1.42-11.21X higher throughput, 1.43-13.71X higher goodput, 37-90% higher SLO attainment, and 1.61-12.22X lower response latency compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. It achieves performance near the Oracle, which optimally maximizes goodput.

### Fast Maximum Likelihood Positioning for a Staggered Layer Scintillation   PET Detector
**Authors**: Christoph W. Lerche, Wenwei Bi, Mirjam Schoeneck, Debora Niekaemper, Qi Liu, Elisabeth Pfaehler, Lutz Tellmann, Juergen J. Scheins, N. Jon Shah

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T21:11:30Z

**Summary**: In this study, we propose a fast implementation of a Maximum Likelihood Positioning (MLP) algorithm to estimate the energy and identify the active scintillator pixel in staggered layer scintillation detectors for PET. The staggered layer design with pixelated scintillators enables the determination of the gamma's depth of interaction and facilitates an iteration-free formulation of the MLP algorithm. The efficacy of the algorithm optimization was tested on a scintillation detector block designed for an ultra-high field BrainPET 7T, comprising three scintillator pixel layers. The three layers contain 24 x 24, 24 x 23 and 23 x 22 scintillator pixels, respectively, with a pixel pitch of 2 mm in both directions and layer thicknesses of 9, 8 and 7 mm. Calibration measurements, in combination with an automated calibration script, were used to obtain the expected counts of scintillation photons required in the MLP algorithm. Using Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization, multi-threading and optimized cache lines, a maximum processing speed of approximately 22.5 million singles per second was achieved on a platform with four Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs and 60 threads, encompassing all required processing steps. The automatic calibration failed for 1 to 15 individual scintillator pixels in approximately 10 per cent of the 120 scintillation detector blocks, necessitating manual correction. After applying the energy correction to the positioned single events, an energy resolution of of 12 +/- 2 per cent FWHM was obtained for the entire scintillation block. This value is very close to the energy resolutions measured for the individual scintillator pixels, proving that the MLP accurately identifies the scintillating pixel and that the energy correction method effectively compensates for the light collection variations of the SiPM array.

**Authors**: Hui Wang, Zhengpeng Zhao, Jing Wang, Yushu Du, Yuan Cheng, Bing Guo, He Xiao, Chenhao Ma, Xiaomeng Han, Dean You, Jiapeng Guan, Ran Wei, Dawei Yang, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T20:31:46Z

**Summary**: Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount.

**Authors**: Risheng Xu, Philipp Sieweck, Hermann von Hasseln, Dirk Nowotka

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T19:32:26Z

**Summary**: We introduce preti, a novel framework for predicting software execution time during the early stages of development. preti leverages an LLVM-based simulation environment to extract timing-related runtime information, such as the count of executed LLVM IR instructions. This information, combined with historical execution time data, is utilized to train machine learning models for accurate time prediction. To further enhance prediction accuracy, our approach incorporates simulations of cache accesses and branch prediction. The evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that preti achieves an average Absolute Percentage Error (APE) of 11.98\%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of preti as a robust solution for early-stage timing analysis.

### Knowledge-Aware Iterative Retrieval for Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Seyoung Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T15:27:02Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.

### HERMES: High-Performance RISC-V Memory Hierarchy for ML Workloads
**Authors**: Pranav Suryadevara

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T11:10:49Z

**Summary**: The growth of machine learning (ML) workloads has underscored the importance of efficient memory hierarchies to address bandwidth, latency, and scalability challenges. HERMES focuses on optimizing memory subsystems for RISC-V architectures to meet the computational needs of ML models such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. This project explores state-of-the-art techniques such as advanced prefetching, tensor-aware caching, and hybrid memory models. The cornerstone of HERMES is the integration of shared L3 caches with fine-grained coherence protocols and specialized pathways to deep learning accelerators like Gemmini. Simulation tools like Gem5 and DRAMSim2 are used to evaluate baseline performance and scalability under representative ML workloads. The findings of this study highlight the design choices and anticipated challenges, paving the way for low-latency scalable memory operations for ML applications.

**Authors**: Sam Albin, Garhan Attebury, Kenneth Bloom, Brian Paul Bockelman, Benjamin Tovar Lopez, Carl Lundstedt, Oksana Shadura, John Thiltges, Derek Weitzel, Andrew Wightman

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T09:46:35Z

**Summary**: As a part of the IRIS-HEP "Analysis Grand Challenge" activities, the Coffea-casa AF team executed a "200 Gbps Challenge". One of the goals of this challenge was to provide a setup for execution of a test notebook-style analysis on the facility that could process a 200 TB CMS NanoAOD dataset in 20 minutes.   We describe the solutions we deployed at the facility to execute the challenge tasks. The facility was configured to provide 2000+ cores for quick turn-around, low-latency analysis. To reach the highest event processing rates we tested different scaling backends, both scaling over HTCondor and Kubernetes resources and using Dask and Taskvine schedulers. This configuration also allowed us to compare two different services for managing Dask clusters, Dask labextention, and Dask Gateway server, under extreme conditions.   A robust set of XCache servers with a redirector were deployed in Kubernetes to cache the dataset to minimize wide-area network traffic. The XCache servers were backed with solid-state NVME drives deployed within the Kubernetes cluster nodes. All data access was authenticated using scitokens and was transparent to the user. To ensure we could track and measure data throughput precisely, we used our existing Prometheus monitoring stack to monitor the XCache pod throughput on the Kubernetes network layer. Using the rate query across all of the 8 XCache pods we were able to view a stacked cumulative graph of the total throughput for each XCache. This monitoring setup allowed us to ensure uniform data rates across all nodes while verifying we had reached the 200 Gbps benchmark.

### ROMA: a Read-Only-Memory-based Accelerator for QLoRA-based On-Device LLM
**Authors**: Wenqiang Wang, Yijia Zhang, Zikai Zhang, Guanting Huo, Hao Liang, Shijie Cao, Ningyi Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T09:44:17Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, deploying them on edge devices has become increasingly crucial, offering advantages in privacy and real-time interaction. QLoRA has emerged as the standard approach for on-device LLMs, leveraging quantized models to reduce memory and computational costs while utilizing LoRA for task-specific adaptability. In this work, we propose ROMA, a QLoRA accelerator with a hybrid storage architecture that uses ROM for quantized base models and SRAM for LoRA weights and KV cache. Our insight is that the quantized base model is stable and converged, making it well-suited for ROM storage. Meanwhile, LoRA modules offer the flexibility to adapt to new data without requiring updates to the base model. To further reduce the area cost of ROM, we introduce a novel B-ROM design and integrate it with the compute unit to form a fused cell for efficient use of chip resources. ROMA can effectively store both a 4-bit 3B and a 2-bit 8B LLaMA model entirely on-chip, achieving a notable generation speed exceeding 20,000 tokens/s without requiring external memory.

### WildSeg3D: Segment Any 3D Objects in the Wild from 2D Images
**Authors**: Yansong Guo, Jie Hu, Yansong Qu, Liujuan Cao

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T03:30:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in interactive 3D segmentation from 2D images have demonstrated impressive performance. However, current models typically require extensive scene-specific training to accurately reconstruct and segment objects, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the segmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a feed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in the accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can lead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global multi-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images, using a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive segmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that utilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond rapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across arbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training. Specifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA models. Our code will be publicly available.

### ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2025-03-16T16:25:31Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%. Our code is available at https://github.com/SCZwangxiao/video-ReTaKe.

### CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-16T12:49:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/cakekv.

### LazyMAR: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Feature Caching
**Authors**: Feihong Yan, Qingyan Wei, Jiayi Tang, Jiajun Li, Yulin Wang, Xuming Hu, Huiqi Li, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-16T10:54:59Z

**Summary**: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models have emerged as a promising approach in image generation, expected to surpass traditional autoregressive models in computational efficiency by leveraging the capability of parallel decoding. However, their dependence on bidirectional self-attention inherently conflicts with conventional KV caching mechanisms, creating unexpected computational bottlenecks that undermine their expected efficiency. To address this problem, this paper studies the caching mechanism for MAR by leveraging two types of redundancy: Token Redundancy indicates that a large portion of tokens have very similar representations in the adjacent decoding steps, which allows us to first cache them in previous steps and then reuse them in the later steps. Condition Redundancy indicates that the difference between conditional and unconditional output in classifier-free guidance exhibits very similar values in adjacent steps. Based on these two redundancies, we propose LazyMAR, which introduces two caching mechanisms to handle them one by one. LazyMAR is training-free and plug-and-play for all MAR models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 2.83 times acceleration with almost no drop in generation quality. Our codes will be released in https://github.com/feihongyan1/LazyMAR.

**Authors**: Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Ming Cheng, Yongcai Wang, Deying Li, Chenhui Gou, Jianfei Cai

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data-often inaccessible during online inference-and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop Point-Cache, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness.

### MoDM: Efficient Serving for Image Generation via Mixture-of-Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Yuchen Xia, Divyam Sharma, Yichao Yuan, Souvik Kundu, Nishil Talati

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T02:48:27Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trade latency for quality: small models are fast but generate lower-quality images, while large models produce better images but are slow.   We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families.   This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.   We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.

### CCRSat: A Collaborative Computation Reuse Framework for Satellite Edge   Computing Networks
**Authors**: Ye Zhang, Zhishu Shen, Dawen Jiang, Xiangrui Liu, Qiushi Zheng, Jiong Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T01:35:53Z

**Summary**: In satellite computing applications, such as remote sensing, tasks often involve similar or identical input data, leading to the same processing results. Computation reuse is an emerging paradigm that leverages the execution results of previous tasks to enhance the utilization of computational resources. While this paradigm has been extensively studied in terrestrial networks with abundant computing and caching resources, such as named data networking (NDN), it is essential to develop a framework appropriate for resource-constrained satellite networks, which are expected to have longer task completion times. In this paper, we propose CCRSat, a collaborative computation reuse framework for satellite edge computing networks. CCRSat initially implements local computation reuse on an independent satellite, utilizing a satellite reuse state (SRS) to assess the efficiency of computation reuse. Additionally, an inter-satellite computation reuse algorithm is introduced, which utilizes the collaborative sharing of similarity in previously processed data among multiple satellites. The evaluation results tested on real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared to comparative scenarios, our proposed CCRSat can significantly reduce task completion time by up to 62.1% and computational resource consumption by up to 28.8%.

**Authors**: Jan Laukemann, Ahmed E. Helal, S. Isaac Geronimo Anderson, Fabio Checconi, Yongseok Soh, Jesmin Jahan Tithi, Teresa Ranadive, Brian J Gravelle, Fabrizio Petrini, Jee Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T00:49:55Z

**Summary**: High-dimensional sparse data emerge in many critical application domains such as healthcare and cybersecurity. To extract meaningful insights from massive volumes of these multi-dimensional data, scientists employ unsupervised analysis tools based on tensor decomposition (TD) methods. However, real-world sparse tensors exhibit highly irregular shapes and data distributions, which pose significant challenges for making efficient use of modern parallel processors. This study breaks the prevailing assumption that compressing sparse tensors into coarse-grained structures or along a particular dimension/mode is more efficient than keeping them in a fine-grained, mode-agnostic form. Our novel sparse tensor representation, Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (ALTO), encodes tensors in a compact format that can be easily streamed from memory and is amenable to both caching and parallel execution. In contrast to existing compressed tensor formats, ALTO constructs one tensor copy that is agnostic to both the mode orientation and the irregular distribution of nonzero elements. To demonstrate the efficacy of ALTO, we propose a set of parallel TD algorithms that exploit the inherent data reuse of tensor computations to substantially reduce synchronization overhead, decrease memory footprint, and improve parallel performance. Additionally, we characterize the major execution bottlenecks of TD methods on the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors and introduce dynamic adaptation heuristics to automatically select the best algorithm based on the sparse tensor characteristics. Across a diverse set of real-world data sets, ALTO outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude speedup over the best mode-agnostic formats. Compared to the best mode-specific formats, ALTO achieves 5.1X geometric mean speedup at a fraction (25%) of their storage costs.

**Authors**: Neusha Javidnia, Bita Darvish Rouhani, Farinaz Koushanfar

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T19:02:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

### Making Every Step Effective: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models   Through Hierarchical KV Equalization
**Authors**: Shuyang Hao, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Jun Liu, Muhao Chen, Zi Huang, Yujun Cai

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T17:57:42Z

**Summary**: In the realm of large vision-language models (LVLMs), adversarial jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to identify safety vulnerabilities of these models and their associated defense mechanisms. However, we identify a critical limitation: not every adversarial optimization step leads to a positive outcome, and indiscriminately accepting optimization results at each step may reduce the overall attack success rate. To address this challenge, we introduce HKVE (Hierarchical Key-Value Equalization), an innovative jailbreaking framework that selectively accepts gradient optimization results based on the distribution of attention scores across different layers, ensuring that every optimization step positively contributes to the attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate HKVE's significant effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 75.08% on MiniGPT4, 85.84% on LLaVA and 81.00% on Qwen-VL, substantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 20.43\%, 21.01\% and 26.43\% respectively. Furthermore, making every step effective not only leads to an increase in attack success rate but also allows for a reduction in the number of iterations, thereby lowering computational costs. Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful example data.

### Alchemist: Towards the Design of Efficient Online Continual Learning   System
**Authors**: Yuyang Huang, Yuhan Liu, Haryadi S. Gunawi, Beibin Li, Changho Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T16:57:12Z

**Summary**: Continual learning has become a promising solution to refine large language models incrementally by leveraging user feedback. In particular, online continual learning - iteratively training the model with small batches of user feedback - has demonstrated notable performance improvements. However, the existing practice of separating training and serving processes forces the online trainer to recompute the intermediate results already done during serving. Such redundant computations can account for 30%-42% of total training time.   In this paper, we propose Alchemist, to the best of our knowledge, the first online continual learning system that efficiently reuses serving activations to increase training throughput. Alchemist introduces two key techniques: (1) recording and storing activations and KV cache only during the prefill phase to minimize latency and memory overhead; and (2) smart activation offloading and hedging. Evaluations with inputs of varied token length sampled from ShareGPT dataset show that compared with a separate training cluster, Alchemist significantly increases training throughput by up to 1.72x, reduces up to 47% memory usage during training, and supports up to 2x more training tokens - all while maintaining negligible impact on serving latency.

### ARCAS: Adaptive Runtime System for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling
**Authors**: Alessandro Fogli, Bo Zhao, Peter Pietzuch, Jana Giceva

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T14:47:55Z

**Summary**: The growing disparity between CPU core counts and available memory bandwidth has intensified memory contention in servers. This particularly affects highly parallelizable applications, which must achieve efficient cache utilization to maintain performance as CPU core counts grow. Optimizing cache utilization, however, is complex for recent chiplet-based CPUs, whose partitioned L3 caches lead to varying latencies and bandwidths, even within a single NUMA domain. Classical NUMA optimizations and task scheduling approaches unfortunately fail to address the performance issues of chiplet-based CPUs.   We describe Adaptive Runtime system for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling (ARCAS), a new runtime system designed for chiplet-based CPUs. ARCAS combines chiplet-aware task scheduling heuristics, hardware-aware memory allocation, and fine-grained performance monitoring to optimize workload execution. It implements a lightweight concurrency model that combines user-level thread features-such as individual stacks, per-task scheduling, and state management-with coroutine-like behavior, allowing tasks to suspend and resume execution at defined points while efficiently managing task migration across chiplets. Our evaluation across diverse scenarios shows ARCAS's effectiveness for optimizing the performance of memory-intensive parallel applications.

### Text Compression for Efficient Language Generation
**Authors**: David Gu, Peter Belcak, Roger Wattenhofer

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T14:14:05Z

**Summary**: We challenge the prevailing assumption that LLMs must rely fully on sub-word tokens for high-quality text generation. To this end, we propose the "Generative Pretrained Thoughtformer" (GPTHF), a hierarchical transformer language model capable of text generation by compressing text into sentence embeddings and employing a sentence attention mechanism. GPTHF retains GPT's architecture, modifying only token interactions via dynamic sparse attention masks.   Our experiments show that GPTHF achieves an up to an order of magnitude improvement in FLOPs efficiency and a threefold increase in runtime speed compared to equally-sized GPT models in the low-size regime. This is achieved through a unique generation method that caches and reuses sentence embeddings, allowing significant portions of the input to bypass large parts of the network.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T06:49:37Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid (i.e., combination of regular attention and MLA layers) or full MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. Our results show that using an 8B teacher model allows us to compress the KV cache size of the Llama3.2-1B-Inst baseline by 6.4x while preserving 100% of its average score across multiple tasks on the LM Harness Evaluation benchmark. This is achieved with only 3.6B training tokens and about 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300 GPUs, compared to the 370K GPU hours required for pre-training the Llama3.2-1B model.

### Limits of KV Cache Compression for Tensor Attention based Autoregressive   Transformers
**Authors**: Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T06:01:42Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache in autoregressive transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference, which restricts the context length capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanism [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a novel reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. In the low dimensional regime where $d = o(\log n)$, we analyze the theoretical bounds of the space complexity as well. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the compression-expressivity tradeoff in tensor attention mechanisms and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient transformer architectures.

### Long Context Tuning for Video Generation
**Authors**: Yuwei Guo, Ceyuan Yang, Ziyan Yang, Zhibei Ma, Zhijie Lin, Zhenheng Yang, Dahua Lin, Lu Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T17:40:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in video generation can produce realistic, minute-long single-shot videos with scalable diffusion transformers. However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation. See https://guoyww.github.io/projects/long-context-video/ for more details.

### Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding
**Authors**: Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T17:19:51Z

**Summary**: We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

### ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion   Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Yuxuan Song, Yufei Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei-Ying Ma, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T16:29:17Z

**Summary**: We present ACDiT, a novel Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, that innovatively combines autoregressive and diffusion paradigms for modeling continuous visual information. By introducing a block-wise autoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of discrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a conditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on standard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive baselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT can be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel perspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for unified models.

### TokenCarve: Information-Preserving Visual Token Compression in   Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xudong Tan, Peng Ye, Chongjun Tu, Jianjian Cao, Yaoxin Yang, Lin Zhang, Dongzhan Zhou, Tao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T16:04:31Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming increasingly popular, while the high computational cost associated with multimodal data input, particularly from visual tokens, poses a significant challenge. Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It can even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count, achieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage, and only a 1.54% drop in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShawnTan86/TokenCarve.

### Source-primed Multi-turn Conversation Helps Large Language Models   Translate Documents
**Authors**: Hanxu Hu, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T15:57:50Z

**Summary**: LLMs have paved the way for truly simple document-level machine translation, but challenges such as omission errors remain. In this paper, we study a simple method for handling document-level machine translation, by leveraging previous contexts in a multi-turn conversational manner. Specifically, by decomposing documents into segments and iteratively translating them while maintaining previous turns, this method ensures coherent translations without additional training, and can fully re-use the KV cache of previous turns thus minimizing computational overhead. We further propose a `source-primed' method that first provides the whole source document before multi-turn translation. We empirically show this multi-turn method outperforms both translating entire documents in a single turn and translating each segment independently according to multiple automatic metrics in representative LLMs, establishing a strong baseline for document-level translation using LLMs.

### KV-Distill: Nearly Lossless Learnable Context Compression for LLMs
**Authors**: Vivek Chari, Guanghui Qin, Benjamin Van Durme

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T13:15:28Z

**Summary**: Sequence-to-sequence tasks often benefit from long contexts, but the quadratic complexity of self-attention in standard Transformers renders this non-trivial. During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures.

### EEdit : Rethinking the Spatial and Temporal Redundancy for Efficient   Image Editing
**Authors**: Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T11:26:45Z

**Summary**: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

### FlashRNN: I/O-Aware Optimization of Traditional RNNs on modern hardware
**Authors**: Korbinian Pöppel, Maximilian Beck, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T11:14:49Z

**Summary**: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T05:43:14Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MEDA: Dynamic KV Cache Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Hui Shen, Xin Wang, Che Liu, Zheda Mai, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T04:04:08Z

**Summary**: Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long text-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their multimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths, challenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in both text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations across layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies for layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic layer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context inference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to determine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically allocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection scheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that merges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the entire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82 times faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on various multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and long-video scenarios. Our code is released at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/MEDA.

**Summary**: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often suffer from irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. We propose ZeroMerge, a dynamic zero-shot compression framework that achieves efficient cache management through three key innovations: (1) Fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) A residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) Parameter-free adaptation compatible with diverse LLM architectures without retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across LLaMA-2 model demonstrate that ZeroMerge maintains full-cache performance at 5\% compression ratios while doubling inference throughput at 40K token lengths. The method effectively balances memory efficiency, generation quality, and deployment flexibility, advancing practical long-context LLM applications. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZeroMerge.

### D2O: Dynamic Discriminative Operations for Efficient Long-Context   Inference of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Xinjian Wu, Yu Zhang, Yi Xin, Chaofan Tao, Zhihong Zhu, Xin Wang, Siqi Luo, Jing Xiong, Longyue Wang, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T03:16:43Z

**Summary**: Generative inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is impeded by the growing memory demands of Key-Value (KV) cache, especially for longer sequences. Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, leading to issues such as context loss or hallucinations. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Discriminative Operations (D2O), a KV cache compression method that optimizes KV cache size dynamically and discriminatively at two levels without fine-tuning, while preserving essential context. At layer level, D2O leverages the varying densities of attention weights between shallow and deep layers to dynamically determine which layers should avoid excessive eviction via a novel dynamic allocation strategy to minimize information loss. At token level, D2O incorporates a compensation mechanism that maintains a similarity threshold to re-discriminate the importance of currently discarded tokens, determining whether they should be recalled and merged with similar tokens. We conduct experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures. Our results show that D2O not only achieves significant memory savings and enhances inference throughput by more than 3$\times$ but also maintains high-quality long-text generation.

### MoE-Infinity: Efficient MoE Inference on Personal Machines with   Sparsity-Aware Expert Cache
**Authors**: Leyang Xue, Yao Fu, Zhan Lu, Luo Mai, Mahesh Marina

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T18:14:21Z

**Summary**: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an efficient MoE inference system designed for personal machines with limited GPU memory capacity. The key idea for MoE-Infinity is that on personal machines, which are often single-user environments, MoE-based LLMs typically operate with a batch size of one. In this setting, MoE models exhibit a high degree of activation sparsity, meaning a small number of experts are frequently reused in generating tokens during the decode phase. Leveraging this idea, we design a sparsity-aware expert cache, which can trace the sparse activation of experts during inference and carefully select the trace that represents the sparsity pattern. By analyzing these selected traces, MoE-Infinity guides the replacement and prefetching of the expert cache, providing 3.1-16.7x per-token latency improvements over numerous state-of-the-art systems, including vLLM, Ollama, DeepSpeed and BrainStorm across various MoE models (DeepSeek and Mixtral) when handling different LLM tasks. MoE-Infinity's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/EfficientMoE/MoE-Infinity

**Authors**: Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T17:59:18Z

**Summary**: Long-range tasks demand reasoning over long inputs. Current solutions require large compute budgets, training data, model weight access, or complex task-specific designs. We introduce PRISM, which processes information as a stream of chunks while maintaining a structured in-context memory specified with a typed hierarchical schema. PRISM outperforms baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x shorter contexts than long-context models. This approach is token-efficient, producing concise outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54% compared to alternative short-context methods. PRISM scales down to tiny chunks (<500 tokens) without increasing encoding costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to new tasks with minimal effort by automatically generating schemas from task descriptions.

### N2C2: Nearest Neighbor Enhanced Confidence Calibration for Cross-Lingual   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Jie He, Simon Yu, Deyi Xiong, Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T10:05:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements of in-context learning (ICL) show language models can significantly improve their performance when demonstrations are provided. However, little attention has been paid to model calibration and prediction confidence of ICL in cross-lingual scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conduct a thorough analysis of ICL for cross-lingual sentiment classification. Our findings suggest that ICL performs poorly in cross-lingual scenarios, exhibiting low accuracy and presenting high calibration errors. In response, we propose a novel approach, N2C2, which employs a -nearest neighbors augmented classifier for prediction confidence calibration. N2C2 narrows the prediction gap by leveraging a datastore of cached few-shot instances. Specifically, N2C2 integrates the predictions from the datastore and incorporates confidence-aware distribution, semantically consistent retrieval representation, and adaptive neighbor combination modules to effectively utilize the limited number of supporting instances. Evaluation on two multilingual sentiment classification datasets demonstrates that N2C2 outperforms traditional ICL. It surpasses fine tuning, prompt tuning and recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and calibration errors.

### KV-Edit: Training-Free Image Editing for Precise Background Preservation
**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Jiawei Shao, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T07:23:32Z

**Summary**: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

### FasterCache: Training-Free Video Diffusion Model Acceleration with High   Quality
**Authors**: Zhengyao Lv, Chenyang Si, Junhao Song, Zhenyu Yang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu, Kwan-Yee K. Wong

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T03:40:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

**Authors**: Aparna Sasidharan, Xian-He, Jay Lofstead, Scott Klasky

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T00:12:39Z

**Summary**: This work describes the design, implementation and performance analysis of a distributed two-tiered storage software. The first tier functions as a distributed software cache implemented using solid-state devices~(NVMes) and the second tier consists of multiple hard disks~(HDDs). We describe an online learning algorithm that manages data movement between the tiers. The software is hybrid, i.e. both distributed and multi-threaded. The end-to-end performance model of the two-tier system was developed using queuing networks and behavioral models of storage devices. We identified significant parameters that affect the performance of storage devices and created behavioral models for each device. The performance of the software was evaluated on a many-core cluster using non-trivial read/write workloads. The paper provides examples to illustrate the use of these models.

**Summary**: Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT/LSMO/BCZT) sandwich films were elaborated using the sol-gel spin coating process. The dielectric properties displayed excellent thermal stability with the temperature coefficient of capacitance, TCC, remaining within 10% between -50 C and 300 C. The high energy storage density, Wrec, of 11.8 J/cm3 observed in this sandwich films, is nearly twice as high as that of the BCZT films, with an efficiency, n, of 77% under a weak electric field of 800 kV/cm. Furthermore, the stability of Wrec and n was observed along the studied temperature interval making them promising candidates for high-temperature energy storage capacitors.

### LLMs Know What to Drop: Self-Attention Guided KV Cache Eviction for   Efficient Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Guangtao Wang, Shubhangi Upasani, Chen Wu, Darshan Gandhi, Jonathan Li, Changran Hu, Bo Li, Urmish Thakker

**Updated**: 2025-03-11T20:45:02Z

**Summary**: Efficient long-context inference is critical as large language models (LLMs) adopt context windows of ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. However, the growing key-value (KV) cache and the high computational complexity of attention create significant bottlenecks in memory usage and latency. In this paper, we find that attention in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs implicitly "know" which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level after the pre-filling stage. Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction~(SAGE-KV), a simple and effective KV eviction cache method for long-context inference. After prefilling, our method performs a one-time top-k selection at both the token and head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling efficient inference with the reduced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three long-context LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable to full attention while significantly improving efficiency. Specifically, SAGE-KV achieves 4x higher memory efficiency with improved accuracy over the static KV cache selection method StreamLLM, and 2x higher memory efficiency with better accuracy than the dynamic KV cache selection method Quest.

### FastCache: Optimizing Multimodal LLM Serving through Lightweight   KV-Cache Compression Framework
**Authors**: Jianian Zhu, Hang Wu, Haojie Wang, Yinghui Li, Biao Hou, Ruixuan Li, Jidong Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-03-11T14:10:58Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serving systems commonly employ KV-cache compression to reduce memory footprint. However, existing compression methods introduce significant processing overhead and queuing delays, particularly in concurrent serving scenarios. We present \texttt{FastCache}, a novel serving framework that effectively addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a dynamic batching strategy that optimizes request scheduling across prefill, compression, and decode stages, and (2) an efficient KV-cache memory pool mechanism that eliminates memory fragmentation while maintaining high GPU utilization. Our comprehensive experiments on the GQA and MileBench datasets demonstrate that \texttt{FastCache} achieves up to 19.3$\times$ reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 12.1$\times$ improvement in throughput compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The system maintains stable performance under high-concurrency scenarios (up to 40 req/s) while reducing average memory consumption by 20\%. These results establish \texttt{FastCache} as an efficient solution for real-world LLM serving systems with KV-cache compression.

### SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods
**Authors**: Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Chengruidong Zhang, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Jianfeng Gao, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-03-11T14:02:04Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

### Coherent Video Inpainting Using Optical Flow-Guided Efficient Diffusion
**Authors**: Bohai Gu, Hao Luo, Song Guo, Peiran Dong, Qihua Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-11T13:13:11Z

**Summary**: The text-guided video inpainting technique has significantly improved the performance of content generation applications. A recent family for these improvements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving high-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance bottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This motivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic flow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters provide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow. Extensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality and efficiency. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2025-03-11T09:17:02Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### Optimization and Benchmarking of Monolithically Stackable Gain Cell   Memory for Last-Level Cache
**Authors**: Faaiq Waqar, Jungyoun Kwak, Junmo Lee, Minji Shon, Mohammadhosein Gholamrezaei, Kevin Skadron, Shimeng Yu

**Updated**: 2025-03-11T03:26:20Z

**Summary**: The Last Level Cache (LLC) is the processor's critical bridge between on-chip and off-chip memory levels - optimized for high density, high bandwidth, and low operation energy. To date, high-density (HD) SRAM has been the conventional device of choice; however, with the slowing of transistor scaling, as reflected in the industry's almost identical HD SRAM cell size from 5 nm to 3 nm, alternative solutions such as 3D stacking with advanced packaging like hybrid bonding are pursued (as demonstrated in AMD's V-cache). Escalating data demands necessitate ultra-large on-chip caches to decrease costly off-chip memory movement, pushing the exploration of device technology toward monolithic 3D (M3D) integration where transistors can be stacked in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) at the interconnect level. M3D integration requires fabrication techniques compatible with a low thermal budget (<400 degC). Among promising BEOL device candidates are amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors, particularly desirable for their ultra-low leakage (<fA/um), enabling persistent data retention (>seconds) when used in a gain-cell configuration. This paper examines device, circuit, and system-level tradeoffs when optimizing BEOL-compatible AOS-based 2-transistor gain cell (2T-GC) for LLC. A cache early-exploration tool, NS-Cache, is developed to model caches in advanced 7 and 3 nm nodes and is integrated with the Gem5 simulator to systematically benchmark the impact of the newfound density/performance when compared to HD-SRAM, MRAM, and 1T1C eDRAM alternatives for LLC.

### Queueing, Predictions, and LLMs: Challenges and Open Problems
**Authors**: Michael Mitzenmacher, Rana Shahout

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T17:12:47Z

**Summary**: Queueing systems present many opportunities for applying machine-learning predictions, such as estimated service times, to improve system performance. This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely Large Language Model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value (KV) store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems, and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems.

### TokenButler: Token Importance is Predictable
**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Ahmed F AbouElhamayed, Yifei Gao, Chi-Chih Chang, Nilesh Jain, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T16:41:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the Key-Value (KV) Cache to store token history, enabling efficient decoding of tokens. As the KV-Cache grows, it becomes a major memory and computation bottleneck, however, there is an opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, especially because prior research has shown that only a small subset of tokens contribute meaningfully to each decoding step. A key challenge in finding these critical tokens is that they are dynamic, and heavily input query-dependent. Existing methods either risk quality by evicting tokens permanently, or retain the full KV-Cache but rely on retrieving chunks (pages) of tokens at generation, failing at dense, context-rich tasks. Additionally, many existing KV-Cache sparsity methods rely on inaccurate proxies for token importance. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenButler, a high-granularity, query-aware predictor that learns to identify these critical tokens. By training a light-weight predictor with less than 1.2% parameter overhead, TokenButler prioritizes tokens based on their contextual, predicted importance. This improves perplexity & downstream accuracy by over 8% relative to SoTA methods for estimating token importance. We evaluate TokenButler on a novel synthetic small-context co-referential retrieval task, demonstrating near-oracle accuracy.

### Revealing Rotational Symmetry Breaking Charge-density Wave Order in   Kagome Superconductor (Rb, K)V$_3$Sb$_5$ by Ultrafast Pump-probe Experiments
**Authors**: Qinwen Deng, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Binghai Yan, Liang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T15:49:20Z

**Summary**: The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.

### Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing Diffusion Transformer Feature   Caching
**Authors**: Zhen Zou, Hu Yu, Jie Xiao, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T09:49:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this problem, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing the impact of caching on the generation of intermediate processes. So the lack of exploration provides us with room for analysis and improvement. In this paper, we analyze the impact of caching on the SNR of the diffusion process and discern that feature caching intensifies the denoising procedure, and we further identify this as a more severe exposure bias issue. Drawing on this insight, we introduce EB-Cache, a joint cache strategy that aligns the Non-exposure bias (which gives us a higher performance ceiling) diffusion process. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive understanding of caching mechanisms and offers a novel perspective on leveraging caches to expedite diffusion processes. Empirical results indicate that EB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Specifically, in the 50-step generation process, EB-Cache achieves 1.49$\times$ acceleration with 0.63 FID reduction from 3.69, surpassing prior acceleration methods.

### EasyControl: Adding Efficient and Flexible Control for Diffusion   Transformer
**Authors**: Yuxuan Zhang, Yirui Yuan, Yiren Song, Haofan Wang, Jiaming Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T08:07:17Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Unet-based diffusion models, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, have introduced effective spatial and subject control mechanisms. However, the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture still struggles with efficient and flexible control. To tackle this issue, we propose EasyControl, a novel framework designed to unify condition-guided diffusion transformers with high efficiency and flexibility. Our framework is built on three key innovations. First, we introduce a lightweight Condition Injection LoRA Module. This module processes conditional signals in isolation, acting as a plug-and-play solution. It avoids modifying the base model weights, ensuring compatibility with customized models and enabling the flexible injection of diverse conditions. Notably, this module also supports harmonious and robust zero-shot multi-condition generalization, even when trained only on single-condition data. Second, we propose a Position-Aware Training Paradigm. This approach standardizes input conditions to fixed resolutions, allowing the generation of images with arbitrary aspect ratios and flexible resolutions. At the same time, it optimizes computational efficiency, making the framework more practical for real-world applications. Third, we develop a Causal Attention Mechanism combined with the KV Cache technique, adapted for conditional generation tasks. This innovation significantly reduces the latency of image synthesis, improving the overall efficiency of the framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EasyControl achieves exceptional performance across various application scenarios. These innovations collectively make our framework highly efficient, flexible, and suitable for a wide range of tasks.

### From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   TaylorSeers
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Junjie Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T05:09:42Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

### Piccolo: Large-Scale Graph Processing with Fine-Grained In-Memory   Scatter-Gather
**Authors**: Changmin Shin, Jaeyong Song, Hongsun Jang, Dogeun Kim, Jun Sung, Taehee Kwon, Jae Hyung Ju, Frank Liu, Yeonkyu Choi, Jinho Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-10T02:41:21Z

**Summary**: Graph processing requires irregular, fine-grained random access patterns incompatible with contemporary off-chip memory architecture, leading to inefficient data access. This inefficiency makes graph processing an extremely memory-bound application. Because of this, existing graph processing accelerators typically employ a graph tiling-based or processing-in-memory (PIM) approach to relieve the memory bottleneck. In the tiling-based approach, a graph is split into chunks that fit within the on-chip cache to maximize data reuse. In the PIM approach, arithmetic units are placed within memory to perform operations such as reduction or atomic addition. However, both approaches have several limitations, especially when implemented on current memory standards (i.e., DDR). Because the access granularity provided by DDR is much larger than that of the graph vertex property data, much of the bandwidth and cache capacity are wasted. PIM is meant to alleviate such issues, but it is difficult to use in conjunction with the tiling-based approach, resulting in a significant disadvantage. Furthermore, placing arithmetic units inside a memory chip is expensive, thereby supporting multiple types of operation is thought to be impractical. To address the above limitations, we present Piccolo, an end-to-end efficient graph processing accelerator with fine-grained in-memory random scatter-gather. Instead of placing expensive arithmetic units in off-chip memory, Piccolo focuses on reducing the off-chip traffic with non-arithmetic function-in-memory of random scatter-gather. To fully benefit from in-memory scatter-gather, Piccolo redesigns the cache and MHA of the accelerator such that it can enjoy both the advantage of tiling and in-memory operations. Piccolo achieves a maximum speedup of 3.28$\times$ and a geometric mean speedup of 1.62$\times$ across various and extensive benchmarks.

### Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Xianglong Liu, Jing Liu, Yuhang Li, Jiwen Lu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-03-09T17:43:28Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.

### AsymRnR: Video Diffusion Transformers Acceleration with Asymmetric   Reduction and Restoration
**Authors**: Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Zhao Jin, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-03-09T16:14:51Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have proven effective in generating high-quality videos but are hindered by high computational costs. Existing video DiT sampling acceleration methods often rely on costly fine-tuning or exhibit limited generalization capabilities. We propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free and model-agnostic method to accelerate video DiTs. It builds on the observation that redundancies of feature tokens in DiTs vary significantly across different model blocks, denoising steps, and feature types. Our AsymRnR asymmetrically reduces redundant tokens in the attention operation, achieving acceleration with negligible degradation in output quality and, in some cases, even improving it. We also tailored a reduction schedule to distribute the reduction across components adaptively. To further accelerate this process, we introduce a matching cache for more efficient reduction. Backed by theoretical foundations and extensive experimental validation, AsymRnR integrates into state-of-the-art video DiTs and offers substantial speedup.

**Authors**: Yingfeng Luo, Tong Zheng, Yongyu Mu, Bei Li, Qinghong Zhang, Yongqi Gao, Ziqiang Xu, Peinan Feng, Xiaoqian Liu, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-03-09T12:54:05Z

**Summary**: The field of neural machine translation (NMT) has changed with the advent of large language models (LLMs). Much of the recent emphasis in natural language processing (NLP) has been on modeling machine translation and many other problems using a single pre-trained Transformer decoder, while encoder-decoder architectures, which were the standard in earlier NMT models, have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we explore translation models that are universal, efficient, and easy to optimize, by marrying the world of LLMs with the world of NMT. We apply LLMs to NMT encoding and leave the NMT decoder unchanged. We also develop methods for adapting LLMs to work better with the NMT decoder. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset involving multiple tasks to assess how well the machine translation system generalizes across various tasks. Evaluations on the WMT and our datasets show that results using our method match or surpass a range of baselines in terms of translation quality, but achieve $2.4 \sim 6.5 \times$ inference speedups and a $75\%$ reduction in the memory footprint of the KV cache. It also demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of translation-related tasks.

### QuantCache: Adaptive Importance-Guided Quantization with Hierarchical   Latent and Layer Caching for Video Generation
**Authors**: Junyi Wu, Zhiteng Li, Zheng Hui, Yulun Zhang, Linghe Kong, Xiaokang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-09T10:31:51Z

**Summary**: Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a dominant architecture in video generation, surpassing U-Net-based models in terms of performance. However, the enhanced capabilities of DiTs come with significant drawbacks, including increased computational and memory costs, which hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Current acceleration techniques, such as quantization and cache mechanism, offer limited speedup and are often applied in isolation, failing to fully address the complexities of DiT architectures. In this paper, we propose QuantCache, a novel training-free inference acceleration framework that jointly optimizes hierarchical latent caching, adaptive importance-guided quantization, and structural redundancy-aware pruning. QuantCache achieves an end-to-end latency speedup of 6.72$\times$ on Open-Sora with minimal loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, setting a new standard for efficient DiT inference. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/JunyiWuCode/QuantCache.

### Seesaw: High-throughput LLM Inference via Model Re-sharding
**Authors**: Qidong Su, Wei Zhao, Xin Li, Muralidhar Andoorveedu, Chenhao Jiang, Zhanda Zhu, Kevin Song, Christina Giannoula, Gennady Pekhimenko

**Updated**: 2025-03-09T04:14:06Z

**Summary**: To improve the efficiency of distributed large language model (LLM) inference, various parallelization strategies, such as tensor and pipeline parallelism, have been proposed. However, the distinct computational characteristics inherent in the two stages of LLM inference-prefilling and decoding-render a single static parallelization strategy insufficient for the effective optimization of both stages. In this work, we present Seesaw, an LLM inference engine optimized for throughput-oriented tasks. The key idea behind Seesaw is dynamic model re-sharding, a technique that facilitates the dynamic reconfiguration of parallelization strategies across stages, thereby maximizing throughput at both phases. To mitigate re-sharding overhead and optimize computational efficiency, we employ tiered KV cache buffering and transition-minimizing scheduling. These approaches work synergistically to reduce the overhead caused by frequent stage transitions while ensuring maximum batching efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Seesaw achieves a throughput increase of up to 1.78x (1.36x on average) compared to vLLM, the most widely used state-of-the-art LLM inference engine.

### Learning Mamba as a Continual Learner: Meta-learning Selective State   Space Models for Efficient Continual Learning
**Authors**: Chongyang Zhao, Dong Gong

**Updated**: 2025-03-09T02:19:22Z

**Summary**: Continual learning (CL) aims to efficiently learn from a non-stationary data stream, without storing or recomputing all seen samples. CL enables prediction on new tasks by incorporating sequential training samples. Building on this connection between CL and sequential modeling, meta-continual learning (MCL) aims to meta-learn an efficient continual learner as a sequence prediction model, with advanced sequence models like Transformers being natural choices. However, despite decent performance, Transformers rely on a linearly growing cache to store all past representations, conflicting with CL's objective of not storing all seen samples and limiting efficiency. In this paper, we focus on meta-learning sequence-prediction-based continual learners without retaining all past representations. While attention-free models with fixed-size hidden states (e.g., Linear Transformers) align with CL's essential goal and efficiency needs, they have shown limited effectiveness in MCL in previous literature. Given Mamba's strong sequence modeling performance and attention-free nature, we explore a key question: Can attention-free models like Mamba perform well on MCL? By formulating Mamba and the SSM for MCL tasks, we propose MambaCL, a meta-learned continual learner. To enhance MambaCL's training, we introduce selectivity regularization, leveraging the connection between Mamba and Transformers to guide its behavior over sequences. Furthermore, we study how Mamba and other models perform across various MCL scenarios through extensive and well-designed experiments. Our results highlight the promising performance and strong generalization of Mamba and attention-free models in MCL, demonstrating its potential for efficient continual learning and adaptation.

### Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with   Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti

**Updated**: 2025-03-08T21:55:15Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.

**Authors**: Zifan Zhang, Minghong Fang, Dianwei Chen, Xianfeng Yang, Yuchen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-08T18:30:54Z

**Summary**: Digital network twins (DNTs) are virtual representations of physical networks, designed to enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of network performance. When integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL), DNTs emerge as powerful solutions for managing the complexities of network operations. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergy of DNTs, FL, and RL techniques, showcasing their collective potential to address critical challenges in 6G networks. We highlight key technical challenges that need to be addressed, such as ensuring network reliability, achieving joint data-scenario forecasting, and maintaining security in high-risk environments. Additionally, we propose several pipelines that integrate DNT and ML within coherent frameworks to enhance network optimization and security. Case studies demonstrate the practical applications of our proposed pipelines in edge caching and vehicular networks. In edge caching, the pipeline achieves over 80% cache hit rates while balancing base station loads. In autonomous vehicular system, it ensure a 100% no-collision rate, showcasing its reliability in safety-critical scenarios. By exploring these synergies, we offer insights into the future of intelligent and adaptive network systems that automate decision-making and problem-solving.

### Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach
**Authors**: Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Yang Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Yehui Tang, Xudong Lu, Zhihang Liu, Yun Zheng, Yu Liu, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-08T14:48:15Z

**Summary**: Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights will be released shortly, so please stay tuned for updates!

### ML-based Adaptive Prefetching and Data Placement for US HEP Systems
**Authors**: Venkat Sai Suman Lamba Karanam, Sarat Sasank Barla, Byrav Ramamurthy, Derek Weitzel

**Updated**: 2025-03-08T02:35:16Z

**Summary**: Although benefits from caching in US HEP are well-known, current caching strategies are not adaptive i.e. they do not adapt to changing cache access patterns. Newer developments such as High Luminosity - Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a steady move toward streaming readout based Data Acquisition systems (DAQs) will increase the data production exponentially and hence burden the storage, compute \& network infrastructures. Moreover, existing caching frameworks are optimized to reduce latency, but not optimized for storage. This in combination with limited cache capacities relative to total data makes it difficult to achieve data locality.   In this work, we present Machine Learning-aided (ML) caching strategies. Specifically, first we present a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) hourly cache usage prediction. Second, we present an hourly file-level access prediction model based on CatboostRegressor. To date, most ML-based cache prediction strategies in HEP have focused on daily cache usage and limited works tackled hourly cache usage and even less strategies addressed hourly file-level access prediction. File-level access prediction allows for the design of intelligent prefetching and data placement strategies with fine-grained control. We validated our cache prediction strategies using data collected from SoCal MINI caches in August 2024. We are currently extending WRENCH simulator to reflect the US HEP ecosystem at the storage, network and compute levels. We plan to deploy our cache prediction strategies into WRENCH and later perform extensive analysis with complex data access patterns and candidate infrastructure configurations.

### Choosing Augmentation Parameters in OSQP- A New Approach based on   Conjugate Directions
**Authors**: Avinash Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T21:16:41Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a new method to select the augmentation parameters in the operator splitting quadratic program (OSQP) algorithm so as to reduce the computation time of overall algorithm. The selection is based upon the information of conjugate directions of the coefficient matrix of a linear system of equations present in the algorithm. This selection makes it possible to cache these conjugate directions, instead of computing them at each iteration, resulting in faster computation of the solution of the linear system thus reducing the overall computation time. This reduction is demonstrated by a numerical example.

### Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput   tradeoff
**Authors**: Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher Ré

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:57:52Z

**Summary**: Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. Code for this work is provided at: https://github.com/HazyResearch/based.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:47:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DeFT.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:54:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. We evaluate Proximity on the MMLU and MedRAG benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining response accuracy. Proximity reduces retrieval latency by up to 59% while maintaining accuracy and lowers the computational burden on the vector database. We also experiment with different similarity thresholds and quantify the trade-off between speed and recall. Our work shows that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Caching for LLM Web Services
**Authors**: Waris Gill, Mohamed Elidrisi, Pallavi Kalapatapu, Ammar Ahmed, Ali Anwar, Muhammad Ali Gulzar

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:49:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Gradient-Optimized Cache
**Authors**: Junxiang Qiu, Lin Liu, Shuo Wang, Jinda Lu, Kezhou Chen, Yanbin Hao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T05:31:47Z

**Summary**: Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements.

### LVLM-Compress-Bench: Benchmarking the Broader Impact of Large   Vision-Language Model Compression
**Authors**: Souvik Kundu, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Sungduk Yu, Phillip Howard, Tiep Le, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, David Cobbley, Hao Kang, Vasudev Lal

**Updated**: 2025-03-06T21:21:18Z

**Summary**: Despite recent efforts in understanding the compression impact on large language models (LLMs) in terms of their downstream task performance and trustworthiness on relatively simpler uni-modal benchmarks (for example, question answering, common sense reasoning), their detailed study on multi-modal Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is yet to be unveiled. Towards mitigating this gap, we present LVLM-Compress-Bench, a framework to first thoroughly study the broad impact of compression on the generative performance of LVLMs with multi-modal input driven tasks. In specific, we consider two major classes of compression for autoregressive models, namely KV cache and weight compression, for the dynamically growing intermediate cache and static weights, respectively.   We use four LVLM variants of the popular LLaVA framework to present our analysis via integrating various state-of-the-art KV and weight compression methods including uniform, outlier-reduced, and group quantization for the KV cache and weights. With this framework we demonstrate on ten different multi-modal datasets with different capabilities including recognition, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, visual reasoning, hallucination and visual illusion identification, toxicity, stereotypes and bias. In specific, our framework demonstrates the compression impact on both general and ethically critical metrics leveraging a combination of real world and synthetic datasets to encompass diverse societal intersectional attributes. Extensive experimental evaluations yield diverse and intriguing observations on the behavior of LVLMs at different quantization budget of KV and weights, in both maintaining and losing performance as compared to the baseline model with FP16 data format.   Code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/opengear-project/LVLM-compress-bench.

### Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge   Reasoning
**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Orion Weller, Fabio Petroni, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2025-03-06T21:07:41Z

**Summary**: Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.

### Markov Chain of Thought for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Wen Yang, Minpeng Liao, Kai Fan

**Updated**: 2025-03-06T06:39:56Z

**Summary**: Chain of Thought (CoT) of multi-step benefits from the logical structure of the reasoning steps and task-specific actions, significantly enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. As the prevalence of long CoT, the number of reasoning steps exceeds manageable token limits and leads to higher computational demands. Inspired by the fundamental logic of human cognition, "derive, then reduce", we conceptualize the standard multi-step CoT as a novel Markov Chain of Thought (MCoT). In this study, we consider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text accompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path, self-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our MCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question, enabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache. In our experiments, we curate the $\texttt{MCoTInstruct}$ dataset, and the empirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency but also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this work paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/james-yw/Markov-Chain-of-Thought

### TUNA: Tuning Unstable and Noisy Cloud Applications
**Authors**: Johannes Freischuetz, Konstantinos Kanellis, Brian Kroth, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T20:36:51Z

**Summary**: Autotuning plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance of systems, particularly in large-scale cloud deployments. One of the main challenges in performing autotuning in the cloud arises from performance variability. We first investigate the extent to which noise slows autotuning and find that as little as $5\%$ noise can lead to a $2.5$x slowdown in converging to the best-performing configuration. We measure the magnitude of noise in cloud computing settings and find that while some components (CPU, disk) have almost no performance variability, there are still sources of significant variability (caches, memory). Furthermore, variability leads to autotuning finding unstable configurations. As many as $63.3\%$ of the configurations selected as "best" during tuning can have their performance degrade by $30\%$ or more when deployed. Using this as motivation, we propose a novel approach to improve the efficiency of autotuning systems by (a) detecting and removing outlier configurations and (b) using ML-based approaches to provide a more stable true signal of de-noised experiment results to the optimizer. The resulting system, TUNA (Tuning Unstable and Noisy Cloud Applications) enables faster convergence and robust configurations. Tuning postgres running mssales, an enterprise production workload, we find that TUNA can lead to $1.88$x lower running time on average with $2.58x$ lower standard deviation compared to traditional sampling methodologies.

### GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera   Control
**Authors**: Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Jiahui Huang, Huan Ling, Yifan Lu, Merlin Nimier-David, Thomas Müller, Alexander Keller, Sanja Fidler, Jun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

### StableToolBench: Towards Stable Large-Scale Benchmarking on Tool   Learning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhicheng Guo, Sijie Cheng, Hao Wang, Shihao Liang, Yujia Qin, Peng Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:39:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, prompting the exploration of tool learning, which integrates LLMs with external tools to address diverse real-world challenges. Assessing the capability of LLMs to utilise tools necessitates large-scale and stable benchmarks. However, previous works relied on either hand-crafted online tools with limited scale, or large-scale real online APIs suffering from instability of API status. To address this problem, we introduce StableToolBench, a benchmark evolving from ToolBench, proposing a virtual API server and stable evaluation system. The virtual API server contains a caching system and API simulators which are complementary to alleviate the change in API status. Meanwhile, the stable evaluation system designs solvable pass and win rates using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator to eliminate the randomness during evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability of StableToolBench, and further discuss the effectiveness of API simulators, the caching system, and the evaluator system.

### Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large Language Model Training Through   Chronos-aware Pipeline Parallelism
**Authors**: Xinyuan Lin, Chenlu Li, Zongle Huang, Chunyu Wang, Bo Xiao, Huazhong Yang, Shishi Duan, Yongpan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T04:54:50Z

**Summary**: Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.

### InfiniSST: Simultaneous Translation of Unbounded Speech with Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T19:51:29Z

**Summary**: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

### Q-Filters: Leveraging QK Geometry for Efficient KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Nathan Godey, Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini, Éric de la Clergerie, Benoît Sagot

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T17:37:49Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids re-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model sizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory bottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during generation. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and Key (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores without computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV Cache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on a single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives, Q-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct access to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings demonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression methods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming efficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups. Notably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task with a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by up to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.

### Efficient and Optimal No-Regret Caching under Partial Observation
**Authors**: Younes Ben Mazziane, Francescomaria Faticanti, Sara Alouf, Giovanni Neglia

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T16:21:33Z

**Summary**: Online learning algorithms have been successfully used to design caching policies with sublinear regret in the total number of requests, with no statistical assumption about the request sequence. Most existing algorithms involve computationally expensive operations and require knowledge of all past requests. However, this may not be feasible in practical scenarios like caching at a cellular base station. Therefore, we study the caching problem in a more restrictive setting where only a fraction of past requests are observed, and we propose a randomized caching policy with sublinear regret based on the classic online learning algorithm Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL). Our caching policy is the first to attain the asymptotically optimal regret bound while ensuring asymptotically constant amortized time complexity in the partial observability setting of requests. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed solution against classic caching policies and validates the proposed approach under synthetic and real-world request traces.

### Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code
**Authors**: Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T13:01:07Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.

### Q&C: When Quantization Meets Cache in Efficient Image Generation
**Authors**: Xin Ding, Xin Li, Haotong Qin, Zhibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T11:19:02Z

**Summary**: Quantization and cache mechanisms are typically applied individually for efficient Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), each demonstrating notable potential for acceleration. However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability. The code will be available at https://github.com/xinding-sys/Quant-Cache.

### Energy efficiency of cache eviction algorithms for Zipf distributed   objects
**Authors**: Emese Sziklay, Tamás Jursonovics

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T11:15:47Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a summary analysis of the Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Perfect Least Frequently Used (PLFU) cache eviction algorithms on real data, transferred on Content Delivery Nettworks (CDNs), as well as on Zipf distributed samples. In light of the growing emphasis on energy efficiency in CDNs in recent years due to rising energy costs, this paper considers and discusses the total CPU time required to run a cache algorithm. The total CPU time represents a novel metric for evaluating cache performance, and it is contrasted with the conventional Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) metric. Furthermore, a new algorithm with an admission policy and the eviction strategy that of PLFU is presented. The results demonstrate that it is a simple and straightforward algorithm to implement and offers high CHR and low CPU time.

### PersonaX: A Recommendation Agent Oriented User Modeling Framework for   Long Behavior Sequence
**Authors**: Yunxiao Shi, Wujiang Xu, Zeqi Zhang, Xing Zi, Qiang Wu, Min Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T08:41:40Z

**Summary**: Recommendation agents leverage large language models for user modeling LLM UM to construct textual personas guiding alignment with real users. However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality. Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent. PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.

**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Xinhao Luo, Junxian Guo, Wentao Ni, Yangjie Zhou, Yue Guan, Cong Guo, Weihao Cui, Yu Feng, Minyi Guo, Yuhao Zhu, Minjia Zhang, Jingwen Leng, Chen Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T03:18:56Z

**Summary**: In this work, we design and implement VQ-LLM, an efficient fused Vector Quantization (VQ) kernel generation framework. We first introduce a software abstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and support the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache adaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy, including off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers. Centered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine that optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This compute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations. Additionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in our optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an average latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared to existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36% to 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization methods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable, achieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent bit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy.

### RefreshKV: Updating Small KV Cache During Long-form Generation
**Authors**: Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T18:23:47Z

**Summary**: Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input is a very compute-intensive inference scenario for large language models (LLMs). One prominent inference speed-up approach is to construct a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show that continued pretraining with our inference setting brings further gains in performance.

### EliteKV: Scalable KV Cache Compression via RoPE Frequency Selection and   Joint Low-Rank Projection
**Authors**: Yuhao Zhou, Sirui Song, Boyang Liu, Zhiheng Xi, Senjie Jin, Xiaoran Fan, Zhihao Zhang, Wei Li, Xuanjing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T14:26:51Z

**Summary**: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) enables each attention head to capture multi-frequency information along the sequence dimension and is widely applied in foundation models. However, the nonlinearity introduced by RoPE complicates optimization of the key state in the Key-Value (KV) cache for RoPE-based attention. Existing KV cache compression methods typically store key state before rotation and apply the transformation during decoding, introducing additional computational overhead. This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible modification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache compression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference of each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain dimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint low-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing. Experimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\%$ of the original training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\%$ reduction in KV cache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin. Furthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different scales within the same family.

### KurTail : Kurtosis-based LLM Quantization
**Authors**: Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh, Aleksandar Bojchevski, Evangelos Eleftheriou, Martino Dazzi

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T12:43:06Z

**Summary**: One of the challenges of quantizing a large language model (LLM) is the presence of outliers. Outliers often make uniform quantization schemes less effective, particularly in extreme cases such as 4-bit quantization. We introduce KurTail, a new post-training quantization (PTQ) scheme that leverages Kurtosis-based rotation to mitigate outliers in the activations of LLMs. Our method optimizes Kurtosis as a measure of tailedness. This approach enables the quantization of weights, activations, and the KV cache in 4 bits. We utilize layer-wise optimization, ensuring memory efficiency. KurTail outperforms existing quantization methods, offering a 13.3\% boost in MMLU accuracy and a 15.5\% drop in Wiki perplexity compared to QuaRot. It also outperforms SpinQuant with a 2.6\% MMLU gain and reduces perplexity by 2.9\%, all while reducing the training cost. For comparison, learning the rotation using SpinQuant for Llama3-70B requires at least four NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs, whereas our method requires only a single GPU, making it a more accessible solution for consumer GPU.

**Summary**: Stencil computation is essential in high-performance computing, especially for large-scale tasks like liquid simulation and weather forecasting. Optimizing its performance can reduce both energy consumption and computation time, which is critical in disaster prediction. This paper explores optimization techniques for 7-point 3D stencil computation on ARM's Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), using the Roofline model and tools like Gem5 and cacti. We evaluate software optimizations such as vectorization and tiling, as well as hardware adjustments in ARM SVE vector lengths and cache configurations. The study also examines performance, power consumption, and chip area trade-offs to identify optimal configurations for ARM-based systems.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) use key-value (KV) cache to reduce redundant computation in autoregressive generation. However, the KV cache size increases linearly during generation, leading to excessive memory usage, especially for long texts. Most KV cache compression methods evict the unimportant KV pairs to maintain a fixed cache size, which leads to the permanent loss of tokens during generation. However, singular value decomposition shows that \textit{values} do not exhibit a strong low-rank property as \textit{keys} do, suggesting that information is distributed more evenly across \textit{values}, in contrast to its more redundant distribution within \textit{keys}. Therefore, methods that evict both \textit{keys} and \textit{values} risk losing crucial information and compromise context integrity, ultimately degrading the output quality. To address this problem, we propose WeightedKV, a novel, training-free approach that discards the \textit{keys} of less important tokens, while merging their \textit{values} into neighboring tokens via a convex combination weighted by their average attention scores. In this way, the retained \textit{keys} serve as anchors that guide the generation process, while the merged \textit{values} provide a rich contextual backdrop. We assess our method on four widely used language modeling datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to all baseline methods, particularly with a lower budget ratio.

 ### MusicInfuser: Making Video Diffusion Listen and Dance
**Authors**: Susung Hong, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Brian Curless, Steven M. Seitz

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to a specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models. We introduce an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs to assess multiple dimensions of dance generation quality. The project page and code are available at https://susunghong.github.io/MusicInfuser.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can handle a wide variety of general tasks with simple prompts, without the need for task-specific training. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms. This work seeks to help researchers organize current advancements in the field and inspire better alignment methods.

**Authors**: Jiacheng Guo, Yue Wu, Jiahao Qiu, Kaixuan Huang, Xinzhe Juan, Ling Yang, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:58:28Z

**Summary**: Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning. We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jcguo123/Temporal-Consistency

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:57:54Z

**Summary**: We introduce Cosmos-Transfer, a conditional world generation model that can generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge. In the design, the spatial conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable. It allows weighting different conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations. This enables highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world transfer use cases, including Sim2Real. We conduct extensive evaluations to analyze the proposed model and demonstrate its applications for Physical AI, including robotics Sim2Real and autonomous vehicle data enrichment. We further demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation with an NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack. To help accelerate research development in the field, we open-source our models and code at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1.

### Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction   of Programs
**Authors**: Shraddha Surana, Ashwin Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:57:16Z

**Summary**: We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.

### Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration
**Authors**: Fardin Saad, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Munindar P. Singh

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:54:14Z

**Summary**: Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.

### Deep Jansen-Rit Parameter Inference for Model-Driven Analysis of Brain   Activity
**Authors**: Deepa Tilwani, Christian O'Reilly

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:52:33Z

**Summary**: Accurately modeling effective connectivity (EC) is critical for understanding how the brain processes and integrates sensory information. Yet, it remains a formidable challenge due to complex neural dynamics and noisy measurements such as those obtained from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Model-driven EC infers local (within a brain region) and global (between brain regions) EC parameters by fitting a generative model of neural activity onto experimental data. This approach offers a promising route for various applications, including investigating neurodevelopmental disorders. However, current approaches fail to scale to whole-brain analyses and are highly noise-sensitive. In this work, we employ three deep-learning architectures--a transformer, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a convolutional neural network and bidirectional LSTM (CNN-BiLSTM) network--for inverse modeling and compare their performance with simulation-based inference in estimating the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) parameters from simulated EEG data under various noise conditions. We demonstrate a reliable estimation of key local parameters, such as synaptic gains and time constants. However, other parameters like local JR-NMM connectivity cannot be evaluated reliably from evoked-related potentials (ERP). We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to characterize the influence of JR-NMM parameters on ERP and evaluate their learnability. Our results show the feasibility of deep-learning approaches to estimate the subset of learnable JR-NMM parameters.

### Sparse Autoencoders for Hypothesis Generation
**Authors**: Rajiv Movva, Kenny Peng, Nikhil Garg, Jon Kleinberg, Emma Pierson

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:51:56Z

**Summary**: We describe HypotheSAEs, a general method to hypothesize interpretable relationships between text data (e.g., headlines) and a target variable (e.g., clicks). HypotheSAEs has three steps: (1) train a sparse autoencoder on text embeddings to produce interpretable features describing the data distribution, (2) select features that predict the target variable, and (3) generate a natural language interpretation of each feature (e.g., "mentions being surprised or shocked") using an LLM. Each interpretation serves as a hypothesis about what predicts the target variable. Compared to baselines, our method better identifies reference hypotheses on synthetic datasets (at least +0.06 in F1) and produces more predictive hypotheses on real datasets (~twice as many significant findings), despite requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less compute than recent LLM-based methods. HypotheSAEs also produces novel discoveries on two well-studied tasks: explaining partisan differences in Congressional speeches and identifying drivers of engagement with online headlines.

### Creation-MMBench: Assessing Context-Aware Creative Intelligence in MLLM
**Authors**: Xinyu Fang, Zhijian Chen, Kai Lan, Shengyuan Ding, Yingji Liang, Xiangyu Zhao, Farong Wen, Zicheng Zhang, Guofeng Zhang, Haodong Duan, Kai Chen, Dahua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:51:34Z

**Summary**: Creativity is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, involving the ability to generate novel and appropriate solutions across diverse contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence. Full data and evaluation code is released on https://github.com/open-compass/Creation-MMBench.

### Calibrating Verbal Uncertainty as a Linear Feature to Reduce   Hallucinations
**Authors**: Ziwei Ji, Lei Yu, Yeskendir Koishekenov, Yejin Bang, Anthony Hartshorn, Alan Schelten, Cheng Zhang, Pascale Fung, Nicola Cancedda

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:51:04Z

**Summary**: LLMs often adopt an assertive language style also when making false claims. Such ``overconfident hallucinations'' mislead users and erode trust. Achieving the ability to express in language the actual degree of uncertainty around a claim is therefore of great importance. We find that ``verbal uncertainty'' is governed by a single linear feature in the representation space of LLMs, and show that this has only moderate correlation with the actual ``semantic uncertainty'' of the model. We apply this insight and show that (1) the mismatch between semantic and verbal uncertainty is a better predictor of hallucinations than semantic uncertainty alone and (2) we can intervene on verbal uncertainty at inference time and reduce hallucinations on short-form answers, achieving an average relative reduction of 32%.

### LLMs as Models for Analogical Reasoning
**Authors**: Sam Musker, Alex Duchnowski, Raphaël Millière, Ellie Pavlick

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:49:06Z

**Summary**: Analogical reasoning-the capacity to identify and map structural relationships between different domains-is fundamental to human cognition and learning. Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can sometimes match humans in analogical reasoning tasks, opening the possibility that analogical reasoning might emerge from domain general processes. However, it is still debated whether these emergent capacities are largely superficial and limited to simple relations seen during training or whether they rather encompass the flexible representational and mapping capabilities which are the focus of leading cognitive models of analogy. In this study, we introduce novel analogical reasoning tasks that require participants to map between semantically contentful words and sequences of letters and other abstract characters. This task necessitates the ability to flexibly re-represent rich semantic information-an ability which is known to be central to human analogy but which is thus far not well-captured by existing cognitive theories and models. We assess the performance of both human participants and LLMs on tasks focusing on reasoning from semantic structure and semantic content, introducing variations that test the robustness of their analogical inferences. Advanced LLMs match human performance across several conditions, though humans and LLMs respond differently to certain task variations and semantic distractors. Our results thus provide new evidence that LLMs might offer a how-possibly explanation of human analogical reasoning in contexts that are not yet well modeled by existing theories, but that even today's best models are unlikely to yield how-actually explanations.

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:49:06Z

**Summary**: Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.

### Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference
**Authors**: Yulun Wu, Louie McConnell, Claudia Iriondo

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:48:13Z

**Summary**: Estimating an individual's counterfactual outcomes under interventions is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in the observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage disentangled exogenous noise abduction that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.

### Powerful batch conformal prediction for classification
**Authors**: Ulysse Gazin, Ruth Heller, Etienne Roquain, Aldo Solari

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:38:37Z

**Summary**: In a split conformal framework with $K$ classes, a calibration sample of $n$ labeled examples is observed for inference on the label of a new unlabeled example. We explore the setting where a `batch' of $m$ independent such unlabeled examples is given, and the goal is to construct a batch prediction set with 1-$\alpha$ coverage. Unlike individual prediction sets, the batch prediction set is a collection of label vectors of size $m$, while the calibration sample consists of univariate labels. A natural approach is to apply the Bonferroni correction, which concatenates individual prediction sets at level $1-\alpha/m$. We propose a uniformly more powerful solution, based on specific combinations of conformal $p$-values that exploit the Simes inequality. We provide a general recipe for valid inference with any combinations of conformal $p$-values, and compare the performance of several useful choices. Intuitively, the pooled evidence of relatively `easy' examples within the batch can help provide narrower batch prediction sets. Additionally, we introduce a more computationally intensive method that aggregates batch scores and can be even more powerful. The theoretical guarantees are established when all examples are independent and identically distributed (iid), as well as more generally when iid is assumed only conditionally within each class. Notably, our results remain valid under label distribution shift, since the distribution of the labels need not be the same in the calibration sample and in the new batch. The effectiveness of the methods is highlighted through illustrative synthetic and real data examples.

### Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). I. Ordered   massive star formation in the outer Galaxy
**Authors**: Yu Cheng, Jonathan C. Tan, Morten Andersen, Rubén Fedriani, Yichen Zhang, Massimo Robberto, Zhi-Yun Li, Kei E. I. Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:36:26Z

**Summary**: Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\odot$, is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multi-facility survey, including observations with {\it JWST}, {\it ALMA}, {\it HST}, {\it Chandra} and {\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\it JWST} and {\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the {\it JWST} field of view and the {\it ALMA} observations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The {\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of $\sim11\:M_\odot$ has formed from an initially $\sim100\:M_\odot$ core over the last $\sim3\times10^5$ years. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.

### Doubly robust identification of treatment effects from multiple   environments
**Authors**: Piersilvio De Bartolomeis, Julia Kostin, Javier Abad, Yixin Wang, Fanny Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:33:10Z

**Summary**: Practical and ethical constraints often require the use of observational data for causal inference, particularly in medicine and social sciences. Yet, observational datasets are prone to confounding, potentially compromising the validity of causal conclusions. While it is possible to correct for biases if the underlying causal graph is known, this is rarely a feasible ask in practical scenarios. A common strategy is to adjust for all available covariates, yet this approach can yield biased treatment effect estimates, especially when post-treatment or unobserved variables are present. We propose RAMEN, an algorithm that produces unbiased treatment effect estimates by leveraging the heterogeneity of multiple data sources without the need to know or learn the underlying causal graph. Notably, RAMEN achieves doubly robust identification: it can identify the treatment effect whenever the causal parents of the treatment or those of the outcome are observed, and the node whose parents are observed satisfies an invariance assumption. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods.

### RWKV-7 "Goose" with Expressive Dynamic State Evolution

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:31:05Z

**Summary**: We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture, along with pre-trained language models that establish a new state-of-the-art in downstream performance at the 3 billion parameter scale on multilingual tasks, and match current SoTA English language performance despite being trained on dramatically fewer tokens than other top 3B models. Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.   To foster openness, reproduction, and adoption, we release our models and dataset component listing at https://huggingface.co/RWKV, and our training and inference code at https://github.com/RWKV/RWKV-LM all under the Apache 2.0 License.

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:30:26Z

**Summary**: We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\ln k = 0.0062 \pm 0.0052$) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\rm eff} = 2.86 \pm 0.13$, which combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\rm eff} = 2.89 \pm 0.11$), for non-zero neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu < 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation ($N_{\rm idr} < 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.

**Authors**: Stanislaw Szymanowicz, Jason Y. Zhang, Pratul Srinivasan, Ruiqi Gao, Arthur Brussee, Aleksander Holynski, Ricardo Martin-Brualla, Jonathan T. Barron, Philipp Henzler

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:24:19Z

**Summary**: We present a latent diffusion model for fast feed-forward 3D scene generation. Given one or more images, our model Bolt3D directly samples a 3D scene representation in less than seven seconds on a single GPU. We achieve this by leveraging powerful and scalable existing 2D diffusion network architectures to produce consistent high-fidelity 3D scene representations. To train this model, we create a large-scale multiview-consistent dataset of 3D geometry and appearance by applying state-of-the-art dense 3D reconstruction techniques to existing multiview image datasets. Compared to prior multiview generative models that require per-scene optimization for 3D reconstruction, Bolt3D reduces the inference cost by a factor of up to 300 times.

### EnvBench: A Benchmark for Automated Environment Setup
**Authors**: Aleksandra Eliseeva, Alexander Kovrigin, Ilia Kholkin, Egor Bogomolov, Yaroslav Zharov

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:19:12Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled researchers to focus on practical repository-level tasks in software engineering domain. In this work, we consider a cornerstone task for automating work with software repositories-environment setup, i.e., a task of configuring a repository-specific development environment on a system. Existing studies on environment setup introduce innovative agentic strategies, but their evaluation is often based on small datasets that may not capture the full range of configuration challenges encountered in practice. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive environment setup benchmark EnvBench. It encompasses 329 Python and 665 JVM-based (Java, Kotlin) repositories, with a focus on repositories that present genuine configuration challenges, excluding projects that can be fully configured by simple deterministic scripts. To enable further benchmark extension and usage for model tuning, we implement two automatic metrics: a static analysis check for missing imports in Python and a compilation check for JVM languages. We demonstrate the applicability of our benchmark by evaluating three environment setup approaches, including a simple zero-shot baseline and two agentic workflows, that we test with two powerful LLM backbones, GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best approach manages to successfully configure 6.69% repositories for Python and 29.47% repositories for JVM, suggesting that EnvBench remains challenging for current approaches. Our benchmark suite is publicly available at https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/EnvBench. The dataset and experiment trajectories are available at https://jb.gg/envbench.

### A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam:   MufassirQAS LLM
**Authors**: Ahmet Yusuf Alan, Enis Karaarslan, Ömer Aydin

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:14:43Z

**Summary**: Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.

### Efficient Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Dynamic Block-Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Emily Xiao, Chin-Jou Li, Yilin Zhang, Graham Neubig, Amanda Bertsch

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:13:42Z

**Summary**: Many-shot in-context learning has recently shown promise as an alternative to finetuning, with the major advantage that the same model can be served for multiple tasks. However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale.

### LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as   Evolutionary Optimizers
**Authors**: Nikhil Abhyankar, Parshin Shojaee, Chandan K. Reddy

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:11:24Z

**Summary**: Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.

### PLAY2PROMPT: Zero-shot Tool Instruction Optimization for LLM Agents via   Tool Play
**Authors**: Wei Fang, Yang Zhang, Kaizhi Qian, James Glass, Yada Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:09:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.

**Authors**: Junfeng Jiao, Saleh Afroogh, Yiming Xu, Connor Phillips

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:57:17Z

**Summary**: This study addresses ethical issues surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) within the field of artificial intelligence. It explores the common ethical challenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and fairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It highlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and decoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from those encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to tackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance transparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information dissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM ethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical frameworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to diverse contexts. This roadmap aims to guide responsible development and integration of LLMs, envisioning a future where ethical considerations govern AI advancements in society.

### Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal   Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siwei Zhang, Yun Xiong, Yateng Tang, Xi Chen, Zian Jia, Zehao Gu, Jiarong Xu, Jiawei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:50:10Z

**Summary**: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.

### Inference and Learning of Nonlinear LFR State-space Models
**Authors**: Merijn Floren, Jean-Philippe Noël, Jan Swevers

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:49:56Z

**Summary**: Estimating the parameters of nonlinear block-oriented state-space models from input-output data typically involves solving a highly non-convex optimization problem, making it susceptible to poor local minima and slow convergence. This paper presents a computationally efficient initialization method for fully parametrizing nonlinear linear fractional representation (NL-LFR) models using periodic data. The approach first infers the latent variables and then estimates the model parameters, yielding initial estimates that serve as a starting point for further nonlinear optimization. The proposed method shows robustness against poor local minima, and achieves a twofold error reduction compared to the state-of-the-art on a challenging benchmark dataset.

**Authors**: Junfeng Jiao, Saleh Afroogh, Kevin Chen, David Atkinson, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:42:30Z

**Summary**: The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in academia has spurred a global discourse on their potential pedagogical benefits and ethical considerations. Positive reactions highlight some potential, such as collaborative creativity, increased access to education, and empowerment of trainers and trainees. However, negative reactions raise concerns about ethical complexities, balancing innovation and academic integrity, unequal access, and misinformation risks. Through a systematic survey and text-mining-based analysis of global and national directives, insights from independent research, and eighty university-level guidelines, this study provides a nuanced understanding of the opportunities and challenges posed by GAI and LLMs in education. It emphasizes the importance of balanced approaches that harness the benefits of these technologies while addressing ethical considerations and ensuring equitable access and educational outcomes. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering responsible innovation and ethical practices to guide the integration of GAI and LLMs in academia.

### To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve? Uncertainty Detection for Dynamic   Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Kaustubh D. Dhole

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:42:17Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation equips large language models with the capability to retrieve external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations by incorporating information beyond the model's intrinsic abilities. However, most prior works have focused on invoking retrieval deterministically, which makes it unsuitable for tasks such as long-form question answering. Instead, dynamically performing retrieval by invoking it only when the underlying LLM lacks the required knowledge can be more efficient. In this context, we delve deeper into the question, "To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve?" by exploring multiple uncertainty detection methods. We evaluate these methods for the task of long-form question answering, employing dynamic retrieval, and present our comparisons. Our findings suggest that uncertainty detection metrics, such as Degree Matrix Jaccard and Eccentricity, can reduce the number of retrieval calls by almost half, with only a slight reduction in question-answering accuracy.

### Towards Aligning Language Models with Textual Feedback
**Authors**: Saüc Abadal Lloret, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Keerthiram Murugesan, Mrinmaya Sachan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:34:14Z

**Summary**: We present ALT (ALignment with Textual feedback), an approach that aligns language models with user preferences expressed in text. We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing constrained and unconstrained textual feedback. We also outline future directions to align models with natural language feedback.

### From "Hallucination" to "Suture": Insights from Language Philosophy to   Enhance Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiantong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:27:01Z

**Summary**: This paper explores hallucination phenomena in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of language philosophy and psychoanalysis. By incorporating Lacan's concepts of the "chain of signifiers" and "suture points," we propose the Anchor-RAG framework as a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations. In contrast to the predominant reliance on trial-and-error experiments, constant adjustments of mathematical formulas, or resource-intensive methods that emphasize quantity over quality, our approach returns to the fundamental principles of linguistics to analyze the root causes of hallucinations in LLMs. Drawing from robust theoretical foundations, we derive algorithms and models that are not only effective in reducing hallucinations but also enhance LLM performance and improve output quality. This paper seeks to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding hallucinations in LLMs and aims to challenge the prevalent "guess-and-test" approach and rat race mentality in the field. We aspire to pave the way for a new era of interpretable LLMs, offering deeper insights into the inner workings of language-based AI systems.

### How much do LLMs learn from negative examples?
**Authors**: Shadi Hamdan, Deniz Yuret

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:26:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) undergo a three-phase training process: unsupervised pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and learning from human feedback (RLHF/DPO). Notably, it is during the final phase that these models are exposed to negative examples -- incorrect, rejected, or suboptimal responses to queries. This paper delves into the role of negative examples in the training of LLMs, using a likelihood-ratio (Likra) model on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks to precisely manage the influence and the volume of negative examples. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) During a critical phase in training, Likra with negative examples demonstrates a significantly larger improvement per training example compared to SFT using only positive examples. This leads to a sharp jump in the learning curve for Likra unlike the smooth and gradual improvement of SFT; (2) negative examples that are plausible but incorrect (near-misses) exert a greater influence; and (3) while training with positive examples fails to significantly decrease the likelihood of plausible but incorrect answers, training with negative examples more accurately identifies them. These results indicate a potentially significant role for negative examples in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations for LLMs.

### Good/Evil Reputation Judgment of Celebrities by LLMs via Retrieval   Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Rikuto Tsuchida, Hibiki Yokoyama, Takehito Utsuro

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:15:55Z

**Summary**: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs) can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.

### OVTR: End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with   Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyang Li, En Yu, Sijia Chen, Wenbing Tao

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:12:19Z

**Summary**: Open-vocabulary multiple object tracking aims to generalize trackers to unseen categories during training, enabling their application across a variety of real-world scenarios. However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability. Models and code are released at https://github.com/jinyanglii/OVTR.

### On the Standard Performance Criteria for Applied Control Design: PID,   MPC or Machine Learning Controller?
**Authors**: Pouria Sarhadi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:12:04Z

**Summary**: The traditional control theory and its application to basic and complex systems have reached an advanced level of maturity. This includes aerial, marine, and ground vehicles, as well as robotics, chemical, transportation, and electrical systems widely used in our daily lives. The emerging era of data-driven methods, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-based controllers does not indicate a weakness in well-established control theory. Instead, it aims to reduce dependence on models and uncertainties, address increasingly complex systems, and potentially achieve decision-making capabilities comparable to human-level performance. This revolution integrates knowledge from computer science, machine learning, biology, and classical control, producing promising algorithms that are yet to demonstrate widespread real-world applicability. Despite the maturity of control theory and the presence of various performance criteria, there is still a lack of standardised metrics for testing, evaluation, Verification and Validation ($V\&V$) of algorithms. This gap can lead to algorithms that, while optimal in certain aspects, may fall short of practical implementation, sparking debates within the literature. For a controller to succeed in real-world applications, it must satisfy three key categories of performance metrics: tracking quality, control effort (energy consumption), and robustness. This paper rather takes an applied perspective, proposing and consolidating standard performance criteria for testing and analysing control systems, intended for researchers and students. The proposed framework ensures the post-design applicability of a black-box algorithm, aligning with modern data analysis and $V\&V$ perspectives to prevent resource allocation to systems with limited impact or imprecise claims.

### Impossible Videos
**Authors**: Zechen Bai, Hai Ci, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:10:24Z

**Summary**: Synthetic videos nowadays is widely used to complement data scarcity and diversity of real-world videos. Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.

### Collaborative Instance Object Navigation: Leveraging   Uncertainty-Awareness to Minimize Human-Agent Dialogues
**Authors**: Francesco Taioli, Edoardo Zorzi, Gianni Franchi, Alberto Castellini, Alessandro Farinelli, Marco Cristani, Yiming Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:09:20Z

**Summary**: Language-driven instance object navigation assumes that human users initiate the task by providing a detailed description of the target instance to the embodied agent. While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes. Code and benchmark will be available upon acceptance at https://intelligolabs.github.io/CoIN/

### Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion   Language Models
**Authors**: Marianne Arriola, Aaron Gokaslan, Justin T Chiu, Zhihan Yang, Zhixuan Qi, Jiaqi Han, Subham Sekhar Sahoo, Volodymyr Kuleshov

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:58:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on the project page: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/

### CryptoLLM: Unleashing the Power of Prompted LLMs for SmartQnA and   Classification of Crypto Posts
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:49:08Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of social media has resulted in an large volume of user-generated content, particularly in niche domains such as cryptocurrency. This task focuses on developing robust classification models to accurately categorize cryptocurrency-related social media posts into predefined classes, including but not limited to objective, positive, negative, etc. Additionally, the task requires participants to identify the most relevant answers from a set of posts in response to specific questions. By leveraging advanced LLMs, this research aims to enhance the understanding and filtering of cryptocurrency discourse, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in this volatile sector. We have used a prompt-based technique to solve the classification task for reddit posts and twitter posts. Also, we have used 64-shot technique along with prompts on GPT-4-Turbo model to determine whether a answer is relevant to a question or not.

### Unified Analysis of Decentralized Gradient Descent: a Contraction   Mapping Framework
**Authors**: Erik G. Larsson, Nicolo Michelusi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:36:36Z

**Summary**: The decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, and its sibling, diffusion, are workhorses in decentralized machine learning, distributed inference and estimation, and multi-agent coordination. We propose a novel, principled framework for the analysis of DGD and diffusion for strongly convex, smooth objectives, and arbitrary undirected topologies, using contraction mappings coupled with a result called the mean Hessian theorem (MHT). The use of these tools yields tight convergence bounds, both in the noise-free and noisy regimes. While these bounds are qualitatively similar to results found in the literature, our approach using contractions together with the MHT decouples the algorithm dynamics (how quickly the algorithm converges to its fixed point) from its asymptotic convergence properties (how far the fixed point is from the global optimum). This yields a simple, intuitive analysis that is accessible to a broader audience. Extensions are provided to multiple local gradient updates, time-varying step sizes, noisy gradients (stochastic DGD and diffusion), communication noise, and random topologies.

### Cancer-Answer: Empowering Cancer Care with Advanced Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:36:28Z

**Summary**: Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers account for a substantial portion of the global cancer burden, where early diagnosis is critical for improved management and patient outcomes. The complex aetiologies and overlapping symptoms across GI cancers often delay diagnosis, leading to suboptimal treatment strategies. Cancer-related queries are crucial for timely diagnosis, treatment, and patient education, as access to accurate, comprehensive information can significantly influence outcomes. However, the complexity of cancer as a disease, combined with the vast amount of available data, makes it difficult for clinicians and patients to quickly find precise answers. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses to cancer-related queries. Pre-trained with medical data, these models provide timely, actionable insights that support informed decision-making in cancer diagnosis and care, ultimately improving patient outcomes. We calculate two metrics: A1 (which represents the fraction of entities present in the model-generated answer compared to the gold standard) and A2 (which represents the linguistic correctness and meaningfulness of the model-generated answer with respect to the gold standard), achieving maximum values of 0.546 and 0.881, respectively.

### Hadamard Attention Recurrent Transformer: A Strong Baseline for Stereo   Matching Transformer
**Authors**: Ziyang Chen, Yongjun Zhang, Wenting Li, Bingshu Wang, Yabo Wu, Yong Zhao, C. L. Philip Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:30:22Z

**Summary**: In light of the advancements in transformer technology, extant research posits the construction of stereo transformers as a potential solution to the binocular stereo matching challenge. However, constrained by the low-rank bottleneck and quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, stereo transformers still fail to demonstrate sufficient nonlinear expressiveness within a reasonable inference time. The lack of focus on key homonymous points renders the representations of such methods vulnerable to challenging conditions, including reflections and weak textures. Furthermore, a slow computing speed is not conducive to the application. To overcome these difficulties, we present the Hadamard Attention Recurrent Stereo Transformer (HART) that incorporates the following components: 1) For faster inference, we present a Hadamard product paradigm for the attention mechanism, achieving linear computational complexity. 2) We designed a Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) to amplify the differences between relevant and irrelevant feature responses. This allows HART to focus on important details. DAK also converts zero elements to non-zero elements to mitigate the reduced expressiveness caused by the low-rank bottleneck. 3) To compensate for the spatial and channel interaction missing in the Hadamard product, we propose MKOI to capture both global and local information through the interleaving of large and small kernel convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART. In reflective area, HART ranked 1st on the KITTI 2012 benchmark among all published methods at the time of submission. Code is available at https://github.com/ZYangChen/HART.

### DreamRunner: Fine-Grained Compositional Story-to-Video Generation with   Retrieval-Augmented Motion Adaptation
**Authors**: Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:19:15Z

**Summary**: Storytelling video generation (SVG) aims to produce coherent and visually rich multi-scene videos that follow a structured narrative. Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and muti-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.

### MANTRA: Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG   and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration
**Authors**: Yisen Xu, Feng Lin, Jinqiu Yang, Tse-Hsun, Chen, Nikolaos Tsantalis

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:16:51Z

**Summary**: Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.

### Partially Directed Configuration Model with Homophily and   Respondent-Driven Sampling
**Authors**: Alejandro Sepulveda-Peñaloza, Isabelle S. Beaudry

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:12:28Z

**Summary**: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a sampling scheme used in socially connected human populations lacking a sampling frame. One of the first steps to make design-based inferences from RDS data is to estimate the sampling probabilities. A classical approach for such estimation assumes that a first-order Markov chain over a fully connected and undirected network may adequately represent RDS. This convenient model, however, does not reflect that the network may be directed and homophilous. The methods proposed in this work aim to address this issue. The main methodological contributions of this manuscript are two fold: first, we introduce a partially directed and homophilous network configuration model, and second, we develop two mathematical representations of the RDS sampling process over the proposed configuration model. Our simulation study shows that the resulting sampling probabilities are similar to those of RDS, and they improve the prevalence estimation under various realistic scenarios.

### InteLiPlan: An Interactive Lightweight LLM-Based Planner for Domestic   Robot Autonomy
**Authors**: Kim Tien Ly, Kai Lu, Ioannis Havoutis

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:03:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce an interactive LLM-based framework designed to enhance the autonomy and robustness of domestic robots, targeting embodied intelligence. Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR). Our method achieves a 93% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art large-scale LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.

### EvolvingGrasp: Evolutionary Grasp Generation via Efficient Preference   Alignment
**Authors**: Yufei Zhu, Yiming Zhong, Zemin Yang, Peishan Cong, Jingyi Yu, Xinge Zhu, Yuexin Ma

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T08:55:21Z

**Summary**: Dexterous robotic hands often struggle to generalize effectively in complex environments due to the limitations of models trained on low-diversity data. However, the real world presents an inherently unbounded range of scenarios, making it impractical to account for every possible variation. A natural solution is to enable robots learning from experience in complex environments, an approach akin to evolution, where systems improve through continuous feedback, learning from both failures and successes, and iterating toward optimal performance. Motivated by this, we propose EvolvingGrasp, an evolutionary grasp generation method that continuously enhances grasping performance through efficient preference alignment. Specifically, we introduce Handpose wise Preference Optimization (HPO), which allows the model to continuously align with preferences from both positive and negative feedback while progressively refining its grasping strategies. To further enhance efficiency and reliability during online adjustments, we incorporate a Physics-aware Consistency Model within HPO, which accelerates inference, reduces the number of timesteps needed for preference finetuning, and ensures physical plausibility throughout the process. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate state of the art performance of our method in grasp success rate and sampling efficiency. Our results validate that EvolvingGrasp enables evolutionary grasp generation, ensuring robust, physically feasible, and preference-aligned grasping in both simulation and real scenarios.

### LeanVAE: An Ultra-Efficient Reconstruction VAE for Video Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Yu Cheng, Fajie Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:58:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) have revolutionized video generation by leveraging Video Variational Autoencoders (Video VAEs) to compress intricate video data into a compact latent space. However, as LVDM training scales, the computational overhead of Video VAEs becomes a critical bottleneck, particularly for encoding high-resolution videos. To address this, we propose LeanVAE, a novel and ultra-efficient Video VAE framework that introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight architecture based on a Neighborhood-Aware Feedforward (NAF) module and non-overlapping patch operations, drastically reducing computational cost, and (2) the integration of wavelet transforms and compressed sensing techniques to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments validate LeanVAE's superiority in video reconstruction and generation, particularly in enhancing efficiency over existing Video VAEs. Our model offers up to 50x fewer FLOPs and 44x faster inference speed while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, providing insights for scalable, efficient video generation. Our models and code are available at https://github.com/westlake-repl/LeanVAE

### LLM-Match: An Open-Sourced Patient Matching Model Based on Large   Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Xiaodi Li, Shaika Chowdhury, Chung Il Wi, Maria Vassilaki, Ken Liu, Terence T Sio, Owen Garrick, Young J Juhn, James R Cerhan, Cui Tao, Nansu Zong

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:56:41Z

**Summary**: Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets - n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022 - using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.

### COPA: Comparing the Incomparable to Explore the Pareto Front
**Authors**: Adrián Javaloy, Antonio Vergari, Isabel Valera

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:51:42Z

**Summary**: In machine learning (ML), it is common to account for multiple objectives when, e.g., selecting a model to deploy. However, it is often unclear how one should compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, as they might be measured in different units or scales. For example, when deploying large language models (LLMs), we might not only care about their performance, but also their CO2 consumption. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be sensibly compared and aggregated to navigate their Pareto front. To do so, we propose to make incomparable objectives comparable via their CDFs, approximated by their relative rankings. This allows us to aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of our methodology in diverse areas such as LLM selection, domain generalization, and AutoML benchmarking, where classical ways to aggregate and normalize objectives fail.

### Relativisitic non-pascalian fluid as a density contribution
**Authors**: Justo Ospino, Daniel Suárez-Urango, Laura M. Becerra, Héctor Hernández, Luis A. Núñez

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:46:11Z

**Summary**: Understanding the role of pressure anisotropy and dissipation is crucial for modelling compact objects' internal structure and observable properties. In this work, we reinterpret local pressure anisotropy in relativistic stellar structures as an additional contribution to the energy density. This perspective enables the formulation of anisotropic equations of state for self-gravitating systems by incorporating anisotropy as a fundamental component. We demonstrate that this approach yields more realistic stellar models that satisfy key physical constraints, including mass-radius relationships and stability conditions. Our results are compared with observational data, particularly the inferred compactness of pulsars PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, showing that both anisotropic and isotropic models can describe these objects. Additionally, we examine the influence of dissipation -- such as temperature gradients -- on radial pressure, demonstrating that it can be modelled similarly to anisotropy. This interpretation allows the transformation of dissipative anisotropic models into equivalent non-dissipative isotropic configurations.

### Inference for Log-Gaussian Cox Point Processes using Bayesian Deep   Learning: Application to Human Oral Microbiome Image Data
**Authors**: Shuwan Wang, Christopher K. Wikle, Athanasios C. Micheas, Jessica L. Mark Welch, Jacqueline R. Starr, Kyu Ha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:39:38Z

**Summary**: It is common in nature to see aggregation of objects in space. Exploring the mechanism associated with the locations of such clustered observations can be essential to understanding the phenomenon, such as the source of spatial heterogeneity, or comparison to other event generating processes in the same domain. Log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs) represent an important class of models for quantifying aggregation in a spatial point pattern. However, implementing likelihood-based Bayesian inference for such models presents many computational challenges, particularly in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel likelihood-free inference approach for LGCPs using the recently developed BayesFlow approach, where invertible neural networks are employed to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. BayesFlow is a neural simulation-based method based on "amortized" posterior estimation. That is, after an initial training procedure, fast feed-forward operations allow rapid posterior inference for any data within the same model family. Comprehensive numerical studies validate the reliability of the framework and show that BayesFlow achieves substantial computational gain in repeated application, especially for two-dimensional LGCPs. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of the method by applying it to two distinct oral microbial biofilm images.

### Leveraging LLMS for Top-Down Sector Allocation In Automated Trading
**Authors**: Ryan Quek Wei Heng, Edoardo Vittori, Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Erik Cambria, Gianmarco Mengaldo

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:37:14Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sector-level portfolio allocation through systematic analysis of macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment. Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.

### Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE: Stable and efficient reinforcement   learning for LLMs
**Authors**: Nicolas Le Roux, Marc G. Bellemare, Jonathan Lebensold, Arnaud Bergeron, Joshua Greaves, Alex Fréchette, Carolyne Pelletier, Eric Thibodeau-Laufer Sándor Toth, Samantha Work

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:23:37Z

**Summary**: We propose a new algorithm for fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning. Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. We show that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the ``wasted inference'' that comes with discarding negative examples. We find that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling us to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, we find that REINFORCE's baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance.

### XOXO: Stealthy Cross-Origin Context Poisoning Attacks against AI Coding   Assistants
**Authors**: Adam Štorek, Mukur Gupta, Noopur Bhatt, Aditya Gupta, Janie Kim, Prashast Srivastava, Suman Jana

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:20:54Z

**Summary**: AI coding assistants are widely used for tasks like code generation, bug detection, and comprehension. These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code, overlooking flaws, or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is particularly challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these correlations since the semantics of the code remain correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate code assistants into producing incorrect outputs, including vulnerabilities or backdoors, while shifting the blame to the victim developer or tester. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving an 83.09% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by many popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, existing defenses, including adversarial fine-tuning, are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.

### Constraints on the early Universe star formation efficiency from galaxy   clustering and halo modeling of H$α$ and [O III] emitters
**Authors**: Marko Shuntov, Pascal A. Oesch, Sune Toft, Romain A. Meyer, Alba Covelo-Paz, Louise Paquereau, Rychard Bouwens, Gabriel Brammer, Viola Gelli, Emma Giovinazzo, Thomas Herard-Demanche, Garth D. Illingworth, Charlotte Mason, Rohan P. Naidu, Andrea Weibel, Mengyuan Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:19:30Z

**Summary**: We develop a theoretical framework to provide observational constraints on the early Universe galaxy-halo connection by combining measurements of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) and galaxy clustering via the 2-point correlation function (2PCF). We implemented this framework in the FRESCO and CONGRESS JWST NIRCam/grism surveys by measuring the 2PCF of spectroscopically selected samples of H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters at $3.8<z<9$ in 124 arcmin$^2$ in GOODS-N and GOODS-S. By fitting the 2PCF and UVLF at $3.8<z<9$ we inferred that the H$\alpha$ and [OIII] samples at $\langle z \rangle \sim4.3, 5.4$ and $7.3$ reside in halos of masses of log$(M_{\rm h}/$M$_{\odot}) = 11.5$, $11.2$, $11.0$ respectively, while their galaxy bias increases with redshift with values of $b_{\rm g} = 4.0$, $5.0$, $7.6$. These halos do not represent extreme overdense environments at these epochs. We constrain the instantaneous star formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the ratio of the star formation rate over the baryonic accretion rate as a function of halo mass. The SFE rises with halo mass, peaks at $\sim20\%$ at $M_{\rm h} \sim 3 \times 10^{11}\, M_{\odot}$, and declines at higher halo masses. The SFE-$M_{\rm h}$ shows only a mild evolution with redshift with tentative indications that low mass halos decrease but the high mass halos increase in efficiency with redshift. The scatter in the $M_{\rm UV}-M_{\rm h}$ relation, quantified by $\sigma_{\rm UV}$, implies stochasticity in the UV luminosities of $\sim 0.7$ mag, relatively constant with z. Extrapolating our model to $z>9$ shows that a constant SFE-$M_{\rm h}$ fixed at $z=8$ cannot reproduce the observed UVLF and neither high maximum SFE nor high stochasticity alone can explain the high abundances of luminous galaxies seen by JWST. Extending the analysis of the UVLF and 2PCF to $z>9$ measured from wider surveys will be crucial in breaking degeneracies.

### Modeling Future Conversation Turns to Teach LLMs to Ask Clarifying   Questions
**Authors**: Michael J. Q. Zhang, W. Bradley Knox, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:17:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) must often respond to highly ambiguous user requests. In such cases, the LLM's best response may be to ask a clarifying question to elicit more information. Existing LLMs often respond by presupposing a single interpretation of such ambiguous requests, frustrating users who intended a different interpretation. We speculate this is caused by current preference data labeling practice, where LLM responses are evaluated only on their prior contexts. To address this, we assign preference labels by simulating their expected outcomes in future turns. This allows LLMs to learn to ask clarifying questions when it can generate responses that are tailored to each user interpretation in future turns. On open-domain QA datasets with multiple annotations, we evaluate systems based on their ability to ask clarifying questions to recover each user's interpretation and expected answer. We compare systems trained using our proposed preference labeling methods against standard methods, which assign preferences based on only prior context. Our method achieves a 5% improvement in F1 measured against the answer set from different interpretations of each query, showing the value of modeling future conversation turns. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to train models to judiciously determine when to ask clarifying questions, directly answering the question when clarification is unnecessary. In our experiments, we find that our method achieves a 3% improvement in accuracy of such judgments over existing methods.

### DARS: Dynamic Action Re-Sampling to Enhance Coding Agent Performance by   Adaptive Tree Traversal
**Authors**: Vaibhav Aggarwal, Ojasv Kamal, Abhinav Japesh, Zhijing Jin, Bernhard Schölkopf

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:02:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing, data analysis, and software development, by enabling automation. In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.

### VSTAR: Generative Temporal Nursing for Longer Dynamic Video Synthesis
**Authors**: Yumeng Li, William Beluch, Margret Keuper, Dan Zhang, Anna Khoreva

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:55:22Z

**Summary**: Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis, open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients: 1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.

### Conversational Agents as Catalysts for Critical Thinking: Challenging   Social Influence in Group Decision-making
**Authors**: Soohwan Lee, Seoyeong Hwang, Dajung Kim, Kyungho Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:54:12Z

**Summary**: Group decision-making processes frequently suffer when social influence and power dynamics suppress minority viewpoints, leading to compliance and groupthink. Conversational agents can counteract these harmful dynamics by encouraging critical thinking. This study investigates how LLM-powered devil's advocate systems affect psychological safety, opinion expression, and satisfaction in power-imbalanced group dynamics. We conducted an experiment with 48 participants in 12 four-person groups, each containing three high-power (senior) and one low-power (junior) member. Each group completed decision tasks in both baseline and AI intervention conditions. Results show AI counterarguments fostered a more flexible atmosphere and significantly enhanced both process and outcome satisfaction for all participants, with particularly notable improvements for minority members. Cognitive workload increased slightly, though not significantly. This research contributes empirical evidence on how AI systems can effectively navigate power hierarchies to foster more inclusive decision-making environments, highlighting the importance of balancing intervention frequency, maintaining conversational flow, and preserving group cohesion.

### JuDGE: Benchmarking Judgment Document Generation for Chinese Legal   System
**Authors**: Weihang Su, Baoqing Yue, Qingyao Ai, Yiran Hu, Jiaqi Li, Changyue Wang, Kaiyuan Zhang, Yueyue Wu, Yiqun Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:48:18Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces JuDGE (Judgment Document Generation Evaluation), a novel benchmark for evaluating the performance of judgment document generation in the Chinese legal system. We define the task as generating a complete legal judgment document from the given factual description of the case. To facilitate this benchmark, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of factual descriptions from real legal cases, paired with their corresponding full judgment documents, which serve as the ground truth for evaluating the quality of generated documents. This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement. All the codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/oneal2000/JuDGE.

### Towards a Barrier-free GeoQA Portal: Natural Language Interaction with   Geospatial Data Using Multi-Agent LLMs and Semantic Search
**Authors**: Yu Feng, Puzhen Zhang, Guohui Xiao, Linfang Ding, Liqiu Meng

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:39:46Z

**Summary**: A Barrier-Free GeoQA Portal: Enhancing Geospatial Data Accessibility with a Multi-Agent LLM Framework   Geoportals are vital for accessing and analyzing geospatial data, promoting open spatial data sharing and online geo-information management. Designed with GIS-like interaction and layered visualization, they often challenge non-expert users with complex functionalities and overlapping layers that obscure spatial relationships. We propose a GeoQA Portal using a multi-agent Large Language Model framework for seamless natural language interaction with geospatial data. Complex queries are broken into subtasks handled by specialized agents, retrieving relevant geographic data efficiently. Task plans are shown to users, boosting transparency. The portal supports default and custom data inputs for flexibility. Semantic search via word vector similarity aids data retrieval despite imperfect terms. Case studies, evaluations, and user tests confirm its effectiveness for non-experts, bridging GIS complexity and public access, and offering an intuitive solution for future geoportals.

### The covariance of causal effect estimators for binary v-structures
**Authors**: Jack Kuipers, Giusi Moffa

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:26:22Z

**Summary**: Previously [Journal of Causal Inference, 10, 90-105 (2022)], we computed the variance of two estimators of causal effects for a v-structure of binary variables. Here we show that a linear combination of these estimators has lower variance than either. Furthermore, we show that this holds also when the treatment variable is block randomised with a predefined number receiving treatment, with analogous results to when it is sampled randomly.

### KG-IRAG: A Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Framework for Temporal Reasoning
**Authors**: Ruiyi Yang, Hao Xue, Imran Razzak, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T04:49:29Z

**Summary**: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.

### Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems
**Authors**: Katayoun Eshkofti, Matthieu Barreau

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:59:50Z

**Summary**: In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a potential solution to the curse of dimensionality. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. This paper proposes a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.

### Decision Tree Induction Through LLMs via Semantically-Aware Evolution
**Authors**: Tennison Liu, Nicolas Huynh, Mihaela van der Schaar

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:52:03Z

**Summary**: Decision trees are a crucial class of models offering robust predictive performance and inherent interpretability across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and logistics. However, current tree induction methods often face limitations such as suboptimal solutions from greedy methods or prohibitive computational costs and limited applicability of exact optimization approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary optimization method for decision tree induction based on genetic programming (GP). Our key innovation is the integration of semantic priors and domain-specific knowledge about the search space into the optimization algorithm. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{LLEGO}$, a framework that incorporates semantic priors into genetic search operators through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby enhancing search efficiency and targeting regions of the search space that yield decision trees with superior generalization performance. This is operationalized through novel genetic operators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively utilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to exploit high-performing regions, and $\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for efficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are controlled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance between exploration and exploitation across the search space. Empirically, we demonstrate across various benchmarks that $\texttt{LLEGO}$ evolves superior-performing trees compared to existing tree induction methods, and exhibits significantly more efficient search performance compared to conventional GP approaches.

### Emerging Synergies in Causality and Deep Generative Models: A Survey
**Authors**: Guanglin Zhou, Shaoan Xie, Guang-Yuan Hao, Shiming Chen, Biwei Huang, Xiwei Xu, Chen Wang, Liming Zhu, Lina Yao, Kun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:39:18Z

**Summary**: In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest to understand and model data-generating processes (DGPs) is of paramount importance. Deep generative models (DGMs) have proven adept in capturing complex data distributions but often fall short in generalization and interpretability. On the other hand, causality offers a structured lens to comprehend the mechanisms driving data generation and highlights the causal-effect dynamics inherent in these processes. While causality excels in interpretability and the ability to extrapolate, it grapples with intricacies of high-dimensional spaces. Recognizing the synergistic potential, we delve into the confluence of causality and DGMs. We elucidate the integration of causal principles within DGMs, investigate causal identification using DGMs, and navigate an emerging research frontier of causality in large-scale generative models, particularly generative large language models (LLMs). We offer insights into methodologies, highlight open challenges, and suggest future directions, positioning our comprehensive review as an essential guide in this swiftly emerging and evolving area.

### Why Personalizing Deep Learning-Based Code Completion Tools Matters
**Authors**: Alessandro Giagnorio, Alberto Martin-Lopez, Gabriele Bavota

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:26:06Z

**Summary**: Deep learning (DL)-based code completion tools have transformed software development by enabling advanced code generation. These tools leverage models trained on vast amounts of code from numerous repositories, capturing general coding patterns. However, the impact of fine-tuning these models for specific organizations or developers to boost their performance on such subjects remains unexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by presenting solid empirical evidence answering this question. More specifically, we consider 136 developers from two organizations (Apache and Spring), two model architectures (T5 and Code Llama), and three model sizes (60M, 750M, and 7B trainable parameters). T5 models (60M, 750M) were pre-trained and fine-tuned on over 2,000 open-source projects, excluding the subject organizations' data, and compared against versions fine-tuned on organization- and developer-specific datasets. For the Code Llama model (7B), we compared the performance of the already pre-trained model publicly available online with the same model fine-tuned via parameter-efficient fine-tuning on organization- and developer-specific datasets. Our results show that there is a boost in prediction capabilities provided by both an organization-specific and a developer-specific additional fine-tuning, with the former being particularly performant. Such a finding generalizes across (i) the two subject organizations (i.e., Apache and Spring) and (ii) models of completely different magnitude (from 60M to 7B trainable parameters). Finally, we show that DL models fine-tuned on an organization-specific dataset achieve the same completion performance of pre-trained code models used out of the box and being $\sim$10$\times$ larger, with consequent savings in terms of deployment and inference cost (e.g., smaller GPUs needed).

### Out-of-equlibrium inference of feeding rates through population data   from generic consumer-resource stochastic dynamics
**Authors**: Jose A. Capitan, David Alonso

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:25:36Z

**Summary**: Statistical models are often structurally unidentifiable, because different sets of parameters can lead to equal model outcomes. To be useful for prediction and parameter inference from data, stochastic population models need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be uniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In particular, precise estimation of feeding rates in consumer-resource dynamics is crucial, because consumer-resource processes are central in determining biomass transport across ecosystems. Model parameters are usually estimated at stationarity, because in that case model analyses are often easier. In this contribution we analyze the problem of parameter redundancy in a multi-resource consumer-resource model, showing that model indentifiability depends on whether the dynamics have reached stationarity or not. To be precise, we: (i) Calculate the steady-state and out-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator's abundances analytically using generating functions, which allow us to unveil parameter redundancy and carry out proper maximum likelihood estimation. (ii) Conduct \emph{in silico} experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that are either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum likelihood parameter estimation. (iii) Show that, when model observations are recorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas if sampling is done solely at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from data (i.e., parameters are redundant). We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of general dynamical models.

### Current Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using   Scanning NV-Magnetometry
**Authors**: Conor J. McCluskey, James Dalzell, Amit Kumar, J. Marty Gregg

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:23:39Z

**Summary**: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.

### Streamlining Prediction in Bayesian Deep Learning
**Authors**: Rui Li, Marcus Klasson, Arno Solin, Martin Trapp

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:18:04Z

**Summary**: The rising interest in Bayesian deep learning (BDL) has led to a plethora of methods for estimating the posterior distribution. However, efficient computation of inferences, such as predictions, has been largely overlooked with Monte Carlo integration remaining the standard. In this work we examine streamlining prediction in BDL through a single forward pass without sampling. For this we use local linearisation on activation functions and local Gaussian approximations at linear layers. Thus allowing us to analytically compute an approximation to the posterior predictive distribution. We showcase our approach for both MLP and transformers, such as ViT and GPT-2, and assess its performance on regression and classification tasks.

### Implicit Reasoning in Transformers is Reasoning through Shortcuts
**Authors**: Tianhe Lin, Jian Xie, Siyu Yuan, Deqing Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:08:17Z

**Summary**: Test-time compute is emerging as a new paradigm for enhancing language models' complex multi-step reasoning capabilities, as demonstrated by the success of OpenAI's o1 and o3, as well as DeepSeek's R1. Compared to explicit reasoning in test-time compute, implicit reasoning is more inference-efficient, requiring fewer generated tokens. However, why does the advanced reasoning capability fail to emerge in the implicit reasoning style? In this work, we train GPT-2 from scratch on a curated multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset and conduct analytical experiments to investigate how language models perform implicit reasoning in multi-step tasks. Our findings reveal: 1) Language models can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests via implicit reasoning. However, this capability only emerges when trained on fixed-pattern data. 2) Conversely, implicit reasoning abilities emerging from training on unfixed-pattern data tend to overfit a specific pattern and fail to generalize further. Notably, this limitation is also observed in state-of-the-art large language models. These findings suggest that language models acquire implicit reasoning through shortcut learning, enabling strong performance on tasks with similar patterns while lacking generalization.

### Inferring Event Descriptions from Time Series with Language Models
**Authors**: Mingtian Tan, Mike A. Merrill, Zack Gottesman, Tim Althoff, David Evans, Tom Hartvigsen

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:07:33Z

**Summary**: Time series data measure how environments change over time and drive decision-making in critical domains like finance and healthcare. When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation for Topic Modeling in Organizational   Research: An Introduction with Empirical Demonstration
**Authors**: Gerion Spielberger, Florian M. Artinger, Jochen Reb, Rudolf Kerschreiter

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:00:26Z

**Summary**: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.

### Breaking Boundaries: Investigating the Effects of Model Editing on   Cross-linguistic Performance
**Authors**: Somnath Banerjee, Avik Halder, Rajarshi Mandal, Sayan Layek, Ian Soboroff, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:58:48Z

**Summary**: The integration of pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT has revolutionized NLP, particularly for English, but it has also created linguistic imbalances. This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.

### Can LLMs Enable Verification in Mainstream Programming?
**Authors**: Aleksandr Shefer, Igor Engel, Stanislav Alekseev, Daniil Berezun, Ekaterina Verbitskaia, Anton Podkopaev

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:58:00Z

**Summary**: Although formal methods are capable of producing reliable software, they have seen minimal adoption in everyday programming. Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.

**Authors**: Koji Inoue, Mikey Elmers, Divesh Lala, Tatsuya Kawahara

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:50:37Z

**Summary**: Laughter serves as a multifaceted communicative signal in human interaction, yet its identification within dialogue presents a significant challenge for conversational AI systems. This study addresses this challenge by annotating laughable contexts in Japanese spontaneous text conversation data and developing a taxonomy to classify the underlying reasons for such contexts. Initially, multiple annotators manually labeled laughable contexts using a binary decision (laughable or non-laughable). Subsequently, an LLM was used to generate explanations for the binary annotations of laughable contexts, which were then categorized into a taxonomy comprising ten categories, including "Empathy and Affinity" and "Humor and Surprise," highlighting the diverse range of laughter-inducing scenarios. The study also evaluated GPT-4o's performance in recognizing the majority labels of laughable contexts, achieving an F1 score of 43.14%. These findings contribute to the advancement of conversational AI by establishing a foundation for more nuanced recognition and generation of laughter, ultimately fostering more natural and engaging human-AI interactions.

### Lost in Time: Clock and Calendar Understanding Challenges in Multimodal   LLMs
**Authors**: Rohit Saxena, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:43:52Z

**Summary**: Understanding time from visual representations is a fundamental cognitive skill, yet it remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.

### Synthetic Clarification and Correction Dialogues about Data-Centric   Tasks -- A Teacher-Student Approach
**Authors**: Christian Poelitz, Nick McKenna

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:37:25Z

**Summary**: Real dialogues with AI assistants for solving data-centric tasks often follow dynamic, unpredictable paths due to imperfect information provided by the user or in the data, which must be caught and handled. Developing datasets which capture such user-AI interactions is difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we develop a novel framework for synthetically generating controlled, multi-turn conversations between a user and AI assistant for the task of table-based question answering, which can be generated from an existing dataset with fully specified table QA examples for any target domain. Each conversation aims to solve a table-based reasoning question through collaborative effort, modeling one of two real-world scenarios: (1) an AI-initiated clarification, or (2) a user-initiated correction. Critically, we employ a strong teacher LLM to verify the correctness of our synthetic conversations, ensuring high quality. We demonstrate synthetic datasets generated from TAT-QA and WikiTableQuestions as benchmarks of frontier LLMs. We find that even larger models struggle to effectively issuing clarification questions and accurately integrate user feedback for corrections.

### Speculative Decoding for Verilog: Speed and Quality, All in One
**Authors**: Changran Xu, Yi Liu, Yunhao Zhou, Shan Huang, Ningyi Xu, Qiang Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:21:53Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized code generation tasks across various programming languages. However, the unique characteristics of programming languages, particularly those like Verilog with specific syntax and lower representation in training datasets, pose significant challenges for conventional tokenization and decoding approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of speculative decoding for Verilog code generation, showing that it can improve both inference speed and output quality, effectively achieving speed and quality all in one. Unlike standard LLM tokenization schemes, which often fragment meaningful code structures, our approach aligns decoding stops with syntactically significant tokens, making it easier for models to learn the token distribution. This refinement addresses inherent tokenization issues and enhances the model's ability to capture Verilog's logical constructs more effectively. Our experimental results show that our method achieves up to a 5.05x speedup in Verilog code generation and increases pass@10 functional accuracy on RTLLM by up to 17.19% compared to conventional training strategies. These findings highlight speculative decoding as a promising approach to bridge the quality gap in code generation for specialized programming languages.

### Marten: Visual Question Answering with Mask Generation for Multi-modal   Document Understanding
**Authors**: Zining Wang, Tongkun Guan, Pei Fu, Chen Duan, Qianyi Jiang, Zhentao Guo, Shan Guo, Junfeng Luo, Wei Shen, Xiaokang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:07:14Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a novel dimension to document understanding, i.e., they endow large language models with visual comprehension capabilities; however, how to design a suitable image-text pre-training task for bridging the visual and language modality in document-level MLLMs remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel visual-language alignment method that casts the key issue as a Visual Question Answering with Mask generation (VQAMask) task, optimizing two tasks simultaneously: VQA-based text parsing and mask generation. The former allows the model to implicitly align images and text at the semantic level. The latter introduces an additional mask generator (discarded during inference) to explicitly ensure alignment between visual texts within images and their corresponding image regions at a spatially-aware level. Together, they can prevent model hallucinations when parsing visual text and effectively promote spatially-aware feature representation learning. To support the proposed VQAMask task, we construct a comprehensive image-mask generation pipeline and provide a large-scale dataset with 6M data (MTMask6M). Subsequently, we demonstrate that introducing the proposed mask generation task yields competitive document-level understanding performance. Leveraging the proposed VQAMask, we introduce Marten, a training-efficient MLLM tailored for document-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our Marten consistently achieves significant improvements among 8B-MLLMs in document-centric tasks. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/PriNing/Marten.

### Words Matter: Leveraging Individual Text Embeddings for Code Generation   in CLIP Test-Time Adaptation
**Authors**: Shambhavi Mishra, Julio Silva-Rodrıguez, Ismail Ben Ayed, Marco Pedersoli, Jose Dolz

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:02:05Z

**Summary**: Vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have shown unprecedented zero-shot performance across a wide range of tasks. Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we explore how to efficiently leverage class text information to mitigate these distribution drifts encountered by large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time inference. In particular, we propose to generate pseudo-labels for the test-time samples by exploiting generic class text embeddings as fixed centroids of a label assignment problem, which is efficiently solved with Optimal Transport. Furthermore, the proposed adaptation method (CLIP-OT) integrates a multiple template knowledge distillation approach, which replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning but without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of CLIP-OT, achieving performance gains of up to 7% over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally and memory efficient.

### Spinor ice correlation in flat-band electronic states on kagome and   pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling
**Authors**: Hiroki Nakai, Masafumi Udagawa, Chisa Hotta

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:53:57Z

**Summary**: We investigate the emergence and transformation of pinch-point singularities in the excitation spectrum of electronic flat band systems on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interactions. While pinch points are widely recognized as signatures of classical spin liquids, they also appear in electronic flat-band systems when there exists a singular band-touching point to dispersive bands. We explore how SOC modifies the pinch-point structure in the chiral spin flat-band metallic state, which we term spinor-ice. The pinch point profile can rotate or redistribute its spectral weight, governed by a prefactor in the spectral function that primarily depends on the direction of the ground-state spin polarization, where we show that SOC flat bands could be experimentally probed by rotating the spin polarization of the injected electron to infer internal magnetic structures. These observations are discussed in conjunction with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the application to the potential SOC flat-band material $\rm CsW_2O_6$. We also demonstrate the persistent residual pinch-point features under Coulomb interactions and deviations from the ideal flat-band limit.

### Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Seungeun Oh, Jinhyuk Kim, Jihong Park, Seung-Woo Ko, Tony Q. S. Quek, Seong-Lyun Kim

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:50:58Z

**Summary**: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.

### Inference-Time Intervention in Large Language Models for Reliable   Requirement Verification
**Authors**: Paul Darm, James Xie, Annalisa Riccardi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:49:36Z

**Summary**: Steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenge, particularly in engineering applications where precision and reliability are critical. While fine-tuning and prompting methods can modify model behavior, they lack the dynamic and exact control necessary for engineering applications. Inference-time intervention techniques provide a promising alternative, allowing targeted adjustments to LLM outputs. In this work, we demonstrate how interventions enable fine-grained control for automating the usually time-intensive requirement verification process in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Using two early-stage Capella SysML models of space missions with associated requirements, we apply the intervened LLMs to reason over a graph representation of the model to determine whether a requirement is fulfilled. Our method achieves robust and reliable outputs, significantly improving over both a baseline model and a fine-tuning approach. By identifying and modifying as few as one to three specialised attention heads, we can significantly change the model's behavior. When combined with self-consistency, this allows us to achieve perfect precision on our holdout test set.

### Can I introduce my boyfriend to my grandmother? Evaluating Large   Language Models Capabilities on Iranian Social Norm Classification
**Authors**: Hamidreza Saffari, Mohammadamin Shafiei, Donya Rooein, Francesco Pierri, Debora Nozza

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:28:01Z

**Summary**: Creating globally inclusive AI systems demands datasets reflecting diverse social norms. Iran, with its unique cultural blend, offers an ideal case study, with Farsi adding linguistic complexity. In this work, we introduce the Iranian Social Norms (ISN) dataset, a novel collection of 1,699 Iranian social norms, including environments, demographic features, and scope annotation, alongside English translations. Our evaluation of 6 Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying Iranian social norms, using a variety of prompts, uncovered critical insights into the impact of geographic and linguistic context. Results revealed a substantial performance gap in LLMs' comprehension of Iranian norms. Notably, while the geographic context in English prompts enhanced the performance, this effect was absent in Farsi, pointing to nuanced linguistic challenges. Particularly, performance was significantly worse for Iran-specific norms, emphasizing the importance of culturally tailored datasets. As the first Farsi dataset for social norm classification, ISN will facilitate crucial cross-cultural analyses, shedding light on how values differ across contexts and cultures.

### RNA-FrameFlow: Flow Matching for de novo 3D RNA Backbone Design
**Authors**: Rishabh Anand, Chaitanya K. Joshi, Alex Morehead, Arian R. Jamasb, Charles Harris, Simon V. Mathis, Kieran Didi, Rex Ying, Bryan Hooi, Pietro Liò

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:25:10Z

**Summary**: We introduce RNA-FrameFlow, the first generative model for 3D RNA backbone design. We build upon SE(3) flow matching for protein backbone generation and establish protocols for data preparation and evaluation to address unique challenges posed by RNA modeling. We formulate RNA structures as a set of rigid-body frames and associated loss functions which account for larger, more conformationally flexible RNA backbones (13 atoms per nucleotide) vs. proteins (4 atoms per residue). Toward tackling the lack of diversity in 3D RNA datasets, we explore training with structural clustering and cropping augmentations. Additionally, we define a suite of evaluation metrics to measure whether the generated RNA structures are globally self-consistent (via inverse folding followed by forward folding) and locally recover RNA-specific structural descriptors. The most performant version of RNA-FrameFlow generates locally realistic RNA backbones of 40-150 nucleotides, over 40% of which pass our validity criteria as measured by a self-consistency TM-score >= 0.45, at which two RNAs have the same global fold.

### DangerMaps: Personalized Safety Advice for Travel in Urban Environments   using a Retrieval-Augmented Language Model
**Authors**: Jonas Oppenlaender

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:18:07Z

**Summary**: Planning a trip into a potentially unsafe area is a difficult task. We conducted a formative study on travelers' information needs, finding that most of them turn to search engines for trip planning. Search engines, however, fail to provide easily interpretable results adapted to the context and personal information needs of a traveler. Large language models (LLMs) create new possibilities for providing personalized travel safety advice. To explore this idea, we developed DangerMaps, a mapping system that assists its users in researching the safety of an urban travel destination, whether it is pre-travel or on-location. DangerMaps plots safety ratings onto a map and provides explanations on demand. This late breaking work specifically emphasizes the challenges of designing real-world applications with large language models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to prompt design and highlight future areas of research.

### SCJD: Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation for Efficient 3D Human   Pose Estimation
**Authors**: Weihong Chen, Xuemiao Xu, Haoxin Yang, Yi Xie, Peng Xiao, Cheng Xu, Huaidong Zhang, Pheng-Ann Heng

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:14:49Z

**Summary**: Existing 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) methods achieve high accuracy but suffer from computational overhead and slow inference, while knowledge distillation methods fail to address spatial relationships between joints and temporal correlations in multi-frame inputs. In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCJD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/wileychan/SCJD.

### GenPara: Enhancing the 3D Design Editing Process by Inferring Users'   Regions of Interest with Text-Conditional Shape Parameters
**Authors**: Jiin Choi, Seung Won Lee, Kyung Hoon Hyun

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:12:29Z

**Summary**: In 3D design, specifying design objectives and visualizing complex shapes through text alone proves to be a significant challenge. Although advancements in 3D GenAI have significantly enhanced part assembly and the creation of high-quality 3D designs, many systems still to dynamically generate and edit design elements based on the shape parameters. To bridge this gap, we propose GenPara, an interactive 3D design editing system that leverages text-conditional shape parameters of part-aware 3D designs and visualizes design space within the Exploration Map and Design Versioning Tree. Additionally, among the various shape parameters generated by LLM, the system extracts and provides design outcomes within the user's regions of interest based on Bayesian inference. A user study N = 16 revealed that \textit{GenPara} enhanced the comprehension and management of designers with text-conditional shape parameters, streamlining design exploration and concretization. This improvement boosted efficiency and creativity of the 3D design process.

### UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation
**Authors**: Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Lingqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:07:07Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.

### The Erdős-Rényi Random Graph Conditioned on Every Component Being   a Clique
**Authors**: Martijn Gösgens, Lukas Lüchtrath, Elena Magnanini, Marc Noy, Élie de Panafieu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:02:28Z

**Summary**: Motivated by an application in community detection, we consider an \ER random graph conditioned on the rare event that all connected components are fully connected. Such graphs can be considered as partitions of vertices into cliques. Hence, this conditional distribution defines a distribution over partitions. We show that a popular community detection method is equivalent to Bayesian inference with this distribution as prior over the community partitions. Using tools from analytic combinatorics, we prove limit theorems for several graph observables in this conditional distribution: the number of cliques; the number of edges; and the degree distribution. We consider several regimes of the connection probability $p$ as the number of vertices $n$ diverges. For $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$, the conditioning yields the uniform distribution over set partitions, which is well-studied, but has not been studied as a graph distribution before. For $p<\tfrac{1}{2}$, we show that the number of cliques is of the order $n/\sqrt{\log n}$, while for $p>\tfrac{1}{2}$, we prove that the graph consists of a single clique with high probability. This shows that there is a phase transition at $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$. We additionally study the near-critical regime $p_n\downarrow\tfrac{1}{2}$, as well as the sparse regime $p_n\downarrow0$. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for community detection.

### Testing Uniform Random Samplers: Methods, Datasets and Protocols
**Authors**: Olivier Zeyen, Maxime Cordy, Martin Gubri, Gilles Perrouin, Mathieu Acher

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:00:36Z

**Summary**: Boolean formulae compactly encode huge, constrained search spaces. Thus, variability-intensive systems are often encoded with Boolean formulae. The search space of a variability-intensive system is usually too large to explore without statistical inference (e.g. testing). Testing every valid configuration is computationally expensive (if not impossible) for most systems. This leads most testing approaches to sample a few configurations before analyzing them. A desirable property of such samples is uniformity: Each solution should have the same selection probability. Uniformity is the property that facilitates statistical inference. This property motivated the design of uniform random samplers, relying on SAT solvers and counters and achieving different trade-offs between uniformity and scalability. Though we can observe their performance in practice, judging the quality of the generated samples is different. Assessing the uniformity of a sampler is similar in nature to assessing the uniformity of a pseudo-random number (PRNG) generator. However, sampling is much slower and the nature of sampling also implies that the hyperspace containing the samples is constrained. This means that testing PRNGs is subject to fewer constraints than testing samplers. We propose a framework that contains five statistical tests which are suited to test uniform random samplers. Moreover, we demonstrate their use by testing seven samplers. Finally, we demonstrate the influence of the Boolean formula given as input to the samplers under test on the test results.

### Fast Autoregressive Video Generation with Diagonal Decoding
**Authors**: Yang Ye, Junliang Guo, Haoyu Wu, Tianyu He, Tim Pearce, Tabish Rashid, Katja Hofmann, Jiang Bian

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:42:55Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in video generation, but their sequential token-by-token decoding process poses a major bottleneck, particularly for long videos represented by tens of thousands of tokens. In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free inference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that exploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates tokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling parallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across consecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various generative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the trade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a cost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the model with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on small-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation models and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\times$ speedup compared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual fidelity.

### Tuning LLM Judge Design Decisions for 1/1000 of the Cost
**Authors**: David Salinas, Omar Swelam, Frank Hutter

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:09:29Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.

### Learning on LLM Output Signatures for gray-box LLM Behavior Analysis
**Authors**: Guy Bar-Shalom, Fabrizio Frasca, Derek Lim, Yoav Gelberg, Yftah Ziser, Ran El-Yaniv, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:04:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption, yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited, particularly in detecting data contamination and hallucinations. While recently proposed probing techniques provide insights through activation analysis, they require "white-box" access to model internals, often unavailable. Current "gray-box" approaches typically analyze only the probability of the actual tokens in the sequence with simple task-specific heuristics. Importantly, these methods overlook the rich information contained in the full token distribution at each processing step. To address these limitations, we propose that gray-box analysis should leverage the complete observable output of LLMs, consisting of both the previously used token probabilities as well as the complete token distribution sequences - a unified data type we term LOS (LLM Output Signature). To this end, we develop a transformer-based approach to process LOS that theoretically guarantees approximation of existing techniques while enabling more nuanced analysis. Our approach achieves superior performance on hallucination and data contamination detection in gray-box settings, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong transfer capabilities across datasets and LLMs, suggesting that LOS captures fundamental patterns in LLM behavior. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BarSGuy/LLM-Output-Signatures-Network.

### PaCoST: Paired Confidence Significance Testing for Benchmark   Contamination Detection in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Huixuan Zhang, Yun Lin, Xiaojun Wan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:57:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be trained on vast amounts of data, which may unintentionally or intentionally include data from commonly used benchmarks. This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications. To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow. Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs. Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks. We find that almost all models and benchmarks we tested are suspected contaminated more or less. We finally call for new LLM evaluation methods.

 ### MusicInfuser: Making Video Diffusion Listen and Dance
**Authors**: Susung Hong, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Brian Curless, Steven M. Seitz

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to a specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models. We introduce an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs to assess multiple dimensions of dance generation quality. The project page and code are available at https://susunghong.github.io/MusicInfuser.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can handle a wide variety of general tasks with simple prompts, without the need for task-specific training. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms. This work seeks to help researchers organize current advancements in the field and inspire better alignment methods.

**Authors**: Jiacheng Guo, Yue Wu, Jiahao Qiu, Kaixuan Huang, Xinzhe Juan, Ling Yang, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:58:28Z

**Summary**: Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning. We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jcguo123/Temporal-Consistency

### Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction   of Programs
**Authors**: Shraddha Surana, Ashwin Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:57:16Z

**Summary**: We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.

### Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration
**Authors**: Fardin Saad, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Munindar P. Singh

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:54:14Z

**Summary**: Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.

### Sparse Autoencoders for Hypothesis Generation
**Authors**: Rajiv Movva, Kenny Peng, Nikhil Garg, Jon Kleinberg, Emma Pierson

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:51:56Z

**Summary**: We describe HypotheSAEs, a general method to hypothesize interpretable relationships between text data (e.g., headlines) and a target variable (e.g., clicks). HypotheSAEs has three steps: (1) train a sparse autoencoder on text embeddings to produce interpretable features describing the data distribution, (2) select features that predict the target variable, and (3) generate a natural language interpretation of each feature (e.g., "mentions being surprised or shocked") using an LLM. Each interpretation serves as a hypothesis about what predicts the target variable. Compared to baselines, our method better identifies reference hypotheses on synthetic datasets (at least +0.06 in F1) and produces more predictive hypotheses on real datasets (~twice as many significant findings), despite requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less compute than recent LLM-based methods. HypotheSAEs also produces novel discoveries on two well-studied tasks: explaining partisan differences in Congressional speeches and identifying drivers of engagement with online headlines.

### Creation-MMBench: Assessing Context-Aware Creative Intelligence in MLLM
**Authors**: Xinyu Fang, Zhijian Chen, Kai Lan, Shengyuan Ding, Yingji Liang, Xiangyu Zhao, Farong Wen, Zicheng Zhang, Guofeng Zhang, Haodong Duan, Kai Chen, Dahua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:51:34Z

**Summary**: Creativity is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, involving the ability to generate novel and appropriate solutions across diverse contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence. Full data and evaluation code is released on https://github.com/open-compass/Creation-MMBench.

### Calibrating Verbal Uncertainty as a Linear Feature to Reduce   Hallucinations
**Authors**: Ziwei Ji, Lei Yu, Yeskendir Koishekenov, Yejin Bang, Anthony Hartshorn, Alan Schelten, Cheng Zhang, Pascale Fung, Nicola Cancedda

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:51:04Z

**Summary**: LLMs often adopt an assertive language style also when making false claims. Such ``overconfident hallucinations'' mislead users and erode trust. Achieving the ability to express in language the actual degree of uncertainty around a claim is therefore of great importance. We find that ``verbal uncertainty'' is governed by a single linear feature in the representation space of LLMs, and show that this has only moderate correlation with the actual ``semantic uncertainty'' of the model. We apply this insight and show that (1) the mismatch between semantic and verbal uncertainty is a better predictor of hallucinations than semantic uncertainty alone and (2) we can intervene on verbal uncertainty at inference time and reduce hallucinations on short-form answers, achieving an average relative reduction of 32%.

### LLMs as Models for Analogical Reasoning
**Authors**: Sam Musker, Alex Duchnowski, Raphaël Millière, Ellie Pavlick

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:49:06Z

**Summary**: Analogical reasoning-the capacity to identify and map structural relationships between different domains-is fundamental to human cognition and learning. Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can sometimes match humans in analogical reasoning tasks, opening the possibility that analogical reasoning might emerge from domain general processes. However, it is still debated whether these emergent capacities are largely superficial and limited to simple relations seen during training or whether they rather encompass the flexible representational and mapping capabilities which are the focus of leading cognitive models of analogy. In this study, we introduce novel analogical reasoning tasks that require participants to map between semantically contentful words and sequences of letters and other abstract characters. This task necessitates the ability to flexibly re-represent rich semantic information-an ability which is known to be central to human analogy but which is thus far not well-captured by existing cognitive theories and models. We assess the performance of both human participants and LLMs on tasks focusing on reasoning from semantic structure and semantic content, introducing variations that test the robustness of their analogical inferences. Advanced LLMs match human performance across several conditions, though humans and LLMs respond differently to certain task variations and semantic distractors. Our results thus provide new evidence that LLMs might offer a how-possibly explanation of human analogical reasoning in contexts that are not yet well modeled by existing theories, but that even today's best models are unlikely to yield how-actually explanations.

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:49:06Z

**Summary**: Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.

### EnvBench: A Benchmark for Automated Environment Setup
**Authors**: Aleksandra Eliseeva, Alexander Kovrigin, Ilia Kholkin, Egor Bogomolov, Yaroslav Zharov

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:19:12Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled researchers to focus on practical repository-level tasks in software engineering domain. In this work, we consider a cornerstone task for automating work with software repositories-environment setup, i.e., a task of configuring a repository-specific development environment on a system. Existing studies on environment setup introduce innovative agentic strategies, but their evaluation is often based on small datasets that may not capture the full range of configuration challenges encountered in practice. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive environment setup benchmark EnvBench. It encompasses 329 Python and 665 JVM-based (Java, Kotlin) repositories, with a focus on repositories that present genuine configuration challenges, excluding projects that can be fully configured by simple deterministic scripts. To enable further benchmark extension and usage for model tuning, we implement two automatic metrics: a static analysis check for missing imports in Python and a compilation check for JVM languages. We demonstrate the applicability of our benchmark by evaluating three environment setup approaches, including a simple zero-shot baseline and two agentic workflows, that we test with two powerful LLM backbones, GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best approach manages to successfully configure 6.69% repositories for Python and 29.47% repositories for JVM, suggesting that EnvBench remains challenging for current approaches. Our benchmark suite is publicly available at https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/EnvBench. The dataset and experiment trajectories are available at https://jb.gg/envbench.

### A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam:   MufassirQAS LLM
**Authors**: Ahmet Yusuf Alan, Enis Karaarslan, Ömer Aydin

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:14:43Z

**Summary**: Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.

### Efficient Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Dynamic Block-Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Emily Xiao, Chin-Jou Li, Yilin Zhang, Graham Neubig, Amanda Bertsch

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:13:42Z

**Summary**: Many-shot in-context learning has recently shown promise as an alternative to finetuning, with the major advantage that the same model can be served for multiple tasks. However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale.

### LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as   Evolutionary Optimizers
**Authors**: Nikhil Abhyankar, Parshin Shojaee, Chandan K. Reddy

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:11:24Z

**Summary**: Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.

### PLAY2PROMPT: Zero-shot Tool Instruction Optimization for LLM Agents via   Tool Play
**Authors**: Wei Fang, Yang Zhang, Kaizhi Qian, James Glass, Yada Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:09:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.

### Navigating LLM Ethics: Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions
**Authors**: Junfeng Jiao, Saleh Afroogh, Yiming Xu, Connor Phillips

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:57:17Z

**Summary**: This study addresses ethical issues surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) within the field of artificial intelligence. It explores the common ethical challenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and fairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It highlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and decoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from those encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to tackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance transparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information dissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM ethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical frameworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to diverse contexts. This roadmap aims to guide responsible development and integration of LLMs, envisioning a future where ethical considerations govern AI advancements in society.

### Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal   Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siwei Zhang, Yun Xiong, Yateng Tang, Xi Chen, Zian Jia, Zehao Gu, Jiarong Xu, Jiawei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:50:10Z

**Summary**: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.

**Authors**: Junfeng Jiao, Saleh Afroogh, Kevin Chen, David Atkinson, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:42:30Z

**Summary**: The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in academia has spurred a global discourse on their potential pedagogical benefits and ethical considerations. Positive reactions highlight some potential, such as collaborative creativity, increased access to education, and empowerment of trainers and trainees. However, negative reactions raise concerns about ethical complexities, balancing innovation and academic integrity, unequal access, and misinformation risks. Through a systematic survey and text-mining-based analysis of global and national directives, insights from independent research, and eighty university-level guidelines, this study provides a nuanced understanding of the opportunities and challenges posed by GAI and LLMs in education. It emphasizes the importance of balanced approaches that harness the benefits of these technologies while addressing ethical considerations and ensuring equitable access and educational outcomes. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering responsible innovation and ethical practices to guide the integration of GAI and LLMs in academia.

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:42:17Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation equips large language models with the capability to retrieve external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations by incorporating information beyond the model's intrinsic abilities. However, most prior works have focused on invoking retrieval deterministically, which makes it unsuitable for tasks such as long-form question answering. Instead, dynamically performing retrieval by invoking it only when the underlying LLM lacks the required knowledge can be more efficient. In this context, we delve deeper into the question, "To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve?" by exploring multiple uncertainty detection methods. We evaluate these methods for the task of long-form question answering, employing dynamic retrieval, and present our comparisons. Our findings suggest that uncertainty detection metrics, such as Degree Matrix Jaccard and Eccentricity, can reduce the number of retrieval calls by almost half, with only a slight reduction in question-answering accuracy.

**Authors**: Saüc Abadal Lloret, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Keerthiram Murugesan, Mrinmaya Sachan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:34:14Z

**Summary**: We present ALT (ALignment with Textual feedback), an approach that aligns language models with user preferences expressed in text. We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing constrained and unconstrained textual feedback. We also outline future directions to align models with natural language feedback.

### Safe Interval Motion Planning for Quadrotors in Dynamic Environments
**Authors**: Songhao Huang, Yuwei Wu, Yuezhan Tao, Vijay Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:27:01Z

**Summary**: Trajectory generation in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge for quadrotors, particularly due to the non-convexity in the spatial-temporal domain. Many existing methods either assume simplified static environments or struggle to produce optimal solutions in real-time. In this work, we propose an efficient safe interval motion planning framework for navigation in dynamic environments. A safe interval refers to a time window during which a specific configuration is safe. Our approach addresses trajectory generation through a two-stage process: a front-end graph search step followed by a back-end gradient-based optimization. We ensure completeness and optimality by constructing a dynamic connected visibility graph and incorporating low-order dynamic bounds within safe intervals and temporal corridors. To avoid local minima, we propose a Uniform Temporal Visibility Deformation (UTVD) for the complete evaluation of spatial-temporal topological equivalence. We represent trajectories with B-Spline curves and apply gradient-based optimization to navigate around static and moving obstacles within spatial-temporal corridors. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that our method can achieve a success rate of over 95% in environments with different density levels, exceeding the performance of other approaches, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in highly dynamic environments.

### From "Hallucination" to "Suture": Insights from Language Philosophy to   Enhance Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiantong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:27:01Z

**Summary**: This paper explores hallucination phenomena in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of language philosophy and psychoanalysis. By incorporating Lacan's concepts of the "chain of signifiers" and "suture points," we propose the Anchor-RAG framework as a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations. In contrast to the predominant reliance on trial-and-error experiments, constant adjustments of mathematical formulas, or resource-intensive methods that emphasize quantity over quality, our approach returns to the fundamental principles of linguistics to analyze the root causes of hallucinations in LLMs. Drawing from robust theoretical foundations, we derive algorithms and models that are not only effective in reducing hallucinations but also enhance LLM performance and improve output quality. This paper seeks to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding hallucinations in LLMs and aims to challenge the prevalent "guess-and-test" approach and rat race mentality in the field. We aspire to pave the way for a new era of interpretable LLMs, offering deeper insights into the inner workings of language-based AI systems.

### How much do LLMs learn from negative examples?
**Authors**: Shadi Hamdan, Deniz Yuret

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:26:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) undergo a three-phase training process: unsupervised pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and learning from human feedback (RLHF/DPO). Notably, it is during the final phase that these models are exposed to negative examples -- incorrect, rejected, or suboptimal responses to queries. This paper delves into the role of negative examples in the training of LLMs, using a likelihood-ratio (Likra) model on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks to precisely manage the influence and the volume of negative examples. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) During a critical phase in training, Likra with negative examples demonstrates a significantly larger improvement per training example compared to SFT using only positive examples. This leads to a sharp jump in the learning curve for Likra unlike the smooth and gradual improvement of SFT; (2) negative examples that are plausible but incorrect (near-misses) exert a greater influence; and (3) while training with positive examples fails to significantly decrease the likelihood of plausible but incorrect answers, training with negative examples more accurately identifies them. These results indicate a potentially significant role for negative examples in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations for LLMs.

### Good/Evil Reputation Judgment of Celebrities by LLMs via Retrieval   Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Rikuto Tsuchida, Hibiki Yokoyama, Takehito Utsuro

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:15:55Z

**Summary**: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs) can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.

### On the Standard Performance Criteria for Applied Control Design: PID,   MPC or Machine Learning Controller?
**Authors**: Pouria Sarhadi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:12:04Z

**Summary**: The traditional control theory and its application to basic and complex systems have reached an advanced level of maturity. This includes aerial, marine, and ground vehicles, as well as robotics, chemical, transportation, and electrical systems widely used in our daily lives. The emerging era of data-driven methods, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-based controllers does not indicate a weakness in well-established control theory. Instead, it aims to reduce dependence on models and uncertainties, address increasingly complex systems, and potentially achieve decision-making capabilities comparable to human-level performance. This revolution integrates knowledge from computer science, machine learning, biology, and classical control, producing promising algorithms that are yet to demonstrate widespread real-world applicability. Despite the maturity of control theory and the presence of various performance criteria, there is still a lack of standardised metrics for testing, evaluation, Verification and Validation ($V\&V$) of algorithms. This gap can lead to algorithms that, while optimal in certain aspects, may fall short of practical implementation, sparking debates within the literature. For a controller to succeed in real-world applications, it must satisfy three key categories of performance metrics: tracking quality, control effort (energy consumption), and robustness. This paper rather takes an applied perspective, proposing and consolidating standard performance criteria for testing and analysing control systems, intended for researchers and students. The proposed framework ensures the post-design applicability of a black-box algorithm, aligning with modern data analysis and $V\&V$ perspectives to prevent resource allocation to systems with limited impact or imprecise claims.

### Impossible Videos
**Authors**: Zechen Bai, Hai Ci, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:10:24Z

**Summary**: Synthetic videos nowadays is widely used to complement data scarcity and diversity of real-world videos. Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.

### Collaborative Instance Object Navigation: Leveraging   Uncertainty-Awareness to Minimize Human-Agent Dialogues
**Authors**: Francesco Taioli, Edoardo Zorzi, Gianni Franchi, Alberto Castellini, Alessandro Farinelli, Marco Cristani, Yiming Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:09:20Z

**Summary**: Language-driven instance object navigation assumes that human users initiate the task by providing a detailed description of the target instance to the embodied agent. While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes. Code and benchmark will be available upon acceptance at https://intelligolabs.github.io/CoIN/

### A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft   Landing Problem
**Authors**: Vatsal Maru

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T16:08:31Z

**Summary**: The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95% reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38% higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.

### CryptoLLM: Unleashing the Power of Prompted LLMs for SmartQnA and   Classification of Crypto Posts
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:49:08Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of social media has resulted in an large volume of user-generated content, particularly in niche domains such as cryptocurrency. This task focuses on developing robust classification models to accurately categorize cryptocurrency-related social media posts into predefined classes, including but not limited to objective, positive, negative, etc. Additionally, the task requires participants to identify the most relevant answers from a set of posts in response to specific questions. By leveraging advanced LLMs, this research aims to enhance the understanding and filtering of cryptocurrency discourse, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in this volatile sector. We have used a prompt-based technique to solve the classification task for reddit posts and twitter posts. Also, we have used 64-shot technique along with prompts on GPT-4-Turbo model to determine whether a answer is relevant to a question or not.

### QuGStep: Refining Step Size Selection in Gradient Estimation for   Variational Quantum Algorithms
**Authors**: Senwei Liang, Linghua Zhu, Xiaosong Li, Chao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:48:09Z

**Summary**: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach to solving computationally demanding problems by combining parameterized quantum circuits with classical optimization. Estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots). However, in practice, the limited shot budget introduces significant noise in the evaluation of the objective function. Gradient estimation in VQAs often relies on the finite-difference, which evaluates the noisy objective function at perturbed circuit parameter values. The accuracy of this estimation is highly dependent on the choice of step size for these perturbations. An inappropriate step size can exacerbate the impact of noise, causing inaccurate gradient estimates and hindering the classical optimization in VQAs. This paper proposes QuGStep, an algorithm that addresses the challenge of determining the appropriate step size for finite-difference gradient estimation under a shot budget. QuGStep is grounded in a theorem that proves the optimal step size, which accounts for the shot budget, minimizes the error bound in gradient estimation using finite differences. Numerical experiments approximating the ground state energy of several molecules demonstrate that QuGStep can identify the appropriate step size for the given shot budget to obtain effective gradient estimation. Notably, the step size identified by QuGStep achieved convergence to the ground state energy with over 96% fewer shots compared to using a default step size. These findings highlight the potential of QuGStep to improve the practical deployment and scalability of quantum computing technologies.

### Cancer-Answer: Empowering Cancer Care with Advanced Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:36:28Z

**Summary**: Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers account for a substantial portion of the global cancer burden, where early diagnosis is critical for improved management and patient outcomes. The complex aetiologies and overlapping symptoms across GI cancers often delay diagnosis, leading to suboptimal treatment strategies. Cancer-related queries are crucial for timely diagnosis, treatment, and patient education, as access to accurate, comprehensive information can significantly influence outcomes. However, the complexity of cancer as a disease, combined with the vast amount of available data, makes it difficult for clinicians and patients to quickly find precise answers. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses to cancer-related queries. Pre-trained with medical data, these models provide timely, actionable insights that support informed decision-making in cancer diagnosis and care, ultimately improving patient outcomes. We calculate two metrics: A1 (which represents the fraction of entities present in the model-generated answer compared to the gold standard) and A2 (which represents the linguistic correctness and meaningfulness of the model-generated answer with respect to the gold standard), achieving maximum values of 0.546 and 0.881, respectively.

### Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization
**Authors**: Carolin Schmidt, Daniele Gammelli, James Harrison, Marco Pavone, Filipe Rodrigues

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:30:08Z

**Summary**: Hierarchical policies enable strong performance in many sequential decision-making problems, such as those with high-dimensional action spaces, those requiring long-horizon planning, and settings with sparse rewards. However, learning hierarchical policies from static offline datasets presents a significant challenge. Crucially, actions taken by higher-level policies may not be directly observable within hierarchical controllers, and the offline dataset might have been generated using a different policy structure, hindering the use of standard offline learning algorithms. In this work, we propose OHIO: a framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) of hierarchical policies. Our framework leverages knowledge of the policy structure to solve the \textit{inverse problem}, recovering the unobservable high-level actions that likely generated the observed data under our hierarchical policy. This approach constructs a dataset suitable for off-the-shelf offline training. We demonstrate our framework on robotic and network optimization problems and show that it substantially outperforms end-to-end RL methods and improves robustness. We investigate a variety of instantiations of our framework, both in direct deployment of policies trained offline and when online fine-tuning is performed. Code and data are available at https://ohio-offline-hierarchical-rl.github.io

### DreamRunner: Fine-Grained Compositional Story-to-Video Generation with   Retrieval-Augmented Motion Adaptation
**Authors**: Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:19:15Z

**Summary**: Storytelling video generation (SVG) aims to produce coherent and visually rich multi-scene videos that follow a structured narrative. Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and muti-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.

### MANTRA: Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG   and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration
**Authors**: Yisen Xu, Feng Lin, Jinqiu Yang, Tse-Hsun, Chen, Nikolaos Tsantalis

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:16:51Z

**Summary**: Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.

### VGFL-SA: Vertical Graph Federated Learning Structure Attack Based on   Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Yang Chen, Bin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:07:23Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.

### InteLiPlan: An Interactive Lightweight LLM-Based Planner for Domestic   Robot Autonomy
**Authors**: Kim Tien Ly, Kai Lu, Ioannis Havoutis

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:03:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce an interactive LLM-based framework designed to enhance the autonomy and robustness of domestic robots, targeting embodied intelligence. Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR). Our method achieves a 93% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art large-scale LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.

### LLM-Match: An Open-Sourced Patient Matching Model Based on Large   Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Xiaodi Li, Shaika Chowdhury, Chung Il Wi, Maria Vassilaki, Ken Liu, Terence T Sio, Owen Garrick, Young J Juhn, James R Cerhan, Cui Tao, Nansu Zong

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:56:41Z

**Summary**: Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets - n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022 - using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.

### COPA: Comparing the Incomparable to Explore the Pareto Front
**Authors**: Adrián Javaloy, Antonio Vergari, Isabel Valera

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:51:42Z

**Summary**: In machine learning (ML), it is common to account for multiple objectives when, e.g., selecting a model to deploy. However, it is often unclear how one should compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, as they might be measured in different units or scales. For example, when deploying large language models (LLMs), we might not only care about their performance, but also their CO2 consumption. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be sensibly compared and aggregated to navigate their Pareto front. To do so, we propose to make incomparable objectives comparable via their CDFs, approximated by their relative rankings. This allows us to aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of our methodology in diverse areas such as LLM selection, domain generalization, and AutoML benchmarking, where classical ways to aggregate and normalize objectives fail.

### Near-Field Beam Prediction Using Far-Field Codebooks in Ultra-Massive   MIMO Systems
**Authors**: Ahmed Hussain, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:50:24Z

**Summary**: Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technology is a key enabler for 6G networks, offering exceptional high data rates in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) frequency bands. The deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequencies transitions wireless communication into the radiative near-field, where precise beam alignment becomes essential for accurate channel estimation. Unlike far-field systems, which rely on angular domain only, near-field necessitates beam search across both angle and distance dimensions, leading to substantially higher training overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based beam alignment to mitigate the training overhead. We highlight that the reduced path loss at shorter distances can compensate for the beamforming losses typically associated with using far-field codebooks in near-field scenarios. Additionally, far-field beamforming in the near-field exhibits angular spread, with its width determined by the user's range and angle. Leveraging this relationship, we develop a correlation interferometry (CI) algorithm, termed CI-DFT, to efficiently estimate user angle and range parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves performance close to exhaustive search in terms of achievable rate while significantly reducing the training overhead by 87.5%.

**Authors**: Ryan Quek Wei Heng, Edoardo Vittori, Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Erik Cambria, Gianmarco Mengaldo

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:37:14Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sector-level portfolio allocation through systematic analysis of macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment. Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.

### Cross-Environment Transfer Learning for Location-Aided Beam Prediction   in 5G and Beyond Millimeter-Wave Networks
**Authors**: Enrico Tosi, Panwei Hu, Aleksandar Ichkov, Marina Petrova, Ljiljana Simić

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:24:50Z

**Summary**: Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications requirebeamforming and consequent precise beam alignmentbetween the gNodeB (gNB) and the user equipment (UE) toovercome high propagation losses. This beam alignment needs tobe constantly updated for different UE locations based on beamsweepingradio frequency measurements, leading to significantbeam management overhead. One potential solution involvesusing machine learning (ML) beam prediction algorithms thatleverage UE position information to select the serving beamwithout the overhead of beam sweeping. However, the highlysite-specific nature of mm-wave propagation means that MLmodels require training from scratch for each scenario, whichis inefficient in practice. In this paper, we propose a robustcross-environment transfer learning solution for location-aidedbeam prediction, whereby the ML model trained on a referencegNB is transferred to a target gNB by fine-tuning with a limiteddataset. Extensive simulation results based on ray-tracing in twourban environments show the effectiveness of our solution forboth inter- and intra-city model transfer. Our results show thatby training the model on a reference gNB and transferring themodel by fine-tuning with only 5% of the target gNB dataset,we can achieve 80% accuracy in predicting the best beamfor the target gNB. Importantly, our approach improves thepoor generalization accuracy of transferring the model to newenvironments without fine-tuning by around 75 percentage points.This demonstrates that transfer learning enables high predictionaccuracy while reducing the computational and training datasetcollection burden of ML-based beam prediction, making itpractical for 5G-and-beyond deployments.

### Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE: Stable and efficient reinforcement   learning for LLMs
**Authors**: Nicolas Le Roux, Marc G. Bellemare, Jonathan Lebensold, Arnaud Bergeron, Joshua Greaves, Alex Fréchette, Carolyne Pelletier, Eric Thibodeau-Laufer Sándor Toth, Samantha Work

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:23:37Z

**Summary**: We propose a new algorithm for fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning. Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. We show that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the ``wasted inference'' that comes with discarding negative examples. We find that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling us to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, we find that REINFORCE's baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance.

### XOXO: Stealthy Cross-Origin Context Poisoning Attacks against AI Coding   Assistants
**Authors**: Adam Štorek, Mukur Gupta, Noopur Bhatt, Aditya Gupta, Janie Kim, Prashast Srivastava, Suman Jana

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:20:54Z

**Summary**: AI coding assistants are widely used for tasks like code generation, bug detection, and comprehension. These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code, overlooking flaws, or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is particularly challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these correlations since the semantics of the code remain correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate code assistants into producing incorrect outputs, including vulnerabilities or backdoors, while shifting the blame to the victim developer or tester. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving an 83.09% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by many popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, existing defenses, including adversarial fine-tuning, are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.

### Modeling Future Conversation Turns to Teach LLMs to Ask Clarifying   Questions
**Authors**: Michael J. Q. Zhang, W. Bradley Knox, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:17:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) must often respond to highly ambiguous user requests. In such cases, the LLM's best response may be to ask a clarifying question to elicit more information. Existing LLMs often respond by presupposing a single interpretation of such ambiguous requests, frustrating users who intended a different interpretation. We speculate this is caused by current preference data labeling practice, where LLM responses are evaluated only on their prior contexts. To address this, we assign preference labels by simulating their expected outcomes in future turns. This allows LLMs to learn to ask clarifying questions when it can generate responses that are tailored to each user interpretation in future turns. On open-domain QA datasets with multiple annotations, we evaluate systems based on their ability to ask clarifying questions to recover each user's interpretation and expected answer. We compare systems trained using our proposed preference labeling methods against standard methods, which assign preferences based on only prior context. Our method achieves a 5% improvement in F1 measured against the answer set from different interpretations of each query, showing the value of modeling future conversation turns. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to train models to judiciously determine when to ask clarifying questions, directly answering the question when clarification is unnecessary. In our experiments, we find that our method achieves a 3% improvement in accuracy of such judgments over existing methods.

### DARS: Dynamic Action Re-Sampling to Enhance Coding Agent Performance by   Adaptive Tree Traversal
**Authors**: Vaibhav Aggarwal, Ojasv Kamal, Abhinav Japesh, Zhijing Jin, Bernhard Schölkopf

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T14:02:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing, data analysis, and software development, by enabling automation. In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.

### VSTAR: Generative Temporal Nursing for Longer Dynamic Video Synthesis
**Authors**: Yumeng Li, William Beluch, Margret Keuper, Dan Zhang, Anna Khoreva

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:55:22Z

**Summary**: Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis, open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients: 1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.

### Conversational Agents as Catalysts for Critical Thinking: Challenging   Social Influence in Group Decision-making
**Authors**: Soohwan Lee, Seoyeong Hwang, Dajung Kim, Kyungho Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:54:12Z

**Summary**: Group decision-making processes frequently suffer when social influence and power dynamics suppress minority viewpoints, leading to compliance and groupthink. Conversational agents can counteract these harmful dynamics by encouraging critical thinking. This study investigates how LLM-powered devil's advocate systems affect psychological safety, opinion expression, and satisfaction in power-imbalanced group dynamics. We conducted an experiment with 48 participants in 12 four-person groups, each containing three high-power (senior) and one low-power (junior) member. Each group completed decision tasks in both baseline and AI intervention conditions. Results show AI counterarguments fostered a more flexible atmosphere and significantly enhanced both process and outcome satisfaction for all participants, with particularly notable improvements for minority members. Cognitive workload increased slightly, though not significantly. This research contributes empirical evidence on how AI systems can effectively navigate power hierarchies to foster more inclusive decision-making environments, highlighting the importance of balancing intervention frequency, maintaining conversational flow, and preserving group cohesion.

**Authors**: Arindam Saha, Baramee Charoensombutamon, Thibault Michel, V. Vijendran, Lachlan Walker, Akira Furusawa, Syed M. Assad, Ben C. Buchler, Ping Koy Lam, Aaron D. Tranter

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:50:44Z

**Summary**: As free-space optical systems grow in scale and complexity, troubleshooting becomes increasingly time-consuming and, in the case of remote installations, perhaps impractical. An example of a task that is often laborious is the alignment of a high-finesse optical resonator, which is highly sensitive to the mode of the input beam. In this work, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to achieve autonomous mode-matching of a free-space optical resonator with minimal supervision. Our approach leverages sample-efficient algorithms to reduce data requirements while maintaining a simple architecture for easy deployment. The reinforcement learning scheme that we have developed shows that automation is feasible even in systems prone to drift in experimental parameters, as may well be the case in real-world applications.

### JuDGE: Benchmarking Judgment Document Generation for Chinese Legal   System
**Authors**: Weihang Su, Baoqing Yue, Qingyao Ai, Yiran Hu, Jiaqi Li, Changyue Wang, Kaiyuan Zhang, Yueyue Wu, Yiqun Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:48:18Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces JuDGE (Judgment Document Generation Evaluation), a novel benchmark for evaluating the performance of judgment document generation in the Chinese legal system. We define the task as generating a complete legal judgment document from the given factual description of the case. To facilitate this benchmark, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of factual descriptions from real legal cases, paired with their corresponding full judgment documents, which serve as the ground truth for evaluating the quality of generated documents. This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement. All the codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/oneal2000/JuDGE.

### Towards a Barrier-free GeoQA Portal: Natural Language Interaction with   Geospatial Data Using Multi-Agent LLMs and Semantic Search
**Authors**: Yu Feng, Puzhen Zhang, Guohui Xiao, Linfang Ding, Liqiu Meng

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:39:46Z

**Summary**: A Barrier-Free GeoQA Portal: Enhancing Geospatial Data Accessibility with a Multi-Agent LLM Framework   Geoportals are vital for accessing and analyzing geospatial data, promoting open spatial data sharing and online geo-information management. Designed with GIS-like interaction and layered visualization, they often challenge non-expert users with complex functionalities and overlapping layers that obscure spatial relationships. We propose a GeoQA Portal using a multi-agent Large Language Model framework for seamless natural language interaction with geospatial data. Complex queries are broken into subtasks handled by specialized agents, retrieving relevant geographic data efficiently. Task plans are shown to users, boosting transparency. The portal supports default and custom data inputs for flexibility. Semantic search via word vector similarity aids data retrieval despite imperfect terms. Case studies, evaluations, and user tests confirm its effectiveness for non-experts, bridging GIS complexity and public access, and offering an intuitive solution for future geoportals.

### Make Your Training Flexible: Towards Deployment-Efficient Video Models
**Authors**: Chenting Wang, Kunchang Li, Tianxiang Jiang, Xiangyu Zeng, Yi Wang, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T13:15:58Z

**Summary**: Popular video training methods mainly operate on a fixed number of tokens sampled from a predetermined spatiotemporal grid, resulting in sub-optimal accuracy-computation trade-offs due to inherent video redundancy. They also lack adaptability to varying computational budgets for downstream tasks, hindering applications of the most competitive model in real-world scenes. We thus propose a new test setting, Token Optimization, for maximized input information across budgets, which optimizes the size-limited set of input tokens through token selection from more suitably sampled videos. To this end, we propose a novel augmentation tool termed Flux. By making the sampling grid flexible and leveraging token selection, it is easily adopted in most popular video training frameworks, boosting model robustness with nearly no additional cost. We integrate Flux in large-scale video pre-training, and the resulting FluxViT establishes new state-of-the-art results across extensive tasks at standard costs. Notably, with 1/4 tokens only, it can still match the performance of previous state-of-the-art models with Token Optimization, yielding nearly 90\% savings. All models and data are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/FluxViT.

### KG-IRAG: A Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Framework for Temporal Reasoning
**Authors**: Ruiyi Yang, Hao Xue, Imran Razzak, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T04:49:29Z

**Summary**: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.

### Decision Tree Induction Through LLMs via Semantically-Aware Evolution
**Authors**: Tennison Liu, Nicolas Huynh, Mihaela van der Schaar

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:52:03Z

**Summary**: Decision trees are a crucial class of models offering robust predictive performance and inherent interpretability across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and logistics. However, current tree induction methods often face limitations such as suboptimal solutions from greedy methods or prohibitive computational costs and limited applicability of exact optimization approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary optimization method for decision tree induction based on genetic programming (GP). Our key innovation is the integration of semantic priors and domain-specific knowledge about the search space into the optimization algorithm. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{LLEGO}$, a framework that incorporates semantic priors into genetic search operators through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby enhancing search efficiency and targeting regions of the search space that yield decision trees with superior generalization performance. This is operationalized through novel genetic operators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively utilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to exploit high-performing regions, and $\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for efficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are controlled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance between exploration and exploitation across the search space. Empirically, we demonstrate across various benchmarks that $\texttt{LLEGO}$ evolves superior-performing trees compared to existing tree induction methods, and exhibits significantly more efficient search performance compared to conventional GP approaches.

**Authors**: Suhwan Choi, Yongjun Cho, Minchan Kim, Jaeyoon Jung, Myunchul Joe, Yubeen Park, Minseo Kim, Sungwoong Kim, Sungjae Lee, Hwiseong Park, Jiwan Chung, Youngjae Yu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:44:59Z

**Summary**: Real-life robot navigation involves more than just reaching a destination; it requires optimizing movements while addressing scenario-specific goals. An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.

**Authors**: Guanglin Zhou, Shaoan Xie, Guang-Yuan Hao, Shiming Chen, Biwei Huang, Xiwei Xu, Chen Wang, Liming Zhu, Lina Yao, Kun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:39:18Z

**Summary**: In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest to understand and model data-generating processes (DGPs) is of paramount importance. Deep generative models (DGMs) have proven adept in capturing complex data distributions but often fall short in generalization and interpretability. On the other hand, causality offers a structured lens to comprehend the mechanisms driving data generation and highlights the causal-effect dynamics inherent in these processes. While causality excels in interpretability and the ability to extrapolate, it grapples with intricacies of high-dimensional spaces. Recognizing the synergistic potential, we delve into the confluence of causality and DGMs. We elucidate the integration of causal principles within DGMs, investigate causal identification using DGMs, and navigate an emerging research frontier of causality in large-scale generative models, particularly generative large language models (LLMs). We offer insights into methodologies, highlight open challenges, and suggest future directions, positioning our comprehensive review as an essential guide in this swiftly emerging and evolving area.

### Why Personalizing Deep Learning-Based Code Completion Tools Matters
**Authors**: Alessandro Giagnorio, Alberto Martin-Lopez, Gabriele Bavota

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:26:06Z

**Summary**: Deep learning (DL)-based code completion tools have transformed software development by enabling advanced code generation. These tools leverage models trained on vast amounts of code from numerous repositories, capturing general coding patterns. However, the impact of fine-tuning these models for specific organizations or developers to boost their performance on such subjects remains unexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by presenting solid empirical evidence answering this question. More specifically, we consider 136 developers from two organizations (Apache and Spring), two model architectures (T5 and Code Llama), and three model sizes (60M, 750M, and 7B trainable parameters). T5 models (60M, 750M) were pre-trained and fine-tuned on over 2,000 open-source projects, excluding the subject organizations' data, and compared against versions fine-tuned on organization- and developer-specific datasets. For the Code Llama model (7B), we compared the performance of the already pre-trained model publicly available online with the same model fine-tuned via parameter-efficient fine-tuning on organization- and developer-specific datasets. Our results show that there is a boost in prediction capabilities provided by both an organization-specific and a developer-specific additional fine-tuning, with the former being particularly performant. Such a finding generalizes across (i) the two subject organizations (i.e., Apache and Spring) and (ii) models of completely different magnitude (from 60M to 7B trainable parameters). Finally, we show that DL models fine-tuned on an organization-specific dataset achieve the same completion performance of pre-trained code models used out of the box and being $\sim$10$\times$ larger, with consequent savings in terms of deployment and inference cost (e.g., smaller GPUs needed).

### Inferring Event Descriptions from Time Series with Language Models
**Authors**: Mingtian Tan, Mike A. Merrill, Zack Gottesman, Tim Althoff, David Evans, Tom Hartvigsen

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:07:33Z

**Summary**: Time series data measure how environments change over time and drive decision-making in critical domains like finance and healthcare. When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation for Topic Modeling in Organizational   Research: An Introduction with Empirical Demonstration
**Authors**: Gerion Spielberger, Florian M. Artinger, Jochen Reb, Rudolf Kerschreiter

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T12:00:26Z

**Summary**: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.

**Authors**: Mehdi Testouri, Gamal Elghazaly, Faisal Hawlader, Raphael Frank

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:59:46Z

**Summary**: Teleoperated driving enables remote human intervention in autonomous vehicles, addressing challenges in complex driving environments. However, its effectiveness depends on ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication. This paper evaluates teleoperated driving over 5G networks, analyzing key performance metrics such as glass-to-glass (G2G) latency, RTT and steering command delay. Using a real-world testbed with a Kia Soul EV and a remote teleoperation platform, we assess the feasibility and limitations of 5G-enabled teleoperated driving. Our system achieved an average G2G latency of 202ms and an RTT of 47ms highlighting the G2G latency as the critical bottleneck. The steering control proved to be mostly accurate and responsive. Finally, this paper provides recommendations and outlines future work to improve future teleoperated driving deployments for safer and more reliable autonomous mobility.

### Variable Time-Step MPC for Agile Multi-Rotor UAV Interception of Dynamic   Targets
**Authors**: Atharva Ghotavadekar, František Nekovář, Martin Saska, Jan Faigl

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:59:24Z

**Summary**: Agile trajectory planning can improve the efficiency of multi-rotor Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in scenarios with combined task-oriented and kinematic trajectory planning, such as monitoring spatio-temporal phenomena or intercepting dynamic targets. Agile planning using existing non-linear model predictive control methods is limited by the number of planning steps as it becomes increasingly computationally demanding. That reduces the prediction horizon length, leading to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed time-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the target neighborhood. In this paper, we propose to address these limitations by introducing variable time steps and coupling them with the prediction horizon length. A simplified point-mass motion primitive is used to leverage the differential flatness of quadrotor dynamics and the generation of feasible trajectories in the flat output space. Based on the presented evaluation results and experimentally validated deployment, the proposed method increases the solution quality by enabling planning for long flight segments but allowing tightly sampled maneuvering.

**Authors**: Somnath Banerjee, Avik Halder, Rajarshi Mandal, Sayan Layek, Ian Soboroff, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:58:48Z

**Summary**: The integration of pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT has revolutionized NLP, particularly for English, but it has also created linguistic imbalances. This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.

**Authors**: Aleksandr Shefer, Igor Engel, Stanislav Alekseev, Daniil Berezun, Ekaterina Verbitskaia, Anton Podkopaev

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:58:00Z

**Summary**: Although formal methods are capable of producing reliable software, they have seen minimal adoption in everyday programming. Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.

**Authors**: Koji Inoue, Mikey Elmers, Divesh Lala, Tatsuya Kawahara

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:50:37Z

**Summary**: Laughter serves as a multifaceted communicative signal in human interaction, yet its identification within dialogue presents a significant challenge for conversational AI systems. This study addresses this challenge by annotating laughable contexts in Japanese spontaneous text conversation data and developing a taxonomy to classify the underlying reasons for such contexts. Initially, multiple annotators manually labeled laughable contexts using a binary decision (laughable or non-laughable). Subsequently, an LLM was used to generate explanations for the binary annotations of laughable contexts, which were then categorized into a taxonomy comprising ten categories, including "Empathy and Affinity" and "Humor and Surprise," highlighting the diverse range of laughter-inducing scenarios. The study also evaluated GPT-4o's performance in recognizing the majority labels of laughable contexts, achieving an F1 score of 43.14%. These findings contribute to the advancement of conversational AI by establishing a foundation for more nuanced recognition and generation of laughter, ultimately fostering more natural and engaging human-AI interactions.

### Lost in Time: Clock and Calendar Understanding Challenges in Multimodal   LLMs
**Authors**: Rohit Saxena, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:43:52Z

**Summary**: Understanding time from visual representations is a fundamental cognitive skill, yet it remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.

### Synthetic Clarification and Correction Dialogues about Data-Centric   Tasks -- A Teacher-Student Approach
**Authors**: Christian Poelitz, Nick McKenna

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:37:25Z

**Summary**: Real dialogues with AI assistants for solving data-centric tasks often follow dynamic, unpredictable paths due to imperfect information provided by the user or in the data, which must be caught and handled. Developing datasets which capture such user-AI interactions is difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we develop a novel framework for synthetically generating controlled, multi-turn conversations between a user and AI assistant for the task of table-based question answering, which can be generated from an existing dataset with fully specified table QA examples for any target domain. Each conversation aims to solve a table-based reasoning question through collaborative effort, modeling one of two real-world scenarios: (1) an AI-initiated clarification, or (2) a user-initiated correction. Critically, we employ a strong teacher LLM to verify the correctness of our synthetic conversations, ensuring high quality. We demonstrate synthetic datasets generated from TAT-QA and WikiTableQuestions as benchmarks of frontier LLMs. We find that even larger models struggle to effectively issuing clarification questions and accurately integrate user feedback for corrections.

### Speculative Decoding for Verilog: Speed and Quality, All in One
**Authors**: Changran Xu, Yi Liu, Yunhao Zhou, Shan Huang, Ningyi Xu, Qiang Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:21:53Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized code generation tasks across various programming languages. However, the unique characteristics of programming languages, particularly those like Verilog with specific syntax and lower representation in training datasets, pose significant challenges for conventional tokenization and decoding approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of speculative decoding for Verilog code generation, showing that it can improve both inference speed and output quality, effectively achieving speed and quality all in one. Unlike standard LLM tokenization schemes, which often fragment meaningful code structures, our approach aligns decoding stops with syntactically significant tokens, making it easier for models to learn the token distribution. This refinement addresses inherent tokenization issues and enhances the model's ability to capture Verilog's logical constructs more effectively. Our experimental results show that our method achieves up to a 5.05x speedup in Verilog code generation and increases pass@10 functional accuracy on RTLLM by up to 17.19% compared to conventional training strategies. These findings highlight speculative decoding as a promising approach to bridge the quality gap in code generation for specialized programming languages.

### Flatness Improves Backbone Generalisation in Few-shot Classification
**Authors**: Rui Li, Martin Trapp, Marcus Klasson, Arno Solin

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:19:45Z

**Summary**: Deployment of deep neural networks in real-world settings typically requires adaptation to new tasks with few examples. Few-shot classification (FSC) provides a solution to this problem by leveraging pre-trained backbones for fast adaptation to new classes. However, approaches for multi-domain FSC typically result in complex pipelines aimed at information fusion and task-specific adaptation without consideration of the importance of backbone training. In this work, we introduce an effective strategy for backbone training and selection in multi-domain FSC by utilizing flatness-aware training and fine-tuning. Our work is theoretically grounded and empirically performs on par or better than state-of-the-art methods despite being simpler. Further, our results indicate that backbone training is crucial for good generalisation in FSC across different adaptation methods.

### Exploring Disparity-Accuracy Trade-offs in Face Recognition Systems: The   Role of Datasets, Architectures, and Loss Functions
**Authors**: Siddharth D Jaiswal, Sagnik Basu, Sandipan Sikdar, Animesh Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T11:04:57Z

**Summary**: Automated Face Recognition Systems (FRSs), developed using deep learning models, are deployed worldwide for identity verification and facial attribute analysis. The performance of these models is determined by a complex interdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and datasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to be disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications, it is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components -- model architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the accuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender prediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten deep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on seven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that all three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both accuracy and disparity. We identify that datasets have an inherent property that causes them to perform similarly across models, independent of the choice of loss functions. Moreover, the choice of dataset determines the model's perceived bias -- the same model reports bias in opposite directions for three gender-balanced datasets of ``in-the-wild'' face images of popular individuals. Studying the facial embeddings shows that the models are unable to generalize a uniform definition of what constitutes a ``female face'' as opposed to a ``male face'', due to dataset diversity. We provide recommendations to model developers on using our study as a blueprint for model development and subsequent deployment.

### Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Seungeun Oh, Jinhyuk Kim, Jihong Park, Seung-Woo Ko, Tony Q. S. Quek, Seong-Lyun Kim

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:50:58Z

**Summary**: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.

### Inference-Time Intervention in Large Language Models for Reliable   Requirement Verification
**Authors**: Paul Darm, James Xie, Annalisa Riccardi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:49:36Z

**Summary**: Steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenge, particularly in engineering applications where precision and reliability are critical. While fine-tuning and prompting methods can modify model behavior, they lack the dynamic and exact control necessary for engineering applications. Inference-time intervention techniques provide a promising alternative, allowing targeted adjustments to LLM outputs. In this work, we demonstrate how interventions enable fine-grained control for automating the usually time-intensive requirement verification process in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Using two early-stage Capella SysML models of space missions with associated requirements, we apply the intervened LLMs to reason over a graph representation of the model to determine whether a requirement is fulfilled. Our method achieves robust and reliable outputs, significantly improving over both a baseline model and a fine-tuning approach. By identifying and modifying as few as one to three specialised attention heads, we can significantly change the model's behavior. When combined with self-consistency, this allows us to achieve perfect precision on our holdout test set.

### Enhancing Kubernetes Resilience through Anomaly Detection and Prediction
**Authors**: V. Anemogiannis, B. Andreou, K. Myrtollari, K. Panagidi, S. Hadjiefthymiades

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:31:29Z

**Summary**: Kubernetes, in recent years, has become widely used for the deployment and management of software projects on cloud infrastructure. Due to the execution of these applications across numerous Nodes, each one with its unique specifications, it has become a challenge to identify problems and ensure the smooth operation of the application. Effective supervision of the cluster remains a challenging and resource intensive task. This research work focuses on providing a novel framework system maintainer in order to overview all the possible resources in Kubernetes and pay the attention to specific parts of the cluster that may be showcasing problematic behavior. The novelty of this component rises from the use of cluster graphical representation where features, e.g. graph edges and neighboring nodes, are used for anomaly detection. The proposed framework defines the normality in the dynamic enviroment of Kubernetes and the output feeds the supervised models for abnormaliry detection presented in user-friendly graph interface. A variety of model combinations are evaluated and tested in real-life environment.

### Can I introduce my boyfriend to my grandmother? Evaluating Large   Language Models Capabilities on Iranian Social Norm Classification
**Authors**: Hamidreza Saffari, Mohammadamin Shafiei, Donya Rooein, Francesco Pierri, Debora Nozza

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:28:01Z

**Summary**: Creating globally inclusive AI systems demands datasets reflecting diverse social norms. Iran, with its unique cultural blend, offers an ideal case study, with Farsi adding linguistic complexity. In this work, we introduce the Iranian Social Norms (ISN) dataset, a novel collection of 1,699 Iranian social norms, including environments, demographic features, and scope annotation, alongside English translations. Our evaluation of 6 Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying Iranian social norms, using a variety of prompts, uncovered critical insights into the impact of geographic and linguistic context. Results revealed a substantial performance gap in LLMs' comprehension of Iranian norms. Notably, while the geographic context in English prompts enhanced the performance, this effect was absent in Farsi, pointing to nuanced linguistic challenges. Particularly, performance was significantly worse for Iran-specific norms, emphasizing the importance of culturally tailored datasets. As the first Farsi dataset for social norm classification, ISN will facilitate crucial cross-cultural analyses, shedding light on how values differ across contexts and cultures.

### DangerMaps: Personalized Safety Advice for Travel in Urban Environments   using a Retrieval-Augmented Language Model
**Authors**: Jonas Oppenlaender

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:18:07Z

**Summary**: Planning a trip into a potentially unsafe area is a difficult task. We conducted a formative study on travelers' information needs, finding that most of them turn to search engines for trip planning. Search engines, however, fail to provide easily interpretable results adapted to the context and personal information needs of a traveler. Large language models (LLMs) create new possibilities for providing personalized travel safety advice. To explore this idea, we developed DangerMaps, a mapping system that assists its users in researching the safety of an urban travel destination, whether it is pre-travel or on-location. DangerMaps plots safety ratings onto a map and provides explanations on demand. This late breaking work specifically emphasizes the challenges of designing real-world applications with large language models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to prompt design and highlight future areas of research.

### GenPara: Enhancing the 3D Design Editing Process by Inferring Users'   Regions of Interest with Text-Conditional Shape Parameters
**Authors**: Jiin Choi, Seung Won Lee, Kyung Hoon Hyun

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:12:29Z

**Summary**: In 3D design, specifying design objectives and visualizing complex shapes through text alone proves to be a significant challenge. Although advancements in 3D GenAI have significantly enhanced part assembly and the creation of high-quality 3D designs, many systems still to dynamically generate and edit design elements based on the shape parameters. To bridge this gap, we propose GenPara, an interactive 3D design editing system that leverages text-conditional shape parameters of part-aware 3D designs and visualizes design space within the Exploration Map and Design Versioning Tree. Additionally, among the various shape parameters generated by LLM, the system extracts and provides design outcomes within the user's regions of interest based on Bayesian inference. A user study N = 16 revealed that \textit{GenPara} enhanced the comprehension and management of designers with text-conditional shape parameters, streamlining design exploration and concretization. This improvement boosted efficiency and creativity of the 3D design process.

### UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation
**Authors**: Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Lingqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T10:07:07Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.

### Growing a Twig to Accelerate Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zhenwei Shao, Mingyang Wang, Zhou Yu, Wenwen Pan, Yan Yang, Tao Wei, Hongyuan Zhang, Ning Mao, Wei Chen, Jun Yu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:52:45Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-world multimodal understanding, yet their high computational overheads pose great challenges for practical deployment. Some recent works have proposed methods to accelerate VLMs by pruning redundant visual tokens guided by the attention maps of VLM's early layers. Despite the success of these token pruning methods, they still suffer from two major shortcomings: (i) considerable accuracy drop due to insensitive attention signals in early layers, and (ii) limited speedup when generating long responses (e.g., 30 tokens). To address the limitations above, we present TwigVLM -- a simple and general architecture by growing a lightweight twig upon an early layer of the base VLM. Compared with most existing VLM acceleration methods purely based on visual token pruning, our TwigVLM not only achieves better accuracy retention by employing a twig-guided token pruning (TTP) strategy, but also yields higher generation speed by utilizing a self-speculative decoding (SSD) strategy. Taking LLaVA-1.5-7B as the base VLM, experimental results show that TwigVLM preserves 96% of the original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens and achieves 154% speedup in generating long responses, delivering significantly better performance in terms of both accuracy and speed over the state-of-the-art VLM acceleration methods. Code will be made publicly available.

### Tuning LLM Judge Design Decisions for 1/1000 of the Cost
**Authors**: David Salinas, Omar Swelam, Frank Hutter

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:09:29Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.

### Learning on LLM Output Signatures for gray-box LLM Behavior Analysis
**Authors**: Guy Bar-Shalom, Fabrizio Frasca, Derek Lim, Yoav Gelberg, Yftah Ziser, Ran El-Yaniv, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:04:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption, yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited, particularly in detecting data contamination and hallucinations. While recently proposed probing techniques provide insights through activation analysis, they require "white-box" access to model internals, often unavailable. Current "gray-box" approaches typically analyze only the probability of the actual tokens in the sequence with simple task-specific heuristics. Importantly, these methods overlook the rich information contained in the full token distribution at each processing step. To address these limitations, we propose that gray-box analysis should leverage the complete observable output of LLMs, consisting of both the previously used token probabilities as well as the complete token distribution sequences - a unified data type we term LOS (LLM Output Signature). To this end, we develop a transformer-based approach to process LOS that theoretically guarantees approximation of existing techniques while enabling more nuanced analysis. Our approach achieves superior performance on hallucination and data contamination detection in gray-box settings, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong transfer capabilities across datasets and LLMs, suggesting that LOS captures fundamental patterns in LLM behavior. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BarSGuy/LLM-Output-Signatures-Network.

### PaCoST: Paired Confidence Significance Testing for Benchmark   Contamination Detection in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Huixuan Zhang, Yun Lin, Xiaojun Wan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:57:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be trained on vast amounts of data, which may unintentionally or intentionally include data from commonly used benchmarks. This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications. To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow. Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs. Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks. We find that almost all models and benchmarks we tested are suspected contaminated more or less. We finally call for new LLM evaluation methods.

### OpenReviewer: A Specialized Large Language Model for Generating Critical   Scientific Paper Reviews
**Authors**: Maximilian Idahl, Zahra Ahmadi

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:37:47Z

**Summary**: We present OpenReviewer, an open-source system for generating high-quality peer reviews of machine learning and AI conference papers. At its core is Llama-OpenReviewer-8B, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top conferences. Given a PDF paper submission and review template as input, OpenReviewer extracts the full text, including technical content like equations and tables, and generates a structured review following conference-specific guidelines. Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer produces considerably more critical and realistic reviews compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5. While other LLMs tend toward overly positive assessments, OpenReviewer's recommendations closely match the distribution of human reviewer ratings. The system provides authors with rapid, constructive feedback to improve their manuscripts before submission, though it is not intended to replace human peer review.

**Authors**: Mihai Nadas, Laura Diosan, Andreea Tomescu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:34:03Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new possibilities for generating synthetic training data in both natural language and code. By producing artificial but task-relevant examples, these models can significantly augment or even replace real-world datasets, especially when labeled data is scarce or sensitive. This paper surveys recent advances in using LLMs to create synthetic text and code, emphasizing prompt-based generation, retrieval-augmented pipelines, and iterative self-refinement. We show how these methods enrich low-resource tasks such as classification and question answering, as well as code-centric applications such as instruction tuning, code translation, and bug repair, by enabling automated verification of functional correctness. Alongside potential benefits like cost-effectiveness, broad coverage, and controllable diversity, we address challenges such as factual inaccuracies in generated text, lack of stylistic realism, and the risk of bias amplification. Proposed mitigations include filtering and weighting outputs and reinforcement learning with execution feedback for code. We conclude with open research directions like automated prompt engineering, cross-modal data synthesis, and robust evaluation frameworks, highlighting the importance of LLM-generated synthetic data in advancing AI while emphasizing ethical and quality safeguards.

**Authors**: Huatong Song, Jinhao Jiang, Yingqian Min, Jie Chen, Zhipeng Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Lei Fang, Ji-Rong Wen

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:32:24Z

**Summary**: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.

### LEGNet: Lightweight Edge-Gaussian Driven Network for Low-Quality Remote   Sensing Image Object Detection
**Authors**: Wei Lu, Si-Bao Chen, Hui-Dong Li, Qing-Ling Shu, Chris H. Q. Ding, Jin Tang, Bin Luo

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:20:24Z

**Summary**: Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) faces formidable challenges in complex visual environments. Aerial and satellite images inherently suffer from limitations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, blurred objects, low-light degradation, and partial occlusions. These degradation factors collectively compromise the feature discriminability in detection models, resulting in three key issues: (1) reduced contrast that hampers foreground-background separation, (2) structural discontinuities in edge representations, and (3) ambiguous feature responses caused by variations in illumination. These collectively weaken model robustness and deployment feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose LEGNet, a lightweight network that incorporates a novel edge-Gaussian aggregation (EGA) module specifically designed for low-quality remote sensing images. Our key innovation lies in the synergistic integration of Scharr operator-based edge priors with uncertainty-aware Gaussian modeling: (a) The orientation-aware Scharr filters preserve high-frequency edge details with rotational invariance; (b) The uncertainty-aware Gaussian layers probabilistically refine low-confidence features through variance estimation. This design enables precision enhancement while maintaining architectural simplicity. Comprehensive evaluations across four RSOD benchmarks (DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0) and a UAV-view dataset (VisDrone2019) demonstrate significant improvements. LEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets while ensuring computational efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices in real-world remote sensing applications. The code is available at https://github.com/lwCVer/LEGNet.

### VideoOrion: Tokenizing Object Dynamics in Videos
**Authors**: Yicheng Feng, Yijiang Li, Wanpeng Zhang, Hao Luo, Zihao Yue, Sipeng Zheng, Zongqing Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:15:28Z

**Summary**: We present VideoOrion, a Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) that explicitly captures the key semantic information in videos - the spatial-temporal dynamics of objects throughout the videos. VideoOrion employs expert vision models to extract object dynamics through a detect-segment-track pipeline, encoding them into a set of object tokens by aggregating spatial-temporal object features. Our method addresses the persistent challenge in Video-LLMs of efficiently compressing high-dimensional video data into semantic tokens that are comprehensible to LLMs. Compared to prior methods which resort to downsampling the original video or aggregating visual tokens using resamplers, leading to information loss and entangled semantics, VideoOrion not only offers a more natural and efficient way to derive compact, disentangled semantic representations but also enables explicit object modeling of video content with minimal computational cost. Moreover, the introduced object tokens naturally allow VideoOrion to accomplish video-based referring tasks. Experimental results show that VideoOrion can learn to make good use of the object tokens, and achieves competitive results on both general video question answering and video-based referring benchmarks.

### Predicting Human Choice Between Textually Described Lotteries
**Authors**: Eyal Marantz, Ori Plonsky

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:10:33Z

**Summary**: Predicting human decision-making under risk and uncertainty is a long-standing challenge in cognitive science, economics, and AI. While prior research has focused on numerically described lotteries, real-world decisions often rely on textual descriptions. This study conducts the first large-scale exploration of human decision-making in such tasks using a large dataset of one-shot binary choices between textually described lotteries. We evaluate multiple computational approaches, including fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging embeddings, and integrating behavioral theories of choice under risk. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs, specifically RoBERTa and GPT-4o outperform hybrid models that incorporate behavioral theory, challenging established methods in numerical settings. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how textual and numerical information influence decision-making and underscore the need for new modeling strategies to bridge this gap.

### LLM-based Unit Test Generation for Dynamically-Typed Programs
**Authors**: Runlin Liu, Zhe Zhang, Yunge Hu, Yuhang Lin, Xiang Gao, Hailong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T08:07:17Z

**Summary**: Automated unit test generation has been widely studied, but generating effective tests for dynamically typed programs remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches, including search-based software testing (SBST) and recent LLM-based methods, often suffer from type errors, leading to invalid inputs and assertion failures, ultimately reducing testing effectiveness. To address this, we propose TypeTest, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in test generation through a vector-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. TypeTest employs call instance retrieval and feature-based retrieval to infer parameter types accurately and construct valid test inputs. Furthermore, it utilizes the call graph to extract richer contextual information, enabling more accurate assertion generation. In addition, TypeTest incorporates a repair mechanism and iterative test generation, progressively refining test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 125 real-world Python modules, TypeTest achieved an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch coverage of 76.8%, outperforming state-of-theart tools by 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

### Query Rewriting via LLMs
**Authors**: Sriram Dharwada, Himanshu Devrani, Jayant Haritsa, Harish Doraiswamy

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:55:40Z

**Summary**: When complex SQL queries suffer slow executions despite query optimization, DBAs typically invoke automated query rewriting tools to recommend ``lean'' equivalents that are conducive to faster execution. The rewritings are usually achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system. Recently, LLM-based techniques have also been suggested, but they are prone to semantic and syntactic errors.   We investigate here how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency. Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths. Further, a suite of logic-based and statistical tools can be used to check for semantic violations in the rewrites prior to DBA consideration.   We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from standard benchmarks on contemporary database platforms. The results show significant performance improvements for slow queries, with regard to both abstract costing and actual execution, over both SOTA techniques and the native query optimizer. For instance, with TPC-DS on PostgreSQL, the geometric mean of the runtime speedups for slow queries was as high as 18.4 over the native optimizer, whereas SOTA delivered 6 in comparison.   Overall, LITHE is a promising step toward viable LLM-based advisory tools for ameliorating enterprise query performance.

### The KoLMogorov Test: Compression by Code Generation
**Authors**: Ori Yoran, Kunhao Zheng, Fabian Gloeckle, Jonas Gehring, Gabriel Synnaeve, Taco Cohen

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:52:04Z

**Summary**: Compression is at the heart of intelligence. A theoretically optimal way to compress any sequence of data is to find the shortest program that outputs that sequence and then halts. However, such 'Kolmogorov compression' is uncomputable, and code generating LLMs struggle to approximate this theoretical ideal, as it requires reasoning, planning and search capabilities beyond those of current models. In this work, we introduce the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence test for code generating LLMs. In KT a model is presented with a sequence of data at inference time, and asked to generate the shortest program that produces the sequence. We identify several benefits of KT for both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem instances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already exist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining data contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, we use audio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic programs. Current flagship models perform poorly - both GPT4-o and Llama-3.1-405B struggle on our natural and synthetic sequences. On our synthetic distribution, we are able to train code generation models with lower compression rates than previous approaches. Moreover, we show that gains on synthetic data generalize poorly to real data, suggesting that new innovations are necessary for additional gains on KT.

### Empowering LLMs in Decision Games through Algorithmic Data Synthesis
**Authors**: Haolin Wang, Xueyan Li, Yazhe Niu, Shuai Hu, Hongsheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:30:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across numerous domains, yet they often struggle with complex reasoning and decision-making tasks. Decision-making games, which inherently require multifaceted reasoning logic, serve as ideal sandboxes for evaluating and enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we first explore whether LLMs can master complex decision-making games through targeted post-training. To this end, we design data synthesis strategies and curate extensive offline datasets from two classic games, Doudizhu and Go. We further develop a suite of techniques to effectively incorporate this data into LLM training, resulting in two novel agents: Mastermind-Dou and Mastermind-Go. Our experimental results demonstrate that these Mastermind LLMs achieve competitive performance in their respective games. Additionally, we explore whether integrating decision-making data can enhance the general reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings suggest that such post-training improves certain aspects of reasoning, providing valuable insights for optimizing LLM data collection and synthesis strategies.

**Authors**: Lu Shi, Yuxuan Xu, Shiyu Wang, Jinhao Huang, Wenhao Zhao, Yufei Jia, Zike Yan, Weibin Gu, Guyue Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:28:11Z

**Summary**: The sim-to-real gap remains a critical challenge in robotics, hindering the deployment of algorithms trained in simulation to real-world systems. This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.

### Navigating Rifts in Human-LLM Grounding: Study and Benchmark
**Authors**: Omar Shaikh, Hussein Mozannar, Gagan Bansal, Adam Fourney, Eric Horvitz

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:24:05Z

**Summary**: Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, early grounding failures predicted later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce RIFTS: a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on RIFTS, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention that mitigates grounding failures.

**Authors**: Xianjie Wu, Jian Yang, Linzheng Chai, Ge Zhang, Jiaheng Liu, Xinrun Du, Di Liang, Daixin Shu, Xianfu Cheng, Tianzhen Sun, Guanglin Niu, Tongliang Li, Zhoujun Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:13:18Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced the interpretation and processing of tabular data, introducing previously unimaginable capabilities. Despite these achievements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges when applied in industrial scenarios, particularly due to the increased complexity of reasoning required with real-world tabular data, underscoring a notable disparity between academic benchmarks and practical applications. To address this discrepancy, we conduct a detailed investigation into the application of tabular data in industrial scenarios and propose a comprehensive and complex benchmark TableBench, including 18 fields within four major categories of table question answering (TableQA) capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce TableLLM, trained on our meticulously constructed training set TableInstruct, achieving comparable performance with GPT-3.5. Massive experiments conducted on TableBench indicate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs still have significant room for improvement to meet real-world demands, where the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieves only a modest score compared to humans.

### Multimodal Mamba: Decoder-only Multimodal State Space Model via   Quadratic to Linear Distillation
**Authors**: Bencheng Liao, Hongyuan Tao, Qian Zhang, Tianheng Cheng, Yingyue Li, Haoran Yin, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T07:02:33Z

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face deployment challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity, growing Key-Value cache requirements, and reliance on separate vision encoders. We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings. Code and models are released at https://github.com/hustvl/mmMamba

### FlexVLN: Flexible Adaptation for Diverse Vision-and-Language Navigation   Tasks
**Authors**: Siqi Zhang, Yanyuan Qiao, Qunbo Wang, Longteng Guo, Zhihua Wei, Jing Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T06:58:41Z

**Summary**: The aspiration of the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task has long been to develop an embodied agent with robust adaptability, capable of seamlessly transferring its navigation capabilities across various tasks. Despite remarkable advancements in recent years, most methods necessitate dataset-specific training, thereby lacking the capability to generalize across diverse datasets encompassing distinct types of instructions. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning and generalization abilities, exhibiting immense potential in robot action planning. In this paper, we propose FlexVLN, an innovative hierarchical approach to VLN that integrates the fundamental navigation ability of a supervised-learning-based Instruction Follower with the robust generalization ability of the LLM Planner, enabling effective generalization across diverse VLN datasets. Moreover, a verification mechanism and a multi-model integration mechanism are proposed to mitigate potential hallucinations by the LLM Planner and enhance execution accuracy of the Instruction Follower. We take REVERIE, SOON, and CVDN-target as out-of-domain datasets for assessing generalization ability. The generalization performance of FlexVLN surpasses that of all the previous methods to a large extent.

### MDocAgent: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document   Understanding
**Authors**: Siwei Han, Peng Xia, Ruiyi Zhang, Tong Sun, Yun Li, Hongtu Zhu, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T06:57:21Z

**Summary**: Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a very common task. Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often prioritize information from a single modal, failing to effectively integrate textual and visual cues. These approaches struggle with complex multi-modal reasoning, limiting their performance on real-world documents. We present MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. Our system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent. These agents engage in multi-modal context retrieval, combining their individual insights to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This collaborative approach enables the system to synthesize information from both textual and visual components, leading to improved accuracy in question answering. Preliminary experiments on five benchmarks like MMLongBench, LongDocURL demonstrate the effectiveness of our MDocAgent, achieve an average improvement of 12.1% compared to current state-of-the-art method. This work contributes to the development of more robust and comprehensive DocQA systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world documents containing rich textual and visual information. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/MDocAgent.

### Survey of Adversarial Robustness in Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chengze Jiang, Zhuangzhuang Wang, Minjing Dong, Jie Gui

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T06:54:59Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in artificial intelligence by facilitating integrated understanding across diverse modalities, including text, images, video, audio, and speech. However, their deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns about adversarial vulnerabilities that could compromise their safety and reliability. Unlike unimodal models, MLLMs face unique challenges due to the interdependencies among modalities, making them susceptible to modality-specific threats and cross-modal adversarial manipulations. This paper reviews the adversarial robustness of MLLMs, covering different modalities. We begin with an overview of MLLMs and a taxonomy of adversarial attacks tailored to each modality. Next, we review key datasets and evaluation metrics used to assess the robustness of MLLMs. After that, we provide an in-depth review of attacks targeting MLLMs across different modalities. Our survey also identifies critical challenges and suggests promising future research directions.

### Improving LLM Video Understanding with 16 Frames Per Second
**Authors**: Yixuan Li, Changli Tang, Jimin Zhuang, Yudong Yang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T06:48:08Z

**Summary**: Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. Upon acceptance, we will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data.
