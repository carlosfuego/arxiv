 ### An Achievable Scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel
**Authors**: Yinbin Ma, Daniela Tuninetti

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:54:42Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a new achievable scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel (K-LCBC). A K-LCBC comprises data stored on a server and K users, each aiming to retrieve a desired linear function of the data by leveraging their prior locally available side information in the form of another linear function of the data. The proposed scheme is based on a subspace decomposition derived from representable polymatroid spaces. This decomposition enables the server to effectively design multicast messages that simultaneously benefit multiple users and allow users to eliminate interference using their available side information. This work extends existing results for the 3-LCBC by introducing a linear programming framework to optimize multicast opportunities across an arbitrary number of users. The proposed approach can be used to derive achievable scheme for the K-user coded caching problem with linear coded placement and scalar linear function retrieval, which was our original motivation to investigate the K-LCBC.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:25:08Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

### VA-CDH: A Variance-Aware Method to Optimize Latency for Caching with   Delayed Hits
**Authors**: Bowen Jiang, Chaofan Ma, Duo Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T00:58:59Z

**Summary**: Caches are fundamental to latency-sensitive systems like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, the delayed hit phenomenon where multiple requests for an object occur during its fetch from the remote server after a miss significantly inflates user-perceived latency. While recent algorithms acknowledge delayed hits by estimating the resulting aggregate delay, they predominantly focus on its mean value. We identify and demonstrate that such approaches are insufficient, as the real aggregate delay frequently exhibits substantial variance in the true production system, leading to suboptimal latency performance when ignored. Thus, we propose VA-CDH, a variance-aware method to optimize latency for caching with delayed hits. It employs a novel ranking function that explicitly incorporates both the empirically estimated mean and standard deviation of aggregate delay, allowing caching decisions to account for its variation. We derive the analytical distribution of aggregate delay under Poisson arrivals as a theoretical contribution, offering more statistical insight beyond the mean value. Through the simulations conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that VA-CDH reduces the total latency by 1%-6% approximately compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

### Tree embedding based mapping system for low-latency mobile applications   in multi-access networks
**Authors**: Yu Mi, Randeep Bhatia, Fang Hao, An Wang, Steve Benno, Tv Lakshman

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T20:30:59Z

**Summary**: Low-latency applications like AR/VR and online gaming need fast, stable connections. New technologies such as V2X, LEO satellites, and 6G bring unique challenges in mobility management. Traditional solutions based on centralized or distributed anchors often fall short in supporting rapid mobility due to inefficient routing, low versatility, and insufficient multi-access support. In this paper, we design a new end-to-end system for tracking multi-connected mobile devices at scale and optimizing performance for latency-sensitive, highly dynamic applications. Our system, based on the locator/ID separation principle, extends to multi-access networks without requiring specialized routers or caching. Using a novel tree embedding-based overlay, we enable fast session setup while allowing endpoints to directly handle mobility between them. Evaluation with real network data shows our solution cuts connection latency to 7.42% inflation over the shortest path, compared to LISP's 359\% due to cache misses. It also significantly reduces location update overhead and disruption time during mobility.

### Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay   using Combinatorial t-Designs
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T17:17:53Z

**Summary**: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

### 3D MPSoC with On-Chip Cache Support -- Design and Exploitation
**Authors**: Rodrigo Cataldo, Cesar Marcon, Debora Matos

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T16:59:13Z

**Summary**: The increasing density of transistors in Integrated Circuits (ICs) has enabled the development of highly integrated Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) and, more recently, Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs). To address scalability challenges in communication and memory performance, three-dimensional (3D) Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures have emerged, offering improvements in communication latency and throughput. However, memory system efficiency remains a critical bottleneck in NoC-based designs. This work proposes the design and experimental exploration of 3D MPSoCs with on-chip cache support by employing distinct communication infrastructures for inter-processor and memory interactions. Specifically, packet-based NoCs are adopted for inter-processor communication, while a crossbar-based infrastructure supports a cache coherence hierarchy for memory access. A two-layer system architecture is introduced, combining a Uniform Memory Access (UMA) model within clusters and a No Remote Memory Access (NORMA) model between clusters, aiming to balance scalability and coherence requirements. Emerging memory technologies such as PCRAM and MRAM are explored to optimize performance, energy consumption, and area usage. Experimental evaluations are conducted using the Gem5 simulator, targeting a model based on the ARM Versatile Express platform. The outcomes of this study aim to enhance MPSoC scalability while meeting the stringent demands of memory-centric applications.

### TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate
**Authors**: Amir Zandieh, Majid Daliri, Majid Hadian, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T15:05:35Z

**Summary**: Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer, demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.

### semi-PD: Towards Efficient LLM Serving via Phase-Wise Disaggregated   Computation and Unified Storage
**Authors**: Ke Hong, Lufang Chen, Zhong Wang, Xiuhong Li, Qiuli Mao, Jianping Ma, Chao Xiong, Guanyu Wu, Buhe Han, Guohao Dai, Yun Liang, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T15:00:03Z

**Summary**: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories: 1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs. The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3) storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and 4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high request rates.   In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM) level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency constraints on Llama series models.

### Soft-Label Caching and Sharpening for Communication-Efficient Federated   Distillation
**Authors**: Kitsuya Azuma, Takayuki Nishio, Yuichi Kitagawa, Wakako Nakano, Takahito Tanimura

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T09:04:30Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Enhanced ERA can be tuned to adapt to non-IID data variations, ensuring robust aggregation and performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

### Characterizing the Optimal Memory-Rate Tradeoff in Secure Coded Caching   for Small Buffer or Small Rate
**Authors**: Han Fang, Nan Liu, Wei Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T09:03:45Z

**Summary**: We consider the secure coded caching problem proposed by Ravindrakumar et. al where no user can obtain information about files other than the one requested. We first propose three new schemes for the three cases of cache size $M=1$, $N=2$ files and arbitrary $K$ users, delivery rate $ R=1$, arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, and the general case for arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, respectively. Then we derive converse results by characterizing new properties of secure coded caching schemes. As a result, we characterize the two end-points of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve for arbitrary number of users and files. Furthermore, for the case of $N=2$ files and arbitrary number of users, we also characterize a segment of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve, where the cache size is relatively small.

### Quantifying Memory Utilization with Effective State-Size
**Authors**: Rom N. Parnichkun, Neehal Tumma, Armin W. Thomas, Alessandro Moro, Qi An, Taiji Suzuki, Atsushi Yamashita, Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T08:12:30Z

**Summary**: The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming increasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To this end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory, to develop a quantitative measure of \textit{memory utilization}: the internal mechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future outputs. This metric, which we call \textbf{\textit{effective state-size}} (ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with \textit{input-invariant} and \textit{input-varying linear operators}, encompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention, convolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which either relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply the total \textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics provide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we show how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform novel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through model distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context delimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural differences in how large language models utilize their available memory to recall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into the dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more efficient and effective sequence models.

**Authors**: Sonia Joseph, Praneet Suresh, Lorenz Hufe, Edward Stevinson, Robert Graham, Yash Vadi, Danilo Bzdok, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Lee Sharkey, Blake Aaron Richards

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T04:31:24Z

**Summary**: Robust tooling and publicly available pre-trained models have helped drive recent advances in mechanistic interpretability for language models. However, similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma (Access the codebase here: https://github.com/Prisma-Multimodal/ViT-Prisma), an open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss. Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

### From Cluster to Desktop: A Cache-Accelerated INR framework for   Interactive Visualization of Tera-Scale Data
**Authors**: Daniel Zavorotny, Qi Wu, David Bauer, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T04:02:30Z

**Summary**: Machine learning has enabled the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) to efficiently compress and reconstruct massive scientific datasets. However, despite advances in fast INR rendering algorithms, INR-based rendering remains computationally expensive, as computing data values from an INR is significantly slower than reading them from GPU memory. This bottleneck currently restricts interactive INR visualization to professional workstations. To address this challenge, we introduce an INR rendering framework accelerated by a scalable, multi-resolution GPU cache capable of efficiently representing tera-scale datasets. By minimizing redundant data queries and prioritizing novel volume regions, our method reduces the number of INR computations per frame, achieving an average 5x speedup over the state-of-the-art INR rendering method while still maintaining high visualization quality. Coupled with existing hardware-accelerated INR compressors, our framework enables scientists to generate and compress massive datasets in situ on high-performance computing platforms and then interactively explore them on consumer-grade hardware post hoc.

### Point-Cache: Test-time Dynamic and Hierarchical Cache for Robust and   Generalizable Point Cloud Analysis
**Authors**: Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Ming Cheng, Yongcai Wang, Deying Li, Chenhui Gou, Jianfei Cai

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T02:58:27Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-Cache.

### AGILE: Lightweight and Efficient Asynchronous GPU-SSD Integration
**Authors**: Zhuoping Yang, Jinming Zhuang, Xingzhen Chen, Alex K. Jones, Peipei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-27T22:05:14Z

**Summary**: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become essential for computationally intensive applications. However, emerging workloads such as recommender systems, graph analytics, and data analytics often involve processing data exceeding GPU on-chip memory capacity. To mitigate this issue, existing solutions enable GPUs to use CPU DRAM or SSDs as external memory. Among them, the GPU-centric approach lets GPU threads directly initiate NVMe requests, eliminating CPU intervention overhead over traditional methods. However, the SOTA GPU-centric approach adopts a synchronous IO model, and threads must tolerate the long latency in communication before starting any tasks.   In this work, we propose AGILE, a lightweight and efficient asynchronous library allowing GPU threads to access SSDs asynchronously while eliminating deadlock risks. AGILE also integrates a flexible software cache using GPU High-Bandwidth Mamory (HBM). We demonstrate that the asynchronous GPU-centric IO achieves up to 1.88$\times$ improvement in workloads with different computation-to-communication (CTC) ratios. We also compare AGILE with the SOTA work BaM on Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) with various settings, and the results show that AGILE achieves 1.75$\times$ performance improvement due to its efficient design and the overlapping strategy enabled by an asynchronous IO model. We further evaluate AGILE's API overhead on graph applications, and the results demonstrate AGILE reduces software cache overhead by up to 3.12$\times$ and overhead in NVMe IO requests by up to 2.85$\times$. Compared with BaM, AGILE consumes fewer registers and exhibits up to 1.32$\times$ reduction in the usage of registers.

### OpenFusion++: An Open-vocabulary Real-time Scene Understanding System
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Jin, Matteo Frosi, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2025-04-27T14:46:43Z

**Summary**: Real-time open-vocabulary scene understanding is essential for efficient 3D perception in applications such as vision-language navigation, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. However, existing methods suffer from imprecise instance segmentation, static semantic updates, and limited handling of complex queries. To address these issues, we present OpenFusion++, a TSDF-based real-time 3D semantic-geometric reconstruction system. Our approach refines 3D point clouds by fusing confidence maps from foundational models, dynamically updates global semantic labels via an adaptive cache based on instance area, and employs a dual-path encoding framework that integrates object attributes with environmental context for precise query responses. Experiments on the ICL, Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate that OpenFusion++ significantly outperforms the baseline in both semantic accuracy and query responsiveness.

### WuNeng: Hybrid State with Attention
**Authors**: Liu Xiao, Li Zhiyuan, Lin Yueyu

**Updated**: 2025-04-27T10:48:56Z

**Summary**: The WuNeng architecture introduces a novel approach to enhancing the expressivity and power of large language models by integrating recurrent neural network (RNN)-based RWKV-7 with advanced attention mechanisms, prioritizing heightened contextual coherence over reducing KV cache size. Building upon the hybrid-head concept from Hymba, WuNeng augments standard multi-head attention with additional RWKV-7 state-driven heads, rather than replacing existing heads, to enrich the model's representational capacity. A cross-head interaction technique fosters dynamic synergy among standard, state-driven, and newly introduced middle heads, leveraging concatenation, additive modulation, and gated fusion for robust information integration. Furthermore, a multi-token state processing mechanism harnesses the continuous RWKV-7 state to capture intricate, sequence-wide dependencies, significantly boosting expressivity. Remarkably, these enhancements are achieved with minimal additional parameters, ensuring efficiency while empowering the model to excel in complex reasoning and sequence generation tasks. WuNeng sets a new standard for balancing expressivity and computational efficiency in modern neural architectures.

### I Know What You Sync: Covert and Side Channel Attacks on File Systems   via syncfs
**Authors**: Cheng Gu, Yicheng Zhang, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh

**Updated**: 2025-04-26T12:07:35Z

**Summary**: Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T19:40:54Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Constructing Hamiltonian Decompositions of Complete $k$-Uniform   Hypergraphs
**Authors**: Javad Maheri, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:45:36Z

**Summary**: Motivated by the wide-ranging applications of Hamiltonian decompositions in distributed computing, coded caching, routing, resource allocation, load balancing, and fault tolerance, our work presents a comprehensive design for Hamiltonian decompositions of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs $K_n^k$. Building upon the resolution of the long-standing conjecture of the existence of Hamiltonian decompositions of complete hypergraphs, a problem that was resolved using existence-based methods, our contribution goes beyond the previous explicit designs, which were confined to the specific cases of $k=2$ and $k=3$, by providing explicit designs for all $k$ and $n$ prime, allowing for a broad applicability of Hamiltonian decompositions in various settings.

### FlexiNS: A SmartNIC-Centric, Line-Rate and Flexible Network Stack
**Authors**: Xuzheng Chen, Jie Zhang, Baolin Zhu, Xueying Zhu, Zhongqing Chen, Shu Ma, Lingjun Zhu, Chao Shi, Yin Zhang, Zeke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:44:38Z

**Summary**: As the gap between network and CPU speeds rapidly increases, the CPU-centric network stack proves inadequate due to excessive CPU and memory overhead. While hardware-offloaded network stacks alleviate these issues, they suffer from limited flexibility in both control and data planes. Offloading network stack to off-path SmartNIC seems promising to provide high flexibility; however, throughput remains constrained by inherent SmartNIC architectural limitations.   To this end, we design FlexiNS, a SmartNIC-centric network stack with software transport programmability and line-rate packet processing capabilities. To grapple with the limitation of SmartNIC-induced challenges, FlexiNS introduces: (a) a header-only offloading TX path; (b) an unlimited-working-set in-cache processing RX path; (c) a high-performance DMA-only notification pipe; and (d) a programmable offloading engine. We prototype FlexiNS using Nvidia BlueField-3 SmartNIC and provide out-of-the-box RDMA IBV verbs compatibility to users. FlexiNS achieves 2.2$\times$ higher throughput than the microkernel-based baseline in block storage disaggregation and 1.3$\times$ higher throughput than the hardware-offloaded baseline in KVCache transfer.

### Demand Private Coded Caching: Small Cache Size
**Authors**: Qinyi Lu, Nan Liu, Wei Kang, Chunguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:43:23Z

**Summary**: We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands, i.e., each user can not gain any information about the demands of other users. We focus on scenarios where the size of users' caches is small, aiming to further characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files, and two MDS-code-based achievable schemes for the case $N \le K$. With a newly derived converse bound for the case $N \le K$, these proposed schemes lead to the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for $M \in \big[0, \frac{N}{(K+1)(N-1)} \big] $ where $N \le K \le 2N-2$, and the optimal memory-rate tradeoff for $M \in \big[0, \frac{1}{K+1} \big] $ where $ K > 2N-2$. Moreover, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, by deriving another new converse bound, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in \big[0,\frac{2}{K}\big] \cup \big[\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2\big]$. Finally, we provide the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users.

### Efficient GNN Training Through Structure-Aware Randomized Mini-Batching
**Authors**: Vignesh Balaji, Christos Kozyrakis, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:16:53Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:08:45Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). That is, C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup. This is so, due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build concurrent communication collectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation   temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$
**Authors**: Haoran Liu, Shaofeng Duan, Xiangqi Liu, Zhihua Liu, Shichong Wang, Lingxiao Gu, Jiongyu Huang, Wenxuan Yang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Yanfeng Guo, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:05:49Z

**Summary**: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

### Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A   first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study
**Authors**: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Sayandeep Ghosh, Bongjae Kim, Chang-Jong Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:41:43Z

**Summary**: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T18:09:25Z

**Summary**: The need for a microscopic description of scintillation light generation in liquid argon becomes increasingly desirable with the upcoming operation of large scale LArTPCs in the next decade. While a detailed mathematical account of the process is still to be achieved, a phenomenological model for simultaneously treating ionization and scintillation, LArQL, has been successfully employed to describe the range of electric fields from 0 to 0.75 kV/cm and dE/dx from 2 to 40 MeV/cm providing the anti-correlation between the free ionization charge and scintillation light. A reanalysis of the original model parameter values has been performed within a global fit procedure and is presented.

### L3: DIMM-PIM Integrated Architecture and Coordination for Scalable   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Qingyuan Liu, Liyan Chen, Yanning Yang, Haocheng Wang, Dong Du, Zhigang Mao, Naifeng Jing, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T14:14:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.   Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.

### Rethinking PM Crash Consistency in the CXL Era
**Authors**: João Oliveira, João Gonçalves, Miguel Matos

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T13:47:35Z

**Summary**: Persistent Memory (PM) introduces new opportunities for designing crash-consistent applications without the traditional storage overheads. However, ensuring crash consistency in PM demands intricate knowledge of CPU, cache, and memory interactions. Hardware and software mechanisms have been proposed to ease this burden, but neither proved sufficient, prompting a variety of bug detection tools.   With the sunset of Intel Optane comes the rise of Compute Express Link (CXL) for PM. In this position paper, we discuss the impact of CXL's disaggregated and heterogeneous nature in the development of crash-consistent PM applications, and outline three research directions: hardware primitives, persistency frameworks, and bug detection tools.

### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T08:39:13Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device.   In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system.   However, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.

### SPAARC: Spatial Proximity and Association based prefetching for   Augmented Reality in edge Cache
**Authors**: Nikhil Sreekumar, Abhishek Chandra, Jon Weissman

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T04:36:20Z

**Summary**: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

### Efficient Pretraining Length Scaling
**Authors**: Bohong Wu, Shen Yan, Sijun Zhang, Jianqiao Lu, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Xun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T04:13:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

### Cognitive Memory in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lianlei Shan, Shixian Luo, Zezhou Zhu, Yu Yuan, Yong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T01:47:25Z

**Summary**: This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

### KeyDiff: Key Similarity-Based KV Cache Eviction for Long-Context LLM   Inference in Resource-Constrained Environments
**Authors**: Junyoung Park, Dalton Jones, Matt J Morse, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T18:02:55Z

**Summary**: In this work, we demonstrate that distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. We explore this phenomenon and propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based on key similarity. This method facilitates the deployment of LLM-based application requiring long input prompts in resource-constrained environments with limited memory and compute budgets. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We demonstrate that KeyDiff computes the optimal solution to a KV cache selection problem that maximizes key diversity, providing a theoretical understanding of KeyDiff. Notably,KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff across diverse tasks and models, illustrating a performance gap of less than 0.04\% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$ 23\% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on the LongBench benchmark for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B.

### Iris: A Next Generation Digital Pathology Rendering Engine
**Authors**: Ryan Erik Landvater, Ulysses Balis

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T15:02:16Z

**Summary**: Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.

### The NIC should be part of the OS
**Authors**: Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T10:48:52Z

**Summary**: The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a cloud server occupying a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to efficient operation of the machine, but unlike compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency.   Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path.   However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernelbypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

### CAOTE: KV Caching through Attention Output Error based Token Eviction
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T05:04:58Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### ML-based Adaptive Prefetching and Data Placement for US HEP Systems
**Authors**: Venkat Sai Suman Lamba Karanam, Sarat Sasank Barla, Byrav Ramamurthy, Derek Weitzel

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T04:21:49Z

**Summary**: Although benefits from caching in US HEP are well-known, current caching strategies are not adaptive i.e they do not adapt to changing cache access patterns. Newer developments such as the High-Luminosity - Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a steady move toward streaming readout based Data Acquisition systems (DAQs) will increase the data production exponentially and hence burden the storage, compute & network infrastructures. Moreover, existing caching frameworks are optimized to reduce latency, but not optimized for storage. This, in combination with limited cache capacities relative to total data, makes it difficult to achieve data locality.   In this work, we present Machine Learning-aided (ML) caching strategies. Specifically, we first present a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) hourly and multi-step cache usage prediction. Second, we present an hourly file-level access prediction model based on CatboostRegressor. To date, most ML-based cache prediction strategies in HEP have focused on daily cache usage and limited works tackled hourly cache usage and even fewer strategies addressed hourly file-level access prediction. File-level access prediction allows for the design of intelligent prefetching and data placement strategies with fine-grained control. We validated our cache prediction strategies using data collected from SoCal MINI caches in August 2024. We are currently extending the WRENCH simulator to reflect the US HEP ecosystem at the storage, network and compute levels. We plan to deploy our cache prediction strategies into WRENCH and later perform extensive analysis with complex data access patterns and candidate infrastructure configurations.

### The Dawn of Disaggregation and the Coherence Conundrum: A Call for   Federated Coherence
**Authors**: Jaewan Hong, Marcos K. Aguilera, Emmanuel Amaro, Vincent Liu, Aurojit Panda, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T23:52:13Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory is an upcoming data center technology that will allow nodes (servers) to share data efficiently. Sharing data creates a debate on the level of cache coherence the system should provide. While current proposals aim to provide coherence for all or parts of the disaggregated memory, we argue that this approach is problematic, because of scalability limitations and hardware complexity. Instead, we propose and formally define federated coherence, a model that provides coherence only within nodes, not across nodes. Federated coherence can use current intra-node coherence provided by processors without requiring expensive mechanisms for inter-node coherence. Developers can use federated coherence with a few simple programming paradigms and a synchronization library. We sketch some potential applications.

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T17:34:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.

### Optimizing SLO-oriented LLM Serving with PD-Multiplexing
**Authors**: Weihao Cui, Yukang Chen, Han Zhao, Ziyi Xu, Quan Chen, Xusheng Chen, Yangjie Zhou, Shixuan Sun, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T15:19:48Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM services demand high throughput and stringent SLO guarantees across two distinct inference phases-prefill and decode-and complex multi-turn workflows. However, current systems face a fundamental tradeoff: out-of-place compute partition enables per-phase SLO attainment, while in-place memory sharing maximizes throughput via KV cache reuse. Moreover, existing in-place compute partition also encounters low utilization and high overhead due to phase-coupling design. We present Drift, a new LLM serving framework that resolves this tension via PD multiplexing, enabling in-place and phase-decoupled compute partition. Drift leverages low-level GPU partitioning techniques to multiplex prefill and decode phases spatially and adaptively on shared GPUs, while preserving in-place memory sharing. To fully leverage the multiplexing capability, Drift introduces an adaptive gang scheduling mechanism, a contention-free modeling method, and a SLO-aware dispatching policy. Evaluation shows that Drift achieves an average $5.1\times$ throughput improvement (up to $17.5\times$) over state-of-the-art baselines, while consistently meeting SLO targets under complex LLM workloads.

### SeaLLM: Service-Aware and Latency-Optimized Resource Sharing for Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Yihao Zhao, Jiadun Chen, Peng Sun, Lei Li, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T09:08:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with different architectures and sizes have been developed. Serving each LLM with dedicated GPUs leads to resource waste and service inefficiency due to the varying demand of LLM requests. A common practice is to share multiple LLMs. However, existing sharing systems either do not consider the autoregressive pattern of LLM services, or only focus on improving the throughput, which impairs the sharing performance, especially the serving latency. We present SeaLLM, which enables service-aware and latency-optimized LLM sharing. SeaLLM improves the overall sharing performance by (1) a latency-optimized scheduling algorithm utilizing the characteristics of LLM services, (2) a placement algorithm to determine the placement plan and an adaptive replacement algorithm to decide the replacement interval, and (3) a unified key-value cache to share GPU memory among LLM services efficiently. Our evaluation under real-world traces and LLM services demonstrates that SeaLLM improves the normalized latency by up to $13.60\times$, the tail latency by up to $18.69\times$, and the SLO attainment by up to $3.64\times$ compared to existing solutions.

### Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory   Controller Design
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T22:13:07Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

**Authors**: Zihao Ye, Lequn Chen, Ruihang Lai, Wuwei Lin, Yineng Zhang, Stephanie Wang, Tianqi Chen, Baris Kasikci, Vinod Grover, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Luis Ceze

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T20:10:11Z

**Summary**: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

### Joint Knowledge and Power Management for Secure Semantic Communication   Networks
**Authors**: Xuesong Liu, Yansong Liu, Haoyu Tang, Fangzhou Zhao, Le Xia, Yao Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:39:59Z

**Summary**: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks.

### Lance: Efficient Random Access in Columnar Storage through Adaptive   Structural Encodings
**Authors**: Weston Pace, Chang She, Lei Xu, Will Jones, Albert Lockett, Jun Wang, Raunak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:22:18Z

**Summary**: The growing interest in artificial intelligence has created workloads that require both sequential and random access. At the same time, NVMe-backed storage solutions have emerged, providing caching capability for large columnar datasets in cloud storage. Current columnar storage libraries fall short of effectively utilizing an NVMe device's capabilities, especially when it comes to random access. Historically, this has been assumed an implicit weakness in columnar storage formats, but this has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of popular columnar formats such as Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Lance in both random access and full scan tasks against NVMe storage.   We argue that effective encoding of a column's structure, such as the repetition and validity information, is the key to unlocking the disk's performance. We show that Parquet, when configured correctly, can achieve over 60x better random access performance than default settings. We also show that this high random access performance requires making minor trade-offs in scan performance and RAM utilization. We then describe the Lance structural encoding scheme, which alternates between two different structural encodings based on data width, and achieves better random access performance without making trade-offs in scan performance or RAM utilization.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:36:53Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:13:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Is Intelligence the Right Direction in New OS Scheduling for Multiple   Resources in Cloud Environments?
**Authors**: Xinglei Dou, Lei Liu, Limin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:09:43Z

**Summary**: Making it intelligent is a promising way in System/OS design. This paper proposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located cloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory bandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources simultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during its scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource cliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling policies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge faster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically learn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using transfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various cloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our experimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower overheads than previous studies.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:40:10Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

### gLLM: Global Balanced Pipeline Parallelism System for Distributed LLM   Serving with Token Throttling
**Authors**: Tianyu Guo, Xianwei Zhang, Jiangsu Du, Zhiguang Chen, Nong Xiao, Yutong Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T00:07:49Z

**Summary**: Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

**Authors**: Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya, Hanjiang Wu, Suvinay Subramanian, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Midhilesh Elavazhagan, Madhu Kumar, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T19:57:16Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

### Slice+Slice Baby: Generating Last-Level Cache Eviction Sets in the Blink   of an Eye
**Authors**: Bradley Morgan, Gal Horowitz, Sioli O'Connell, Stephan van Schaik, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Daniel Genkin, Olaf Maennel, Paul Montague, Eyal Ronen, Yuval Yarom

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T07:53:09Z

**Summary**: An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

### Deuteronomy 2.0: Record Caching and Latch Freedom
**Authors**: David Lomet

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T00:49:27Z

**Summary**: The Deuteronomy transactional key-value store is unique architecturally in providing separation between transaction functionality -- its Transactional Component (TC) and data management -- its Data Component (DC). It is unique in technology by (1) supporting record caching, a smaller unit than the traditional page; and (2) protecting resources during concurrent execution using a latch-free approach. Both technologies are enabled by delta updating. This paper explains how record caching improves cache cost/performance. It also shows how a new latch-free approach makes implementation easier and improves performance.

### A fast MPI-based Distributed Hash-Table as Surrogate Model demonstrated   in a coupled reactive transport HPC simulation
**Authors**: Max Lübke, Marco De Lucia, Stefan Petri, Bettina Schnor

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T18:25:20Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

### Room-temperature high-average-power strong-field terahertz source based   on industrial high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser
**Authors**: Deyin Kong, Yichen Su, Cheng Song, Xiaojun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T06:18:56Z

**Summary**: Free-space strong-field terahertz (THz) pulses, generated via optical rectification of femtosecond lasers in nonlinear crystals, are pivotal in various applications. However, conventional Ti:sapphire lasers struggle to produce high-average-power THz due to their limited output power. While kilowatt ytterbium lasers are increasingly adopted, their application in THz generation faces challenges: low optical-to-THz conversion efficiency (attributed to long pulse durations and low energy) and crystal damage under high pumping power. Here, we report a high-average-power strong-field THz source using a lithium niobate crystal pumped by a 1030-nm, 570-fs, 1-mJ, 50-kHz ytterbium femtosecond laser with tilted pulse front pumping (TPFP). By systematically optimizing TPFP implementations and comparing grating- and echelon-type configurations, we achieve a THz source with 64.5 mW average power at 42-W, 50-kHz pumping, and a focused peak electric field of 525 kV/cm at 0.83-mJ, 1-kHz operation. Additionally, we observe Zeeman torque signals in cobalt-iron ferromagnetic nanofilms. This high-repetition-rate, high-average-power THz system, combined with its potential capabilities in high signal-to-noise spectroscopy and imaging, promises transformative impacts in quantum matter manipulation, non-destructive testing, and biomedicine.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T05:57:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous   Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kang He, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T22:10:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

### Gradual Binary Search and Dimension Expansion : A general method for   activation quantization in LLMs
**Authors**: Lucas Maisonnave, Cyril Moineau, Olivier Bichler, Fabrice Rastello

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:46:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in artificial intelligence, demonstrating strong capabilities in reasoning, understanding, and generating data. However, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by their substantial size, often reaching several billion parameters. Quantization is a widely used method to reduce memory usage and inference time, however LLMs present unique challenges due to the prevalence of outliers in their activations. In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization in LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing outliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization. Our method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40\% increase in accuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of rotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to the Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically demonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We achieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache, significantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple models family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit quantization.

### CacheFormer: High Attention-Based Segment Caching
**Authors**: Sushant Singh, Ausif Mahmood

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:34:57Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts in transformer-based language models with low perplexity is an active area of research. Numerous recent approaches like Linformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs)., have not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss in quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by the cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache miss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent data is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by dividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments in an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the compressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include aggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window attention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k high attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment attention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an architecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average perplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes.

**Authors**: Amit Kumar Bhuyan, Hrishikesh Dutta, Subir Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:13:52Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

**Authors**: Myunghyun Rhee, Joonseop Sim, Taeyoung Ahn, Seungyong Lee, Daegun Yoon, Euiseok Kim, Kyoung Park, Youngpyo Joo, Hosik Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T03:31:08Z

**Summary**: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.

### EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for   Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks
**Authors**: Tianhong Xu, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T00:21:00Z

**Summary**: Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim's activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T23:45:51Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction
**Authors**: Yuchao Gu, Weijia Mao, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T15:26:04Z

**Summary**: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling. The code is released at https://github.com/showlab/FAR.

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T03:51:06Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T00:38:24Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MOM: Memory-Efficient Offloaded Mini-Sequence Inference for Long Context   Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Tianyi Zhu, Cheng Luo, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T23:15:09Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

### Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References
**Authors**: Junhao Zhuang, Lingen Li, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T16:45:19Z

**Summary**: The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

**Authors**: Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Hyunsun Chung, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T07:02:38Z

**Summary**: LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

### Efficient Architecture for RISC-V Vector Memory Access
**Authors**: Hongyi Guan, Yichuan Gao, Chenlu Miao, Haoyang Wu, Hang Zhu, Mingfeng Lin, Huayue Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T05:57:08Z

**Summary**: Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.

### Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference   in RAG-Powered LLMs
**Authors**: Hyungwoo Lee, Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Jungmin So, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, James J. Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T04:59:18Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

### EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G   Networks
**Authors**: Jiahong Ning, Pengyan Zhu, Ce Zheng, Gary Lee, Sumei Sun, Tingting Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T03:07:07Z

**Summary**: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

### Engineering MultiQueues: Fast Relaxed Concurrent Priority Queues
**Authors**: Marvin Williams, Peter Sanders

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T22:38:54Z

**Summary**: Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including prioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy algorithms. In parallel settings, classical priority queues often become a severe bottleneck, resulting in low throughput. Consequently, there has been significant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In this article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed priority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The scalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching operations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high cache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank error, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and delay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given element. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue outperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes shortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications. Moreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and quality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly paradoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest for converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data structures.

### Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory   Constraints
**Authors**: Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T16:00:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:40:25Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

The new unified memory architecture in NVIDIA Grace-Hopper allows high bandwidth cache-coherent memory access of all memory from both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating bottleneck faced in conventional architecture. This breakthrough opens up new avenues for application development and porting strategies. In this study, we introduce a new tool for automatic BLAS offload, the tool leverages the high speed cache coherent NVLink C2C interconnect in Grace-Hopper, and enables performant GPU offload for BLAS heavy applications with no code changes or recompilation. The tool was tested on two quantum chemistry or physics codes, great performance benefits were observed.

### Morphing-based Compression for Data-centric ML Pipelines
**Authors**: Sebastian Baunsgaard, Matthias Boehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T11:02:34Z

**Summary**: Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines -- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input data. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression schemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but struggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed operations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O across the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction parallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature transformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics such as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this paper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless matrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations and engineering to leverage information about structural transformations. Besides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for lightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized compressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial end-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training data-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:34:26Z

**Summary**: AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.

### Shield Bash: Abusing Defensive Coherence State Retrieval to Break Timing   Obfuscation
**Authors**: Kartik Ramkrishnan, Antonia Zhai, Stephen McCamant, Pen Chung Yew

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.

### A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis
**Authors**: Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T12:34:20Z

**Summary**: The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

### Diversity in Network-Friendly Recommendations
**Authors**: Evangelia Tzimpimpaki, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T11:20:56Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

### On Precomputation and Caching in Information Retrieval Experiments with   Pipeline Architectures
**Authors**: Sean MacAvaney, Craig Macdonald

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T08:51:35Z

**Summary**: Modern information retrieval systems often rely on multiple components executed in a pipeline. In a research setting, this can lead to substantial redundant computations (e.g., retrieving the same query multiple times for evaluating different downstream rerankers). To overcome this, researchers take cached "result" files as inputs, which represent the output of another pipeline. However, these result files can be brittle and can cause a disconnect between the conceptual design of the pipeline and its logical implementation. To overcome both the redundancy problem (when executing complete pipelines) and the disconnect problem (when relying on intermediate result files), we describe our recent efforts to improve the caching capabilities in the open-source PyTerrier IR platform. We focus on two main directions: (1) automatic implicit caching of common pipeline prefixes when comparing systems and (2) explicit caching of operations through a new extension package, pyterrier-caching. These approaches allow for the best of both worlds: pipelines can be fully expressed end-to-end, while also avoiding redundant computations between pipelines.

### Secrecy and Privacy in Multi-Access Combinatorial Topology
**Authors**: Mallikharjuna Chinnapadamala, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T07:30:03Z

**Summary**: In this work, we consider the multi-access combinatorial topology with $C$ caches where each user accesses a unique set of $r$ caches. For this setup, we consider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it did not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept private from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when $r\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for $r<C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \textit{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and demand privacy conditions.

### KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLMs Inference
**Authors**: Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T06:58:00Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

### Plato: Plan to Efficiently Decode for Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Yongji Wu, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Atul Prakash, Matthew Lentz, Danyang Zhuo, Feng Qian, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.

### Efficient LLM Serving on Hybrid Real-time and Best-effort Requests
**Authors**: Wan Borui, Zhao Juntao, Jiang Chenyu, Guo Chuanxiong, Wu Chuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:16:57Z

**Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.

### Block-Attention for Efficient Prefilling
**Authors**: Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:02:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.

### AB-Cache: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via   Adams-Bashforth Cached Feature Reuse
**Authors**: Zichao Yu, Zhen Zou, Guojiang Shao, Chengwei Zhang, Shengze Xu, Jie Huang, Feng Zhao, Xiaodong Cun, Wenyi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T08:29:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.

### Sub-nanosecond in-plane magnetization switching induced by field-like   spin-orbit torques from ferromagnets
**Authors**: Hanying Zhang, Ziqian Cui, Baiqing Jiang, Yuan Wang, C. Bi

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T04:46:02Z

**Summary**: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated in SOT-material/ferromagnet structures are classified as damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques for current-driven magnetization switching. It is well known that both DL- and FL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven switching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an incubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching with the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a FL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT, and demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We show that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one order of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because of no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL switching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with one order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching. These results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution for magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.

### Head-Aware KV Cache Compression for Efficient Visual Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Zeren Zhang, Danping Zou, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-12T15:42:17Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have emerged as a powerful approach for multi-modal content creation, offering high efficiency and quality across diverse multimedia applications. However, they face significant memory bottlenecks due to extensive KV cache accumulation during inference. Existing KV cache compression techniques for large language models are suboptimal for VAR models due to, as we identify in this paper, two distinct categories of attention heads in VAR models: Structural Heads, which preserve spatial coherence through diagonal attention patterns, and Contextual Heads, which maintain semantic consistency through vertical attention patterns. These differences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware Compression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and employs pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential characteristics of each head category. Experiments on Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B, and VAR-d30 demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image and class-conditional generation tasks. HACK can hack down up to 50\% and 70\% of cache with minimal performance degradation for VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, respectively. Even with 70\% and 90\% KV cache compression in VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, HACK still maintains high-quality generation while reducing memory usage by 44.2\% and 58.9\%, respectively.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T12:31:07Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### Scaling Up On-Device LLMs via Active-Weight Swapping Between DRAM and   Flash
**Authors**: Fucheng Jia, Zewen Wu, Shiqi Jiang, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianxi Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Yunxin Liu, Ju Ren, Deyu Zhang, Ting Cao

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T09:26:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

### II-NVM: Enhancing Map Accuracy and Consistency with Normal   Vector-Assisted Mapping
**Authors**: Chengwei Zhao, Yixuan Li, Yina Jian, Jie Xu, Linji Wang, Yongxin Ma, Xinglai Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:10:02Z

**Summary**: SLAM technology plays a crucial role in indoor mapping and localization. A common challenge in indoor environments is the "double-sided mapping issue", where closely positioned walls, doors, and other surfaces are mistakenly identified as a single plane, significantly hindering map accuracy and consistency. To address this issue this paper introduces a SLAM approach that ensures accurate mapping using normal vector consistency. We enhance the voxel map structure to store both point cloud data and normal vector information, enabling the system to evaluate consistency during nearest neighbor searches and map updates. This process distinguishes between the front and back sides of surfaces, preventing incorrect point-to-plane constraints. Moreover, we implement an adaptive radius KD-tree search method that dynamically adjusts the search radius based on the local density of the point cloud, thereby enhancing the accuracy of normal vector calculations. To further improve realtime performance and storage efficiency, we incorporate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy, which facilitates efficient incremental updates of the voxel map. The code is released as open-source and validated in both simulated environments and real indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the "double-sided mapping issue" and significantly improves mapping precision. Additionally, we have developed and open-sourced the first simulation and real world dataset specifically tailored for the "double-sided mapping issue".

### Boosting Universal LLM Reward Design through Heuristic Reward   Observation Space Evolution
**Authors**: Zen Kit Heng, Zimeng Zhao, Tianhao Wu, Yuanfei Wang, Mingdong Wu, Yangang Wang, Hao Dong

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:05:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at jingjjjjjie.github.io/LLM2Reward.

**Authors**: Dibyadip Chatterjee, Edoardo Remelli, Yale Song, Bugra Tekin, Abhay Mittal, Bharat Bhatnagar, Necati Cihan Camgöz, Shreyas Hampali, Eric Sauser, Shugao Ma, Angela Yao, Fadime Sener

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T17:13:08Z

**Summary**: We introduce ProVideLLM, an end-to-end framework for real-time procedural video understanding. ProVideLLM integrates a multimodal cache configured to store two types of tokens - verbalized text tokens, which provide compressed textual summaries of long-term observations, and visual tokens, encoded with DETR-QFormer to capture fine-grained details from short-term observations. This design reduces token count by 22x over existing methods in representing one hour of long-term observations while effectively encoding fine-granularity of the present. By interleaving these tokens in our multimodal cache, ProVideLLM ensures sub-linear scaling of memory and compute with video length, enabling per-frame streaming inference at 10 FPS and streaming dialogue at 25 FPS, with a minimal 2GB GPU memory footprint. ProVideLLM also sets new state-of-the-art results on six procedural tasks across four datasets.

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T14:52:03Z

**Summary**: Investigative workflows require interactive exploratory analysis on large heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Current databases show limitations in enabling such task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system that efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging document-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include distributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding, semantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join decomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in path-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency and scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of computing nodes.

### Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based   Program Analysis
**Authors**: Rustam Sadykov, Azat Abdullin, Marat Akhin

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T10:43:42Z

**Summary**: Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.

**Summary**: A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.

**Authors**: Sicheng Mo, Thao Nguyen, Xun Huang, Siddharth Srinivasan Iyer, Yijun Li, Yuchen Liu, Abhishek Tandon, Eli Shechtman, Krishna Kumar Singh, Yong Jae Lee, Bolei Zhou, Yuheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: We propose X-Fusion, a framework that extends pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks while preserving their language capabilities. X-Fusion employs a dual-tower design with modality-specific weights, keeping the LLM's parameters frozen while integrating vision-specific information for both understanding and generation. Our experiments demonstrate that X-Fusion consistently outperforms alternative architectures on both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. We find that incorporating understanding-focused data improves generation quality, reducing image data noise enhances overall performance, and feature alignment accelerates convergence for smaller models but has minimal impact on larger ones. Our findings provide valuable insights into building efficient unified multimodal models.

**Authors**: Evan Li, Tushin Mallick, Evan Rose, William Robertson, Alina Oprea, Cristina Nita-Rotaru

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:55:52Z

**Summary**: LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution.   In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.

### Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior
**Authors**: Neil F. Johnson, Frank Yingjie Huo

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:50:29Z

**Summary**: Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts -- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''

### Real-Time Wayfinding Assistant for Blind and Low-Vision Users
**Authors**: Dabbrata Das, Argho Deb Das, Farhan Sadaf

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:45:04Z

**Summary**: Navigating unfamiliar places continues to be one of the most persistent and essential everyday obstacles for those who are blind or have limited vision (BLV). Existing assistive technologies, such as GPS-based navigation systems, AI-powered smart glasses, and sonar-equipped canes, often face limitations in real-time obstacle avoidance, precise localization, and adaptability to dynamic surroundings. To investigate potential solutions, we introduced PathFinder, a novel map-less navigation system that explores different models for understanding 2D images, including Vision Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and employs monocular depth estimation for free-path detection. Our approach integrates a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on depth images to determine the longest obstacle-free path, ensuring optimal route selection while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted comparative evaluations against existing AI-powered navigation methods and performed a usability study with BLV participants. The results demonstrate that PathFinder achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time responsiveness. Notably, it reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and improves decision-making speed in outdoor navigation compared to AI-based alternatives. Participant feedback emphasizes the system's usability and effectiveness in outside situations, but also identifies issues in complicated indoor locations and low-light conditions. Usability testing revealed that 73% of participants understood how to use the app in about a minute, and 80% praised its balance of accuracy, quick response, and overall convenience.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:42:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal performance impact. However, existing methods often suffer from performance loss without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Further experiments indicate our proposed method is orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, where Wanda++ can be combined with LoRA fine-tuning to achieve a similar perplexity improvement as the Wanda method. The proposed method is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.

### SetKE: Knowledge Editing for Knowledge Elements Overlap
**Authors**: Yifan Wei, Xiaoyan Yu, Ran Song, Hao Peng, Angsheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:40:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as retrieval and question answering but require updates to incorporate new knowledge and reduce inaccuracies and hallucinations. Traditional updating methods, like fine-tuning and incremental learning, face challenges such as overfitting and high computational costs. Knowledge Editing (KE) provides a promising alternative but often overlooks the Knowledge Element Overlap (KEO) phenomenon, where multiple triplets share common elements, leading to editing conflicts. We identify the prevalence of KEO in existing KE datasets and show its significant impact on current KE methods, causing performance degradation in handling such triplets. To address this, we propose a new formulation, Knowledge Set Editing (KSE), and introduce SetKE, a method that edits sets of triplets simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that SetKE outperforms existing methods in KEO scenarios on mainstream LLMs. Additionally, we introduce EditSet, a dataset containing KEO triplets, providing a comprehensive benchmark.

### AegisLLM: Scaling Agentic Systems for Self-Reflective Defense in LLM   Security
**Authors**: Zikui Cai, Shayan Shabihi, Bang An, Zora Che, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:36:05Z

**Summary**: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

### OSVBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Specification Generation Tasks for   Operating System Verification
**Authors**: Shangyu Li, Juyong Jiang, Tiancheng Zhao, Jiasi Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:34:49Z

**Summary**: We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks. The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model. The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system. This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification. Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench.

### Centered plug-in estimation of Wasserstein distances
**Authors**: Tamás P. Papp, Chris Sherlock

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:31:42Z

**Summary**: The plug-in estimator of the squared Euclidean 2-Wasserstein distance is conservative, however due to its large positive bias it is often uninformative. We eliminate most of this bias using a simple centering procedure based on linear combinations. We construct a pair of centered plug-in estimators that decrease with the true Wasserstein distance, and are therefore guaranteed to be informative, for any finite sample size. Crucially, we demonstrate that these estimators can often be viewed as complementary upper and lower bounds on the squared Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply the estimators to Bayesian computation, developing methods for estimating (i) the bias of approximate inference methods and (ii) the convergence of MCMC algorithms.

### Security Steerability is All You Need
**Authors**: Itay Hazan, Idan Habler, Ron Bitton, Itsik Mantin

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:22:55Z

**Summary**: The adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in various applications inevitably comes with expanding the attack surface, combining new security threats along with the traditional ones. Consequently, numerous research and industrial initiatives aim to mitigate these security threats in GenAI by developing metrics and designing defenses. However, while most of the GenAI security work focuses on universal threats (e.g. manipulating the LLM to generate forbidden content), there is significantly less discussion on application-level security and how to mitigate it. Thus, in this work we adopt an application-centric approach to GenAI security, and show that while LLMs cannot protect against ad-hoc application specific threats, they can provide the framework for applications to protect themselves against such threats. Our first contribution is defining Security Steerability - a novel security measure for LLMs, assessing the model's capability to adhere to strict guardrails that are defined in the system prompt ('Refrain from discussing about politics'). These guardrails, in case effective, can stop threats in the presence of malicious users who attempt to circumvent the application and cause harm to its providers. Our second contribution is a methodology to measure the security steerability of LLMs, utilizing two newly-developed datasets: VeganRibs assesses the LLM behavior in forcing specific guardrails that are not security per se in the presence of malicious user that uses attack boosters (jailbreaks and perturbations), and ReverseText takes this approach further and measures the LLM ability to force specific treatment of the user input as plain text while do user try to give it additional meanings...

### Information Gravity: A Field-Theoretic Model for Token Selection in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Maryna Vyshnyvetska

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:21:20Z

**Summary**: We propose a theoretical model called "information gravity" to describe the text generation process in large language models (LLMs). The model uses physical apparatus from field theory and spacetime geometry to formalize the interaction between user queries and the probability distribution of generated tokens. A query is viewed as an object with "information mass" that curves the semantic space of the model, creating gravitational potential wells that "attract" tokens during generation. This model offers a mechanism to explain several observed phenomena in LLM behavior, including hallucinations (emerging from low-density semantic voids), sensitivity to query formulation (due to semantic field curvature changes), and the influence of sampling temperature on output diversity.

### Trace-of-Thought: Enhanced Arithmetic Problem Solving via Reasoning   Distillation From Large to Small Language Models
**Authors**: Tyler McDonald, Ali Emami

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:14:54Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be leveraged for daily tasks, prompt engineering remains an active field of contribution within computational linguistics, particularly in domains requiring specialized knowledge such as arithmetic reasoning. While these LLMs are optimized for a variety of tasks, their exhaustive employment may become computationally or financially cumbersome for small teams. Additionally, complete reliance on proprietary, closed-source models often limits customization and adaptability, posing significant challenges in research and application scalability. Instead, by leveraging open-source models at or below 7 billion parameters, we can optimize our resource usage while still observing remarkable gains over standard prompting approaches. To cultivate this notion, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a simple, zero-shot prompt engineering method that instructs LLMs to create observable subproblems using critical problem-solving, specifically designed to enhance arithmetic reasoning capabilities. When applied to open-source models in tandem with GPT-4, we observe that Trace-of-Thought not only allows novel insight into the problem-solving process but also introduces performance gains as large as 125% on language models at or below 7 billion parameters. This approach underscores the potential of open-source initiatives in democratizing AI research and improving the accessibility of high-quality computational linguistics applications.

### An LLM-Powered Agent for Physiological Data Analysis: A Case Study on   PPG-based Heart Rate Estimation
**Authors**: Mohammad Feli, Iman Azimi, Pasi Liljeberg, Amir M. Rahmani

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:14:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnosis, patient care, and decision support through interactive communication. More recently, they have been applied to analyzing physiological time-series like wearable data for health insight extraction. Existing methods embed raw numerical sequences directly into prompts, which exceeds token limits and increases computational costs. Additionally, some studies integrated features extracted from time-series in textual prompts or applied multimodal approaches. However, these methods often produce generic and unreliable outputs due to LLMs' limited analytical rigor and inefficiency in interpreting continuous waveforms. In this paper, we develop an LLM-powered agent for physiological time-series analysis aimed to bridge the gap in integrating LLMs with well-established analytical tools. Built on the OpenCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, our agent powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model features an orchestrator that integrates user interaction, data sources, and analytical tools to generate accurate health insights. To evaluate its effectiveness, we implement a case study on heart rate (HR) estimation from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using a dataset of PPG and Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in a remote health monitoring study. The agent's performance is benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, with ECG serving as the gold standard for HR estimation. Results demonstrate that our agent significantly outperforms benchmark models by achieving lower error rates and more reliable HR estimations. The agent implementation is publicly available on GitHub.

### Training Plug-n-Play Knowledge Modules with Deep Context Distillation
**Authors**: Lucas Caccia, Alan Ansell, Edoardo Ponti, Ivan Vulić, Alessandro Sordoni

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:11:44Z

**Summary**: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.

### ChestX-Reasoner: Advancing Radiology Foundation Models with Reasoning   through Step-by-Step Verification
**Authors**: Ziqing Fan, Cheng Liang, Chaoyi Wu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:48:23Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in complex tasks, yet medical AI models often overlook the structured reasoning processes inherent in clinical practice. In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy. All resources are open-sourced to facilitate further research in medical reasoning MLLMs.

### DYNAMAX: Dynamic computing for Transformers and Mamba based   architectures
**Authors**: Miguel Nogales, Matteo Gambella, Manuel Roveri

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:38:15Z

**Summary**: Early exits (EEs) offer a promising approach to reducing computational costs and latency by dynamically terminating inference once a satisfactory prediction confidence on a data sample is achieved. Although many works integrate EEs into encoder-only Transformers, their application to decoder-only architectures and, more importantly, Mamba models, a novel family of state-space architectures in the LLM realm, remains insufficiently explored. This work introduces DYNAMAX, the first framework to exploit the unique properties of Mamba architectures for early exit mechanisms. We not only integrate EEs into Mamba but also repurpose Mamba as an efficient EE classifier for both Mamba-based and transformer-based LLMs, showcasing its versatility. Our experiments employ the Mistral 7B transformer compared to the Codestral 7B Mamba model, using data sets such as TruthfulQA, CoQA, and TriviaQA to evaluate computational savings, accuracy, and consistency. The results highlight the adaptability of Mamba as a powerful EE classifier and its efficiency in balancing computational cost and performance quality across NLP tasks. By leveraging Mamba's inherent design for dynamic processing, we open pathways for scalable and efficient inference in embedded applications and resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the transformative potential of Mamba in redefining dynamic computing paradigms for LLMs.

### Relativistic ejecta from stellar mass black holes: insights from   simulations and synthetic radio images
**Authors**: Katie Savard, James H. Matthews, Rob Fender, Ian Heywood

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:33:54Z

**Summary**: We present numerical simulations of discrete relativistic ejecta from an X-ray binary (XRB) with initial conditions directly informed by observations. XRBs have been observed to launch powerful discrete plasma ejecta during state transitions, which can propagate up to parsec distances. Understanding these ejection events unveils new understanding of jet-launching, jet power, and jet-ISM interaction among other implications. Multi-frequency quasi-simultaneous radio observations of ejecta from the black hole XRB MAXI J1820+070 produced both size and calorimetry constraints, which we use as initial conditions of a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation. We qualitatively reproduce the observed deceleration of the ejecta in a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM). Our simulations demonstrate that the ejecta must be denser than the ISM, the ISM be significantly low-density, and the launch be extremely powerful, in order to propagate to the observed distances. The blob propagates and clears out a high-pressure low-density cavity in its wake, providing an explanation for this pre-existing low-density environment, as well as 'bubble-like' environments in the vicinity of XRBs inferred from other studies. As the blob decelerates, we observe the onset of instabilities and a long-lived reverse shock -- these mechanisms convert kinetic to internal energy in the blob, responsible for in-situ particle acceleration. We transform the outputs of our simulation into pseudo-radio images, incorporating the u,v coverage of the MeerKAT and e-MERLIN telescopes from the original observations with real-sky background. Through this, we maximize the interpretability of the results and provide direct comparison to current data, as well as provide prediction capabilities.

### An Empirical Study on the Capability of LLMs in Decomposing Bug Reports
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Chen, Vanessa Nava-Camal, Ahmad Suleiman, Yiming Tang, Daqing Hou, Weiyi Shang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:29:12Z

**Summary**: Background: Bug reports are essential to the software development life cycle. They help developers track and resolve issues, but are often difficult to process due to their complexity, which can delay resolution and affect software quality. Aims: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can assist developers in automatically decomposing complex bug reports into smaller, self-contained units, making them easier to understand and address. Method: We conducted an empirical study on 127 resolved privacy-related bug reports collected from Apache Jira. We evaluated ChatGPT and DeepSeek using different prompting strategies. We first tested both LLMs with zero-shot prompts, then applied improved prompts with demonstrations (using few-shot prompting) to measure their abilities in bug decomposition. Results: Our findings show that LLMs are capable of decomposing bug reports, but their overall performance still requires further improvement and strongly depends on the quality of the prompts. With zero-shot prompts, both studied LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) performed poorly. After prompt tuning, ChatGPT's true decomposition rate increased by 140\% and DeepSeek's by 163.64\%. Conclusions: LLMs show potential in helping developers analyze and decompose complex bug reports, but they still need improvement in terms of accuracy and bug understanding.

**Authors**: Shamit Fatin, Mehbubul Hasan Al-Quvi, Haz Sameen Shahgir, Sukarna Barua, Anindya Iqbal, Sadia Sharmin, Md. Mostofa Akbar, Kallol Kumar Pal, A. Asif Al Rashid

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:13:49Z

**Summary**: Given natural language test case description for an Android application, existing testing approaches require developers to manually write scripts using tools such as Appium and Espresso to execute the corresponding test case. This process is labor-intensive and demands significant effort to maintain as UI interfaces evolve throughout development. In this work, we introduce LELANTE, a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate test case execution without requiring pre-written scripts. LELANTE interprets natural language test case descriptions, iteratively generate action plans, and perform the actions directly on the Android screen using its GUI. LELANTE employs a screen refinement process to enhance LLM interpretability, constructs a structured prompt for LLMs, and implements an action generation mechanism based on chain-of-thought reasoning of LLMs. To further reduce computational cost and enhance scalability, LELANTE utilizes model distillation using a foundational LLM. In experiments across 390 test cases spanning 10 popular Android applications, LELANTE achieved a 73% test execution success rate. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively bridge the gap between natural language test case description and automated execution, making mobile testing more scalable and adaptable.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:56:46Z

**Summary**: Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.

### UP-dROM : Uncertainty-Aware and Parametrised dynamic Reduced-Order   Model, application to unsteady flows
**Authors**: Ismaël Zighed, Nicolas Thome, Patrick Gallinari, Taraneh Sayadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:51:44Z

**Summary**: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.

**Summary**: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field

### Bayesian Optimization-based Tire Parameter and Uncertainty Estimation   for Real-World Data
**Authors**: Sven Goblirsch, Benedikt Ruhland, Johannes Betz, Markus Lienkamp

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:39:10Z

**Summary**: This work presents a methodology to estimate tire parameters and their uncertainty using a Bayesian optimization approach. The literature mainly considers the estimation of tire parameters but lacks an evaluation of the parameter identification quality and the required slip ratios for an adequate model fit. Therefore, we examine the use of Stochastical Variational Inference as a methodology to estimate both - the parameters and their uncertainties. We evaluate the method compared to a state-of-the-art Nelder-Mead algorithm for theoretical and real-world application. The theoretical study considers parameter fitting at different slip ratios to evaluate the required excitation for an adequate fitting of each parameter. The results are compared to a sensitivity analysis for a Pacejka Magic Formula tire model. We show the application of the algorithm on real-world data acquired during the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League and highlight the uncertainties in identifying the curvature and shape parameters due to insufficient excitation. The gathered insights can help assess the acquired data's limitations and instead utilize standardized parameters until higher slip ratios are captured. We show that our proposed method can be used to assess the mean values and the uncertainties of tire model parameters in real-world conditions and derive actions for the tire modeling based on our simulative study.

### Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yunjia Qi, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:38:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### Optimizing Personalized Federated Learning through Adaptive Layer-Wise   Learning
**Authors**: Weihang Chen, Cheng Yang, Jie Ren, Zhiqiang Li, Zheng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:33:00Z

**Summary**: Real-life deployment of federated Learning (FL) often faces non-IID data, which leads to poor accuracy and slow convergence. Personalized FL (pFL) tackles these issues by tailoring local models to individual data sources and using weighted aggregation methods for client-specific learning. However, existing pFL methods often fail to provide each local model with global knowledge on demand while maintaining low computational overhead. Additionally, local models tend to over-personalize their data during the training process, potentially dropping previously acquired global information. We propose FLAYER, a novel layer-wise learning method for pFL that optimizes local model personalization performance. FLAYER considers the different roles and learning abilities of neural network layers of individual local models. It incorporates global information for each local model as needed to initialize the local model cost-effectively. It then dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer during local training, optimizing the personalized learning process for each local model while preserving global knowledge. Additionally, to enhance global representation in pFL, FLAYER selectively uploads parameters for global aggregation in a layer-wise manner. We evaluate FLAYER on four representative datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. Compared to six state-of-the-art pFL methods, FLAYER improves the inference accuracy, on average, by 5.40\% (up to 14.29\%).

### Agentic AI: The Era of Semantic Decoding
**Authors**: Maxime Peyrard, Martin Josifoski, Robert West

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:24:52Z

**Summary**: Recent work demonstrated great promise in the idea of orchestrating collaborations between LLMs, human input, and various tools to address the inherent limitations of LLMs. We propose a novel perspective called semantic decoding, which frames these collaborative processes as optimization procedures in semantic space. Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens (known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors, including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors. Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much greater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize the transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between syntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding algorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions arising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers a powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new type of computation.

### JaccDiv: A Metric and Benchmark for Quantifying Diversity of Generated   Marketing Text in the Music Industry
**Authors**: Anum Afzal, Alexandre Mercier, Florian Matthes

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:19:06Z

**Summary**: Online platforms are increasingly interested in using Data-to-Text technologies to generate content and help their users. Unfortunately, traditional generative methods often fall into repetitive patterns, resulting in monotonous galleries of texts after only a few iterations. In this paper, we investigate LLM-based data-to-text approaches to automatically generate marketing texts that are of sufficient quality and diverse enough for broad adoption. We leverage Language Models such as T5, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMa2 in conjunction with fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot approaches to set a baseline for diverse marketing texts. We also introduce a metric JaccDiv to evaluate the diversity of a set of texts. This research extends its relevance beyond the music industry, proving beneficial in various fields where repetitive automated content generation is prevalent.

### Virology Capabilities Test (VCT): A Multimodal Virology Q&A Benchmark
**Authors**: Jasper Götting, Pedro Medeiros, Jon G Sanders, Nathaniel Li, Long Phan, Karam Elabd, Lennart Justen, Dan Hendrycks, Seth Donoughe

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:14:35Z

**Summary**: We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.

### RadSAM: Segmenting 3D radiological images with a 2D promptable model
**Authors**: Julien Khlaut, Elodie Ferreres, Daniel Tordjman, Hélène Philippe, Tom Boeken, Pierre Manceron, Corentin Dancette

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:00:25Z

**Summary**: Medical image segmentation is a crucial and time-consuming task in clinical care, where mask precision is extremely important. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a promising approach, as it provides an interactive interface based on visual prompting and edition to refine an initial segmentation. This model has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined classes, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural images and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition, this model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on 3D images, such as CT and MRI. Recent adaptations of SAM for medical imaging are based on 2D models, thus requiring one prompt per slice to segment 3D objects, making the segmentation process tedious. They also lack important features such as editing. To bridge this gap, we propose RadSAM, a novel method for segmenting 3D objects with a 2D model from a single prompt. In practice, we train a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding boxes and points. We then use this novel prompt type with an iterative inference pipeline to reconstruct the 3D mask slice-by-slice. We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the model's ability to segment 3D objects in CT images from a single prompt and evaluate the models' out-of-domain transfer and edition capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against state-of-the-art models on this benchmark using the AMOS abdominal organ segmentation dataset.

### Enhancing Non-Core Language Instruction-Following in Speech LLMs via   Semi-Implicit Cross-Lingual CoT Reasoning
**Authors**: Hongfei Xue, Yufeng Tang, Hexin Liu, Jun Zhang, Xuelong Geng, Lei Xie

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:59:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs). While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs. The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities. To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training. By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN. Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores. Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages. To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French.

### Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning Under Memory Constraints
**Authors**: Alan Lee, Harry Tong

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:58:43Z

**Summary**: We explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance reasoning within targeted problem spaces in large language models (LLMs) under memory and compute constraints. Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.

### GaussTrap: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on 3D Gaussian Splatting for   Targeted Scene Confusion
**Authors**: Jiaxin Hong, Sixu Chen, Shuoyang Sun, Hongyao Yu, Hao Fang, Yuqi Tan, Bin Chen, Shuhan Qi, Jiawei Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:52:14Z

**Summary**: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a breakthrough in scene representation and novel view synthesis, its rapid adoption in safety-critical domains (e.g., autonomous systems, AR/VR) urgently demands scrutiny of potential security vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.

### Ascendra: Dynamic Request Prioritization for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Azam Ikram, Xiang Li, Sameh Elnikety, Saurabh Bagchi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:51:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for more efficient serving strategies. In this context, efficiency refers to the proportion of requests that meet their Service Level Objectives (SLOs), particularly for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). However, existing systems often prioritize one metric at the cost of the other. We present Ascendra, an LLM serving system designed to meet both TTFT and TBT SLOs simultaneously. The core insight behind Ascendra is that a request's urgency evolves as it approaches its deadline. To leverage this, Ascendra partitions GPU resources into two types of instances: low-priority and high-priority. Low-priority instances maximize throughput by processing requests out of arrival order, but at the risk of request starvation. To address this, Ascendra employs a performance model to predict requests at risk of missing their SLOs and proactively offloads them to high-priority instances. High-priority instances are optimized for low-latency execution and handle urgent requests nearing their deadlines. This partitioned architecture enables Ascendra to effectively balance high throughput and low latency. Extensive evaluation shows that Ascendra improves system throughput by up to 1.7x compared to vLLM and Sarathi-Serve while meeting both TTFT and TBT SLOs.

### Higher order definition of causality by optimally conditioned transfer   entropy
**Authors**: Jakub Kořenek, Pavel Sanda, Jaroslav Hlinka

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:47:20Z

**Summary**: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.

### LocAgent: Graph-Guided LLM Agents for Code Localization
**Authors**: Zhaoling Chen, Xiangru Tang, Gangda Deng, Fang Wu, Jialong Wu, Zhiwei Jiang, Viktor Prasanna, Arman Cohan, Xingyao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:37:43Z

**Summary**: Code localization--identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made--is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10). Our code is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/LocAgent.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:25:08Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

### SoccerDiffusion: Toward Learning End-to-End Humanoid Robot Soccer from   Gameplay Recordings
**Authors**: Florian Vahl, Jörn Griepenburg, Jan Gutsche, Jasper Güldenstein, Jianwei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:21:08Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces SoccerDiffusion, a transformer-based diffusion model designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots. Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference optimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code under: https://bit-bots.github.io/SoccerDiffusion

### Hallucination by Code Generation LLMs: Taxonomy, Benchmarks, Mitigation,   and Challenges
**Authors**: Yunseo Lee, John Youngeun Song, Dongsun Kim, Jindae Kim, Mijung Kim, Jaechang Nam

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:13:57Z

**Summary**: Recent technical breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have enabled them to fluently generate source code. Software developers often leverage both general-purpose and code-specialized LLMs to revise existing code or even generate a whole function from scratch. These capabilities are also beneficial in no-code or low-code contexts, in which one can write programs without a technical background. However, due to their internal design, LLMs are prone to generating hallucinations, which are incorrect, nonsensical, and not justifiable information but difficult to identify its presence. This problem also occurs when generating source code. Once hallucinated code is produced, it is often challenging for users to identify and fix it, especially when such hallucinations can be identified under specific execution paths. As a result, the hallucinated code may remain unnoticed within the codebase. This survey investigates recent studies and techniques relevant to hallucinations generated by CodeLLMs. We categorize the types of hallucinations in the code generated by CodeLLMs, review existing benchmarks and mitigation strategies, and identify open challenges. Based on these findings, this survey outlines further research directions in the detection and removal of hallucinations produced by CodeLLMs.

### Q-Fusion: Diffusing Quantum Circuits
**Authors**: Collin Beaudoin, Swaroop Ghosh

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:10:10Z

**Summary**: Quantum computing holds great potential for solving socially relevant and computationally complex problems. Furthermore, quantum machine learning (QML) promises to rapidly improve our current machine learning capabilities. However, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by limitations in the number of qubits and gate counts, which hinder their full capabilities. Furthermore, the design of quantum algorithms remains a laborious task, requiring significant domain expertise and time. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel quantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to generate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that utilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational autoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently generates 100% valid quantum circuit outputs.

**Summary**: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.

**Authors**: Xiyu Zhou, Ruiyin Li, Peng Liang, Beiqi Zhang, Mojtaba Shahin, Zengyang Li, Chen Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:00:18Z

**Summary**: Design Rationale (DR) for software architecture decisions refers to the reasoning underlying architectural choices, which provides valuable insights into the different phases of the architecting process throughout software development. However, in practice, DR is often inadequately documented due to a lack of motivation and effort from developers. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in text comprehension, reasoning, and generation may enable the generation and recovery of DR for architecture decisions. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in generating DR for architecture decisions. First, we collected 50 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, 25 GitHub issues, and 25 GitHub discussions related to architecture decisions to construct a dataset of 100 architecture-related problems. Then, we selected five LLMs to generate DR for the architecture decisions with three prompting strategies, including zero-shot, chain of thought (CoT), and LLM-based agents. With the DR provided by human experts as ground truth, the Precision of LLM-generated DR with the three prompting strategies ranges from 0.267 to 0.278, Recall from 0.627 to 0.715, and F1-score from 0.351 to 0.389. Additionally, 64.45% to 69.42% of the arguments of DR not mentioned by human experts are also helpful, 4.12% to 4.87% of the arguments have uncertain correctness, and 1.59% to 3.24% of the arguments are potentially misleading. Based on the results, we further discussed the pros and cons of the three prompting strategies and the strengths and limitations of the DR generated by LLMs.

**Authors**: Khaoula Chehbouni, Jonathan Colaço Carr, Yash More, Jackie CK Cheung, Golnoosh Farnadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:58:44Z

**Summary**: In an effort to mitigate the harms of large language models (LLMs), learning from human feedback (LHF) has been used to steer LLMs towards outputs that are intended to be both less harmful and more helpful. Despite the widespread adoption of LHF in practice, the quality of this feedback and its effectiveness as a safety mitigation technique remain unclear. This study addresses these issues by auditing the widely-used Helpful and Harmless (HH) dataset by Anthropic. Our work includes: (1) a thorough investigation of the dataset's content through both manual and automated evaluation; (2) experiments demonstrating the dataset's impact on models' safety; and (3) an analysis of the 100 most influential papers citing this dataset. Through our audit, we showcase how conceptualization failures and quality issues identified in the HH dataset can create additional harms by leading to disparate safety behaviors across demographic groups. Our findings highlight the need for more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to safety mitigation in LLMs.

### Decorrelation in Complex Wave Scattering
**Authors**: Qihang Zhang, Haoyu Yue, Ninghe Liu, Danlin Xu, Renjie Zhou, Liangcai Cao, George Barbastathis

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:55:04Z

**Summary**: Phenomena involving multiple scattering, despite having attracted considerable attention in physics for decades, continue to generate unexpected and counterintuitive behaviours prompting further studies. For optical scattering, the memory effect well predicts fourth order statistics, i.e. the intensity correlation, as long as the scattering strength and depth are within certain bounds. The memory effect has found a wide range of applications, where its limitations also become apparent: for example, in imaging through turbid media, decorrelation due to multiscattering in thick samples has been shown to restrict the field of view. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive mechanism exists to date that can account for decorrelation precisely. In this paper, we quantify how the scatterer's own statistics determine such limitations. We show that the ensemble statistics of the backscattered field may be decomposed into two terms: one expresses surface scattering, where statistical distributions of multiscale structure features may be inferred from our previous works; while the second term originates from the underlying scattering volume and is diffusive. The new framework agrees well with experiments, including the prediction of a new quasipower law for fluctuations induced by the single realization.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:53:33Z

**Summary**: Currently available tools for the automated acoustic recognition of European insects in natural soundscapes are limited in scope. Large and ecologically heterogeneous acoustic datasets are currently needed for these algorithms to cross-contextually recognize the subtle and complex acoustic signatures produced by each species, thus making the availability of such datasets a key requisite for their development. Here we present ECOSoundSet (European Cicadidae and Orthoptera Sound dataSet), a dataset containing 10,653 recordings of 200 orthopteran and 24 cicada species (217 and 26 respective taxa when including subspecies) present in North, Central, and temperate Western Europe (Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, mainland France and Corsica, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland), collected partly through targeted fieldwork in South France and Catalonia and partly through contributions from various European entomologists. The dataset is composed of a combination of coarsely labeled recordings, for which we can only infer the presence, at some point, of their target species (weak labeling), and finely annotated recordings, for which we know the specific time and frequency range of each insect sound present in the recording (strong labeling). We also provide a train/validation/test split of the strongly labeled recordings, with respective approximate proportions of 0.8, 0.1 and 0.1, in order to facilitate their incorporation in the training and evaluation of deep learning algorithms. This dataset could serve as a meaningful complement to recordings already available online for the training of deep learning algorithms for the acoustic classification of orthopterans and cicadas in North, Central, and temperate Western Europe.

### Turing Machine Evaluation for Large Language Model
**Authors**: Haitao Wu, Zongbo Han, Huaxi Huang, Changqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:52:47Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development and widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), rigorous evaluation has become particularly crucial. This research adopts a novel perspective, focusing on evaluating the core computational reasoning ability of LLMs, defined as the capacity of model to accurately understand rules, and execute logically computing operations. This capability assesses the reliability of LLMs as precise executors, and is critical to advanced tasks such as complex code generation and multi-step problem-solving. We propose an evaluation framework based on Universal Turing Machine (UTM) simulation. This framework requires LLMs to strictly follow instructions and track dynamic states, such as tape content and read/write head position, during multi-step computations. To enable standardized evaluation, we developed TMBench, a benchmark for systematically studying the computational reasoning capabilities of LLMs. TMBench provides several key advantages, including knowledge-agnostic evaluation, adjustable difficulty, foundational coverage through Turing machine encoding, and unlimited capacity for instance generation, ensuring scalability as models continue to evolve. We find that model performance on TMBench correlates strongly with performance on other recognized reasoning benchmarks (Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.73), clearly demonstrating that computational reasoning is a significant dimension for measuring the deep capabilities of LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HaitaoWuTJU/Turing-Machine-Bench.

### Understanding Large Language Model Supply Chain: Structure, Domain, and   Vulnerabilities
**Authors**: Yanzhe Hu, Shenao Wang, Tianyuan Nie, Yanjie Zhao, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:44:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI), driving breakthroughs in natural language understanding, text generation, and autonomous systems. However, the rapid growth of LLMs presents significant challenges in the security and reliability of the Large Language Model Supply Chain (LLMSC), a complex network of open-source components, libraries, and tools essential for LLM development and deployment. Despite its critical importance, the LLMSC remains underexplored, particularly regarding its structural characteristics, domain composition, and security vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct the first empirical study of the LLMSC, analyzing a curated dataset of open-source packages from PyPI and NPM across 14 functional domains. We construct a directed dependency graph comprising 15,725 nodes, 10,402 edges, and 180 unique vulnerabilities to investigate the structural characteristics of the LLMSC and analyze how security risks propagate through its dependency network. Our findings reveal that the LLMSC exhibits a ``locally dense, globally sparse'' topology, with 79.7% of dependency trees containing fewer than 5 nodes, while a few large trees dominate the ecosystem, accounting for 77.66% of all nodes. The graph is characterized by high-degree hubs, with the top 5 most connected nodes averaging 1,282 dependents each. Security analysis shows that critical vulnerabilities propagate to an average of 142.1 nodes at the second layer of dependency trees and peak at 237.8 affected nodes at the third layer. Notably, cascading risks are concentrated in critical hub nodes such as transformers, which directly or indirectly affect over 1,300 downstream packages. These findings provide quantitative insights into the structural and security dynamics of the LLMSC and emphasize the need for targeted mitigation strategies to enhance ecosystem resilience.

### Multi-mode Pulsations in AGB Stars: Insights from 3D RHD CO5BOLD   Simulations
**Authors**: Arief Ahmad, Bernd Freytag, Susanne Höfner

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:43:16Z

**Summary**: Stars on the AGB can exhibit acoustic pulsation modes of different radial orders, along with non-radial modes. These pulsations are essential to the mass-loss process and influence the evolutionary pathways of AGB stars. P-L relations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution along the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating pulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear coupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB stars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code. Signatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models. Our focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes, examining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D model predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new model grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and $1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic, time-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their corresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to identify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce the P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in both the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to infer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations highlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial and non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and oscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing the non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode switching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss events.

### LLM-Generated Fake News Induces Truth Decay in News Ecosystem: A Case   Study on Neural News Recommendation
**Authors**: Beizhe Hu, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Yang Li, Danding Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:41:59Z

**Summary**: Online fake news moderation now faces a new challenge brought by the malicious use of large language models (LLMs) in fake news production. Though existing works have shown LLM-generated fake news is hard to detect from an individual aspect, it remains underexplored how its large-scale release will impact the news ecosystem. In this study, we develop a simulation pipeline and a dataset with ~56k generated news of diverse types to investigate the effects of LLM-generated fake news within neural news recommendation systems. Our findings expose a truth decay phenomenon, where real news is gradually losing its advantageous position in news ranking against fake news as LLM-generated news is involved in news recommendation. We further provide an explanation about why truth decay occurs from a familiarity perspective and show the positive correlation between perplexity and news ranking. Finally, we discuss the threats of LLM-generated fake news and provide possible countermeasures. We urge stakeholders to address this emerging challenge to preserve the integrity of news ecosystems.

### Influence network reconstruction from discrete time-series of count data   modelled by multidimensional Hawkes processes
**Authors**: Naratip Santitissadeekorn, Martin Short, David J. B. Lloyd

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:37:36Z

**Summary**: Identifying key influencers from time series data without a known prior network structure is a challenging problem in various applications, from crime analysis to social media. While much work has focused on event-based time series (timestamp) data, fewer methods address count data, where event counts are recorded in fixed intervals. We develop network inference methods for both batched and sequential count data. Here the strong network connection represents the key influences among the nodes. We introduce an ensemble-based algorithm, rooted in the expectation-maximization (EM) framework, and demonstrate its utility to identify node dynamics and connections through a discrete-time Cox or Hawkes process. For the linear multidimensional Hawkes model, we employ a minimization-majorization (MM) approach, allowing for parallelized inference of networks. For sequential inference, we use a second-order approximation of the Bayesian inference problem. Under certain assumptions, a rank-1 update for the covariance matrix reduces computational costs. We validate our methods on synthetic data and real-world datasets, including email communications within European academic communities. Our approach effectively reconstructs underlying networks, accounting for both excitation and diffusion influences. This work advances network reconstruction from count data in real-world scenarios.

### DDPS: Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Paths in Layered Graphs
**Authors**: Hao Luan, See-Kiong Ng, Chun Kai Ling

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:34:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models form an important class of generative models today, accounting for much of the state of the art in cutting edge AI research. While numerous extensions beyond image and video generation exist, few of such approaches address the issue of explicit constraints in the samples generated. In this paper, we study the problem of generating paths in a layered graph (a variant of a directed acyclic graph) using discrete diffusion models, while guaranteeing that our generated samples are indeed paths. Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective representation for paths which we call the padded adjacency-list matrix (PALM). In addition, we show how to effectively perform classifier guidance, which helps steer the sampled paths to specific preferred edges without any retraining of the diffusion model. Our preliminary results show that empirically, our method outperforms alternatives which do not explicitly account for path constraints.

### Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop   Reasoning with Transformers
**Authors**: Roman Abramov, Felix Steinbauer, Gjergji Kasneci

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:33:29Z

**Summary**: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

### Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Global Planning and Hierarchical   Execution
**Authors**: Junjie Chen, Haitao Li, Jingli Yang, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:30:20Z

**Summary**: Intelligent agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in real-world applications. However, existing agent frameworks still face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting their effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning methods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local branches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution mechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited action space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that introduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a hierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into high-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby reducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across diverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark with multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of tools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate. These findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more advanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex real-world applications. Our code can be found at https://github.com/cjj826/GoalAct.

### DB-GNN: Dual-Branch Graph Neural Network with Multi-Level Contrastive   Learning for Jointly Identifying Within- and Cross-Frequency Coupled Brain   Networks
**Authors**: Xiang Wang, Hui Xu, Jing Cai, Ta Zhou, Xibei Yang, Wei Xue

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:24:37Z

**Summary**: Within-frequency coupling (WFC) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in brain networks reflect neural synchronization within the same frequency band and cross-band oscillatory interactions, respectively. Their synergy provides a comprehensive understanding of neural mechanisms underlying cognitive states such as emotion. However, existing multi-channel EEG studies often analyze WFC or CFC separately, failing to fully leverage their complementary properties. This study proposes a dual-branch graph neural network (DB-GNN) to jointly identify within- and cross-frequency coupled brain networks. Firstly, DBGNN leverages its unique dual-branch learning architecture to efficiently mine global collaborative information and local cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling information. Secondly, to more fully perceive the global information of cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling, the global perception branch of DB-GNN adopts a Transformer architecture. To prevent overfitting of the Transformer architecture, this study integrates prior within- and cross-frequency coupling information into the Transformer inference process, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of DB-GNN. Finally, a multi-scale graph contrastive learning regularization term is introduced to constrain the global and local perception branches of DB-GNN at both graph-level and node-level, enhancing its joint perception ability and further improving its generalization performance. Experimental validation on the emotion recognition dataset shows that DB-GNN achieves a testing accuracy of 97.88% and an F1- score of 97.87%, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

### Bayesian Inference in Quantum Programs
**Authors**: Christina Gehnen, Dominique Unruh, Joost-Pieter Katoen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:15:54Z

**Summary**: Conditioning is a key feature in probabilistic programming to enable modeling the influence of data (also known as observations) to the probability distribution described by such programs. Determining the posterior distribution is also known as Bayesian inference. This paper equips a quantum while-language with conditioning, defines its denotational and operational semantics over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and shows their equivalence. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of weakest (liberal) precondition-transformers and derive inductive characterizations of these transformers. It is shown how w(l)p-transformers can be used to assess the effect of Bayesian inference on (possibly diverging) quantum programs.

### AlphaFuse: Learn ID Embeddings for Sequential Recommendation in Null   Space of Language Embeddings
**Authors**: Guoqing Hu, An Zhang, Shuo Liu, Zhibo Cai, Xun Yang, Xiang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:59:17Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in sequential recommendation have underscored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing item embeddings. However, existing approaches face three key limitations: 1) the degradation of the semantic space when high-dimensional language embeddings are mapped to lower-dimensional ID embeddings, 2) the underutilization of language embeddings, and 3) the reliance on additional trainable parameters, such as an adapter, to bridge the gap between the semantic and behavior spaces. In this paper, we introduce AlphaFuse, a simple but effective language-guided learning strategy that addresses these challenges by learning ID embeddings within the null space of language embeddings. Specifically, we decompose the semantic space of language embeddings via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), distinguishing it into a semantic-rich row space and a semantic-sparse null space. Collaborative signals are then injected into the null space, while preserving the rich semantics of the row space. AlphaFuse prevents degradation of the semantic space, integrates the retained language embeddings into the final item embeddings, and eliminates the need for auxiliary trainable modules, enabling seamless adaptation to any sequential recommendation framework. We validate the effectiveness and flexibility of AlphaFuse through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including cold-start user and long-tail settings, showcasing significant improvements in both discriminative and diffusion-based generative sequential recommenders. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Hugo-Chinn/AlphaFuse.

### FLIMFLAM DR1: The First Constraints on the Cosmic Baryon Distribution   from 8 FRB sightlines

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:58:23Z

**Summary**: The dispersion measure of fast radio bursts (FRBs), arising from the interactions of the pulses with free electrons along the propagation path, constitutes a unique probe of the cosmic baryon distribution. Their constraining power is further enhanced in combination with observations of the foreground large-scale structure and intervening galaxies. In this work, we present the first constraints on the partition of the cosmic baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), inferred from the FLIMFLAM spectroscopic survey. In its first data release, the FLIMFLAM survey targeted galaxies in the foreground of 8 localized FRBs. Using Bayesian techniques, we reconstruct the underlying ~Mpc-scale matter density field that is traced by the IGM gas. Simultaneously, deeper spectroscopy of intervening foreground galaxies (at impact parameters $b_\perp \lesssim r_{200}$) and the FRB host galaxies constrains the contribution from the CGM. Applying Bayesian parameter inference to our data and assuming a fiducial set of priors, we infer the IGM cosmic baryon fraction to be $f_{\rm igm}=0.59^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$, and a CGM gas fraction of $f_{\rm gas} = 0.55^{+0.26}_{-0.29}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm halo}\lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$ halos. The mean FRB host dispersion measure (rest-frame) in our sample is $\langle \rm{DM_{host}}\rangle = 90^{+29}_{-19}\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, of which $\langle{\rm DM_{host}^{unk}}\rangle =69^{+28}_{-19}~\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ arises from the host galaxy ISM and/or the FRB progenitor environment. While our current $f_{\rm igm}$ and $f_{\rm gas}$ uncertainties are too broad to constrain most galactic feedback models, this result marks the first measurement of the IGM and CGM baryon fractions, as well as the first systematic separation of the FRB host dispersion measure into two components: arising from the halo and from the inner ISM/FRB engine.

**Authors**: Thomas Pickard, Aline Villavicencio, Maggie Mi, Wei He, Dylan Phelps, Marco Idiart

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:42:33Z

**Summary**: Idiomatic expressions present a unique challenge in NLP, as their meanings are often not directly inferable from their constituent words. Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence. The most effective methods achieved human-level performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs and vision-language models in mixture-of-experts settings, with multiple queries used to smooth over the weaknesses in these models' representations of idiomaticity.

### Beyond the Last Answer: Your Reasoning Trace Uncovers More than You   Think
**Authors**: Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Hani Itani, Bernard Ghanem

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:39:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning trace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its conclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by posing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent the model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different results? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps, termed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach involves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on linguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from the end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer from every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We find that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the mode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on the answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency among the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics that correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting potential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various LLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025) show consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\% and 10\% respectively.

### Trustworthiness of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Distributed Learning
**Authors**: Hongyang Li, Caesar Wu, Mohammed Chadli, Said Mammar, Pascal Bouvry

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:30:32Z

**Summary**: Distributed learning (DL) uses multiple nodes to accelerate training, enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a key optimization algorithm, plays a central role in this process. However, communication bottlenecks often limit scalability and efficiency, leading to increasing adoption of compressed SGD techniques to alleviate these challenges. Despite addressing communication overheads, compressed SGD introduces trustworthiness concerns, as gradient exchanges among nodes are vulnerable to attacks like gradient inversion (GradInv) and membership inference attacks (MIA). The trustworthiness of compressed SGD remains unexplored, leaving important questions about its reliability unanswered.   In this paper, we provide a trustworthiness evaluation of compressed versus uncompressed SGD. Specifically, we conducted empirical studies using GradInv attacks, revealing that compressed SGD demonstrates significantly higher resistance to privacy leakage compared to uncompressed SGD. In addition, our findings suggest that MIA may not be a reliable metric for assessing privacy risks in distributed learning.

**Authors**: Evangelia Gogoulou, Shorouq Zahra, Liane Guillou, Luise Dürlich, Joakim Nivre

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:30:05Z

**Summary**: A frequently observed problem with LLMs is their tendency to generate output that is nonsensical, illogical, or factually incorrect, often referred to broadly as hallucination. Building on the recently proposed HalluciGen task for hallucination detection and generation, we evaluate a suite of open-access LLMs on their ability to detect intrinsic hallucinations in two conditional generation tasks: translation and paraphrasing. We study how model performance varies across tasks and language and we investigate the impact of model size, instruction tuning, and prompt choice. We find that performance varies across models but is consistent across prompts. Finally, we find that NLI models perform comparably well, suggesting that LLM-based detectors are not the only viable option for this specific task.

### WR + O binaries as probes of the first phase of mass transfer
**Authors**: Marit Nuijten, Gijs Nelemans

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:16:58Z

**Summary**: Context. Wolf-Rayet (WR) and O-star binaries can be the progenitors of X-ray binaries and double black hole binaries. Their formation is not yet fully understood, however. For 21 observed WR+O systems, we aim to infer whether the mass transfer started on the main sequence (Case A) or later (Case B). We also calculated (limits on) the mass-transfer efficiency {\beta}, that is, the fraction of transferred mass that is accreted, and the parameter {\gamma}, which denotes the fraction of angular momentum of the binary that is lost per unit mass in units of the average angular momentum of the binary per unit mass. Aims. We inferred the possible values for the initial masses based on the observed WR masses and models for WR from the literature. With these initial primary masses, we created a grid of possible periods and secondary masses for which we determined the values that {\beta} and {\gamma} would have taken for either Case A or Case B mass transfer. Based on this, we also determined the case of mass transfer that is most likely for each system. Methods. Taking into account the progenitor distribution of WR+O binaries, we find that highly non-conservative Case A mass transfer seems to be the most likely scenario for the majority of systems as this can explain 14 out of 21 systems. The angular momentum loss is likely relatively high (typically {\gamma} > 1). Our finding that most systems in our sample experienced Case A mass transfer contradicts the expectation that most massive binaries go through Case B mass transfer. This suggests that post-case-B systems are significantly underrepresented in the observed WR+O binary population, either intrinsically or due to severe selection effects.

### In-Context Edit: Enabling Instructional Image Editing with In-Context   Generation in Large Scale Diffusion Transformer
**Authors**: Zechuan Zhang, Ji Xie, Yu Lu, Zongxin Yang, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:14:47Z

**Summary**: Instruction-based image editing enables robust image modification via natural language prompts, yet current methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff. Fine-tuning methods demand significant computational resources and large datasets, while training-free techniques struggle with instruction comprehension and edit quality. We resolve this dilemma by leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformer (DiT)' enhanced generation capacity and native contextual awareness. Our solution introduces three contributions: (1) an in-context editing framework for zero-shot instruction compliance using in-context prompting, avoiding structural changes; (2) a LoRA-MoE hybrid tuning strategy that enhances flexibility with efficient adaptation and dynamic expert routing, without extensive retraining; and (3) an early filter inference-time scaling method using vision-language models (VLMs) to select better initial noise early, improving edit quality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superiority: it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring only 0.5% training data and 1% trainable parameters compared to conventional baselines. This work establishes a new paradigm that enables high-precision yet efficient instruction-guided editing. Codes and demos can be found in https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/.

### Inference of high-dimensional weak instrumental variable regression   models without ridge-regularization
**Authors**: Jiarong Ding, Xu Guo, Yanmei Shi, Yuxin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:10:26Z

**Summary**: Inference of instrumental variable regression models with many weak instruments attracts many attentions recently. To extend the classical Anderson-Rubin test to high-dimensional setting, many procedures adopt ridge-regularization. However, we show that it is not necessary to consider ridge-regularization. Actually we propose a new quadratic-type test statistic which does not involve tuning parameters. Our quadratic-type test exhibits high power against dense alternatives. While for sparse alternatives, we derive the asymptotic distribution of an existing maximum-type test, enabling the use of less conservative critical values. To achieve strong performance across a wide range of scenarios, we further introduce a combined test procedure that integrates the strengths of both approaches. This combined procedure is powerful without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying sparsity of the first-stage model. Compared to existing methods, our proposed tests are easy to implement, free of tuning parameters, and robust to arbitrarily weak instruments as well as heteroskedastic errors. Simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrate the advantages of our methods over existing approaches.

**Authors**: Hassan Sartaj, Jalil Boudjadar, Mirgita Frasheri, Shaukat Ali, Peter Gorm Larsen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:07:39Z

**Summary**: Future self-adaptive robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments while effectively managing uncertainties. However, identifying the sources and impacts of uncertainties in such robotic systems and defining appropriate mitigation strategies is challenging due to the inherent complexity of self-adaptive robots and the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the various factors influencing uncertainty. Hence, practitioners often rely on intuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties. In this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle. For this evaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four industrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners' perspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties. Results showed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed strong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose.

### Doxing via the Lens: Revealing Privacy Leakage in Image Geolocation for   Agentic Multi-Modal Large Reasoning Model
**Authors**: Weidi Luo, Qiming Zhang, Tianyu Lu, Xiaogeng Liu, Yue Zhao, Zhen Xiang, Chaowei Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:00:08Z

**Summary**: The increasing capabilities of agentic multi-modal large reasoning models, such as ChatGPT o3, have raised critical concerns regarding privacy leakage through inadvertent image geolocation. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic and controlled study on the potential privacy risks associated with visual reasoning abilities of ChatGPT o3. We manually collect and construct a dataset comprising 50 real-world images that feature individuals alongside privacy-relevant environmental elements, capturing realistic and sensitive scenarios for analysis. Our experimental evaluation reveals that ChatGPT o3 can predict user locations with high precision, achieving street-level accuracy (within one mile) in 60% of cases. Through analysis, we identify key visual cues, including street layout and front yard design, that significantly contribute to the model inference success. Additionally, targeted occlusion experiments demonstrate that masking critical features effectively mitigates geolocation accuracy, providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. Our findings highlight an urgent need for privacy-aware development for agentic multi-modal large reasoning models, particularly in applications involving private imagery.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:57:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in software engineering, excelling in tasks like code generation and maintenance. However, existing benchmarks are often narrow in scope, focusing on a specific task and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework that reflects real-world applications. To address these gaps, we introduce CoCo-Bench (Comprehensive Code Benchmark), designed to evaluate LLMs across four critical dimensions: code understanding, code generation, code modification, and code review. These dimensions capture essential developer needs, ensuring a more systematic and representative evaluation. CoCo-Bench includes multiple programming languages and varying task difficulties, with rigorous manual review to ensure data quality and accuracy. Empirical results show that CoCo-Bench aligns with existing benchmarks while uncovering significant variations in model performance, effectively highlighting strengths and weaknesses. By offering a holistic and objective evaluation, CoCo-Bench provides valuable insights to guide future research and technological advancements in code-oriented LLMs, establishing a reliable benchmark for the field.

### Two-stage deep learning framework for the restoration of incomplete-ring   PET images
**Authors**: Yeqi Fang, Rong Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:57:11Z

**Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging tool widely used in medicine. Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.

### A Generative-AI-Driven Claim Retrieval System Capable of Detecting and   Retrieving Claims from Social Media Platforms in Multiple Languages
**Authors**: Ivan Vykopal, Martin Hyben, Robert Moro, Michal Gregor, Jakub Simko

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:49:05Z

**Summary**: Online disinformation poses a global challenge, placing significant demands on fact-checkers who must verify claims efficiently to prevent the spread of false information. A major issue in this process is the redundant verification of already fact-checked claims, which increases workload and delays responses to newly emerging claims. This research introduces an approach that retrieves previously fact-checked claims, evaluates their relevance to a given input, and provides supplementary information to support fact-checkers. Our method employs large language models (LLMs) to filter irrelevant fact-checks and generate concise summaries and explanations, enabling fact-checkers to faster assess whether a claim has been verified before. In addition, we evaluate our approach through both automatic and human assessments, where humans interact with the developed tool to review its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that LLMs are able to filter out many irrelevant fact-checks and, therefore, reduce effort and streamline the fact-checking process.

### DP-2Stage: Adapting Language Models as Differentially Private Tabular   Data Generators
**Authors**: Tejumade Afonja, Hui-Po Wang, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:33:25Z

**Summary**: Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose DP-2Stage, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.

### ComplexVCoder: An LLM-Driven Framework for Systematic Generation of   Complex Verilog Code
**Authors**: Jian Zuo, Junzhe Liu, Xianyong Wang, Yicheng Liu, Navya Goli, Tong Xu, Hao Zhang, Umamaheswara Rao Tida, Zhenge Jia, Mengying Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:22:06Z

**Summary**: Recent advances have demonstrated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.

### Combatting Dimensional Collapse in LLM Pre-Training Data via Diversified   File Selection
**Authors**: Ziqing Fan, Siyuan Du, Shengchao Hu, Pingjie Wang, Li Shen, Ya Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Yanfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:13:18Z

**Summary**: Selecting high-quality pre-training data for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their overall performance under limited computation budget, improving both training and sample efficiency. Recent advancements in file selection primarily rely on using an existing or trained proxy model to assess the similarity of samples to a target domain, such as high quality sources BookCorpus and Wikipedia. However, upon revisiting these methods, the domain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma, i.e.dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the domain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance. To prevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection algorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature space. We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more uniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts, analyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of $\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a benchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with models from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the Harness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall performance. Specifically, DiSF saves 98.5% of 590M training files in SlimPajama, outperforming the full-data pre-training within a 50B training budget, and achieving about 1.5x training efficiency and 5x data efficiency.

### Cooking Up Creativity: A Cognitively-Inspired Approach for Enhancing LLM   Creativity through Structured Representations
**Authors**: Moran Mizrahi, Chen Shani, Gabriel Stanovsky, Dan Jurafsky, Dafna Shahaf

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:13:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at countless tasks, yet struggle with creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with structured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate more creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured representations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively explore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater diversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

### \$PINN -- a Domain Decomposition Method for Bayesian Physics-Informed   Neural Networks
**Authors**: Júlia Vicens Figueres, Juliette Vanderhaeghen, Federica Bragone, Kateryna Morozovska, Khemraj Shukla

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:00:53Z

**Summary**: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.

### A spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model for imaging   genetics
**Authors**: Zhibin Pu, Shufei Ge

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:00:46Z

**Summary**: Imaging genetics aims to uncover the hidden relationship between imaging quantitative traits (QTs) and genetic markers (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), and brings valuable insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as cancers and cognitive disorders (e.g. the Alzheimer's Disease). However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly model the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential efficiency gains from information borrowing across brain regions. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant associations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modeling spatial dependency between QTs, with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we developed a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to account for dependencies between QTs. We incorporated a population-level mixed effects term into the model, taking full advantage of the dependent structure of brain imaging-derived QTs. Secondly, we implemented the model in the Bayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to achieve the model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the Cauchy combination test (CCT) to examine the association between SNPs and QTs, which avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation studies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic models where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled. We also applied the new spatial model to an imaging dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

### Cognitive maps are generative programs
**Authors**: Marta Kryven, Cole Wyeth, Aidan Curtis, Kevin Ellis

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:55:40Z

**Summary**: Making sense of the world and acting in it relies on building simplified mental representations that abstract away aspects of reality. This principle of cognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living organisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional representations of their world under various computing constraints. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may arise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the metaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the form of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in contrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment to show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning strategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a computational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured scenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic cognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this distribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large Language Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through training on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms unstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human behavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic cognitive maps.

### PaRT: Enhancing Proactive Social Chatbots with Personalized Real-Time   Retrieval
**Authors**: Zihan Niu, Zheyong Xie, Shaosheng Cao, Chonggang Lu, Zheyu Ye, Tong Xu, Zuozhu Liu, Yan Gao, Jia Chen, Zhe Xu, Yi Wu, Yao Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:51:58Z

**Summary**: Social chatbots have become essential intelligent companions in daily scenarios ranging from emotional support to personal interaction. However, conventional chatbots with passive response mechanisms usually rely on users to initiate or sustain dialogues by bringing up new topics, resulting in diminished engagement and shortened dialogue duration. In this paper, we present PaRT, a novel framework enabling context-aware proactive dialogues for social chatbots through personalized real-time retrieval and generation. Specifically, PaRT first integrates user profiles and dialogue context into a large language model (LLM), which is initially prompted to refine user queries and recognize their underlying intents for the upcoming conversation. Guided by refined intents, the LLM generates personalized dialogue topics, which then serve as targeted queries to retrieve relevant passages from RedNote. Finally, we prompt LLMs with summarized passages to generate knowledge-grounded and engagement-optimized responses. Our approach has been running stably in a real-world production environment for more than 30 days, achieving a 21.77\% improvement in the average duration of dialogues.

### Predicate Debiasing in Vision-Language Models Integration for Scene   Graph Generation Enhancement
**Authors**: Yuxuan Wang, Xiaoyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:39:35Z

**Summary**: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) provides basic language representation of visual scenes, requiring models to grasp complex and diverse semantics between objects. This complexity and diversity in SGG leads to underrepresentation, where parts of triplet labels are rare or even unseen during training, resulting in imprecise predictions. To tackle this, we propose integrating the pretrained Vision-language Models to enhance representation. However, due to the gap between pretraining and SGG, direct inference of pretrained VLMs on SGG leads to severe bias, which stems from the imbalanced predicates distribution in the pretraining language set. To alleviate the bias, we introduce a novel LM Estimation to approximate the unattainable predicates distribution. Finally, we ensemble the debiased VLMs with SGG models to enhance the representation, where we design a certainty-aware indicator to score each sample and dynamically adjust the ensemble weights. Our training-free method effectively addresses the predicates bias in pretrained VLMs, enhances SGG's representation, and significantly improve the performance.

### The Hidden Risks of LLM-Generated Web Application Code: A   Security-Centric Evaluation of Code Generation Capabilities in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Swaroop Dora, Deven Lunkad, Naziya Aslam, S. Venkatesan, Sandeep Kumar Shukla

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:23:11Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enhanced software development processes, minimizing the time and effort required for coding and enhancing developer productivity. However, despite their potential benefits, code generated by LLMs has been shown to generate insecure code in controlled environments, raising critical concerns about their reliability and security in real-world applications. This paper uses predefined security parameters to evaluate the security compliance of LLM-generated code across multiple models, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini and Grok. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, session management, input validation and HTTP security headers. Although some models implement security measures to a limited extent, none fully align with industry best practices, highlighting the associated risks in automated software development. Our findings underscore that human expertise is crucial to ensure secure software deployment or review of LLM-generated code. Also, there is a need for robust security assessment frameworks to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated code in real-world applications.

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.

**Authors**: Xinyu Yao, Mengdi Wang, Bo Chen, Xiaobing Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:19:05Z

**Summary**: Classical Chinese, as the core carrier of Chinese culture, plays a crucial role in the inheritance and study of ancient literature. However, existing natural language processing models primarily optimize for Modern Chinese, resulting in inadequate performance on Classical Chinese. This paper presents a comprehensive solution for Classical Chinese language processing. By continuing pre-training and instruction fine-tuning on the LLaMA3-8B-Chinese model, we construct a large language model, WenyanGPT, which is specifically designed for Classical Chinese tasks. Additionally, we develop an evaluation benchmark dataset, WenyanBENCH. Experimental results on WenyanBENCH demonstrate that WenyanGPT significantly outperforms current advanced LLMs in various Classical Chinese tasks. We make the model's training data, instruction fine-tuning data\footnote, and evaluation benchmark dataset publicly available to promote further research and development in the field of Classical Chinese processing.

**Authors**: Jiwoo Kim, Joonhyung Lee, Gunho Park, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee, Youngjoo Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:17:15Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their inference demands present significant challenges, particularly due to the high power consumption of AI accelerators in datacenters. These facilities require specialized cooling and power management systems, substantially increasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers (CSPs). In this work, we analyze the computational characteristics and constraints of LLM inference from a TCO perspective, focusing on two representative accelerators: the Gaudi 2 and NVIDIA H100. We present a generalizable framework that enables CSPs to compare and select AI accelerators according to diverse operational requirements. Using this model, we analyze the impact of FP8 precision and LLM inference workload characteristics as key factors influencing TCO. We investigate FP8 quantization, which is gaining adoption in LLM training, as a technique to improve inference throughput while maintaining cost efficiency. Furthermore, our analysis of LLM inference workloads reveals that performance on thin GEMMs, which dominate the decode phase, can have a greater impact than theoretical hardware peak performance. By studying the interaction between power consumption, quantization strategies, and hardware architecture, we offer insights that support informed deployment decisions and guide future accelerator designs to improve the TCO of LLM inference.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:54:32Z

**Summary**: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.

### ReasonIR: Training Retrievers for Reasoning Tasks
**Authors**: Rulin Shao, Rui Qiao, Varsha Kishore, Niklas Muennighoff, Xi Victoria Lin, Daniela Rus, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Sewon Min, Wen-tau Yih, Pang Wei Koh, Luke Zettlemoyer

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:49:28Z

**Summary**: We present ReasonIR-8B, the first retriever specifically trained for general reasoning tasks. Existing retrievers have shown limited gains on reasoning tasks, in part because existing training datasets focus on short factual queries tied to documents that straightforwardly answer them. We develop a synthetic data generation pipeline that, for each document, our pipeline creates a challenging and relevant query, along with a plausibly related but ultimately unhelpful hard negative. By training on a mixture of our synthetic data and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a widely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When applied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4% and 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming other retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time compute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases with longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to outperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker. Our training recipe is general and can be easily extended to future LLMs; to this end, we open-source our code, data, and model.

### Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One   Training Example
**Authors**: Yiping Wang, Qing Yang, Zhiyuan Zeng, Liliang Ren, Lucas Liu, Baolin Peng, Hao Cheng, Xuehai He, Kuan Wang, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen, Shuohang Wang, Simon Shaolei Du, Yelong Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:24:30Z

**Summary**: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

### Specification Mining for Smart Contracts with Trace Slicing and   Predicate Abstraction
**Authors**: Ye Liu, Yixuan Liu, Yi Li, Cyrille Artho

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:23:40Z

**Summary**: Smart contracts are computer programs running on blockchains to implement Decentralized Applications. The absence of contract specifications hinders routine tasks, such as contract understanding and testing. In this work, we propose a specification mining approach to infer contract specifications from past transaction histories. Our approach derives high-level behavioral automata of function invocations, accompanied by program invariants statistically inferred from the transaction histories. We implemented our approach as tool SMCON and evaluated it on eleven well-studied Azure benchmark smart contracts and six popular real-world DApp smart contracts. The experiments show that SMCON mines reasonably accurate specifications that can be used to enhance symbolic analysis of smart contracts achieving higher code coverage and up to 56% speedup, and facilitate DApp developers in maintaining high-quality documentation and test suites.

### ReCIT: Reconstructing Full Private Data from Gradient in   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jin Xie, Ruishi He, Songze Li, Xiaojun Jia, Shouling Ji

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:23:19Z

**Summary**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical solution for adapting large language models (LLMs) to custom datasets with significantly reduced computational cost. When carrying out PEFT under collaborative learning scenarios (e.g., federated learning), it is often required to exchange model updates (or gradients) across parties. These gradients, even with limited dimensions, can cause severe breach of data privacy. Recent works have shown that both contextual prefixes and personally identifiable information (PII) can be exposed through gradients. However, \emph{simultaneously} and \emph{accurately} recovering both components from the same training instance remains infeasible due to the following challenges: 1) limited number of PEFT parameters; 2) high-dimensional token spaces; and 3) large batch sizes. We propose ReCIT, a novel privacy attack that addresses all challenges, and achieves recovery of \emph{full} private data from PEFT gradients with high fidelity. Specifically, ReCIT proposes to enhance the memorization capability of the pre-trained model through malicious fine-tuning with Personal Notes; ReCIT also proposes a novel filter-based token extraction technique and a token pairing mechanism, to accurately reconstruct tokens from the training sequences with large batch sizes. Extensive evaluations show that ReCIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art gradient inversion and memorization-based attacks across different PEFT paradigms. It achieves up to 10$\times$ higher PII recovery rates and remains effective across varying batch sizes, especially in settings where prefix reconstruction is intractable for conventional approaches. These findings highlight an urgent need to reassess the privacy guarantees of PEFT, especially in decentralized or shared training environments.

### Leveraging Memory Retrieval to Enhance LLM-based Generative   Recommendation
**Authors**: Chengbing Wang, Yang Zhang, Fengbin Zhu, Jizhi Zhang, Tianhao Shi, Fuli Feng

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:21:08Z

**Summary**: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to harness user-item interaction histories for item generation has emerged as a promising paradigm in generative recommendation. However, the limited context window of LLMs often restricts them to focusing on recent user interactions only, leading to the neglect of long-term interests involved in the longer histories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Automatic Memory-Retrieval framework (AutoMR), which is capable of storing long-term interests in the memory and extracting relevant information from it for next-item generation within LLMs. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AutoMR framework in utilizing long-term interests for generative recommendation.

### When Knockoffs fail: diagnosing and fixing non-exchangeability of   Knockoffs
**Authors**: Alexandre Blain, Angel Reyero Lobo, Julia Linhart, Bertrand Thirion, Pierre Neuvial

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:57:04Z

**Summary**: Knockoffs are a popular statistical framework that addresses the challenging problem of conditional variable selection in high-dimensional settings with statistical control. Such statistical control is essential for the reliability of inference. However, knockoff guarantees rely on an exchangeability assumption that is difficult to test in practice, and there is little discussion in the literature on how to deal with unfulfilled hypotheses. This assumption is related to the ability to generate data similar to the observed data. To maintain reliable inference, we introduce a diagnostic tool based on Classifier Two-Sample Tests. Using simulations and real data, we show that violations of this assumption occur in common settings for classical knockoff generators, especially when the data have a strong dependence structure. As a consequence, knockoff-based inference suffers from a massive inflation of false positives. We show that the diagnostic tool correctly detects such behavior. We show that an alternative knockoff construction, based on constructing a predictor of each variable based on all others, solves the issue. We also propose a computationally-efficient variant of this algorithm and show empirically that this approach restores error control on simulated data and semi-simulated experiments based on neuroimaging data.

### Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of   energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic   inference
**Authors**: Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:56:49Z

**Summary**: It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.

### A Deep Generative Model for Five-Class Sleep Staging with Arbitrary   Sensor Input
**Authors**: Hans van Gorp, Merel M. van Gilst, Pedro Fonseca, Fokke B. van Meulen, Johannes P. van Dijk, Sebastiaan Overeem, Ruud J. G. van Sloun

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:51:57Z

**Summary**: Gold-standard sleep scoring is based on epoch-based assignment of sleep stages based on a combination of EEG, EOG and EMG signals. However, a polysomnographic recording consists of many other signals that could be used for sleep staging, including cardio-respiratory modalities. Leveraging this signal variety would offer important advantages, for example increasing reliability, resilience to signal loss, and application to long-term non-obtrusive recordings. We developed a deep generative model for automatic sleep staging from a plurality of sensors and any -- arbitrary -- combination thereof. We trained a score-based diffusion model using a dataset of 1947 expert-labelled overnight recordings with 36 different signals, and achieved zero-shot inference on any sensor set by leveraging a novel Bayesian factorization of the score function across the sensors. On single-channel EEG, the model reaches the performance limit in terms of polysomnography inter-rater agreement (5-class accuracy 85.6%, Cohen's kappa 0.791). Moreover, the method offers full flexibility to use any sensor set, for example finger photoplethysmography, nasal flow and thoracic respiratory movements, (5-class accuracy 79.0%, Cohen's kappa of 0.697), or even derivations very unconventional for sleep staging, such as tibialis and sternocleidomastoid EMG (5-class accuracy 71.0%, kappa 0.575). Additionally, we propose a novel interpretability metric in terms of information gain per sensor and show this is linearly correlated with classification performance. Finally, our model allows for post-hoc addition of entirely new sensor modalities by merely training a score estimator on the novel input instead of having to retrain from scratch on all inputs.

### Revisiting the MIMIC-IV Benchmark: Experiments Using Language Models for   Electronic Health Records
**Authors**: Jesus Lovon, Thouria Ben-Haddi, Jules Di Scala, Jose G. Moreno, Lynda Tamine

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:49:38Z

**Summary**: The lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks in the medical domain for text inputs can be a barrier to widely adopting and leveraging the potential of natural language models for health-related downstream tasks. This paper revisited an openly available MIMIC-IV benchmark for electronic health records (EHRs) to address this issue. First, we integrate the MIMIC-IV data within the Hugging Face datasets library to allow an easy share and use of this collection. Second, we investigate the application of templates to convert EHR tabular data to text. Experiments using fine-tuned and zero-shot LLMs on the mortality of patients task show that fine-tuned text-based models are competitive against robust tabular classifiers. In contrast, zero-shot LLMs struggle to leverage EHR representations. This study underlines the potential of text-based approaches in the medical field and highlights areas for further improvement.

### Efficiency Unleashed: Inference Acceleration for LLM-based Recommender   Systems with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Yunjia Xi, Hangyu Wang, Bo Chen, Jianghao Lin, Menghui Zhu, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang, Zhewei Wei, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:43:15Z

**Summary**: The past few years have witnessed a growing interest in LLM-based recommender systems (RSs), although their industrial deployment remains in a preliminary stage. Most existing deployments leverage LLMs offline as feature enhancers, generating augmented knowledge for downstream tasks. However, in recommendation scenarios with numerous users and items, even offline knowledge generation with LLMs demands significant time and computational resources. This inefficiency arises from the autoregressive nature of LLMs. A promising solution is speculative decoding, a Draft-Then-Verify approach that increases the number of tokens generated per decoding step. In this work, we first identify recommendation knowledge generation as a highly fitting use case for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern its two characteristics: (1) the vast number of items and users in RSs leads to retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for LLM-generated text. Building on these insights, we introduce Lossless Acceleration via Speculative Decoding for LLM-based Recommender Systems (LASER), which features a Customized Retrieval Pool to enhance retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to improve the acceptance rate of draft tokens. LASER achieves a 3-5x speedup on public datasets and saves about 67\% of computational resources during the online A/B test on a large-scale advertising scenario with lossless downstream recommendation performance.

### The FLAMINGO project: Baryon effects on the matter power spectrum
**Authors**: Matthieu Schaller, Joop Schaye, Roi Kugel, Jeger C. Broxterman, Marcel P. van Daalen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:27:08Z

**Summary**: The effect of baryon physics associated with galaxy formation onto the large-scale matter distribution of the Universe is a key uncertainty in the theoretical modelling required for the interpretation of Stage IV surveys. We use the FLAMINGO simulations to study the baryon response due to galaxy formation of the total matter power spectrum. We find that it is only well converged for simulation volumes in excess of $200^3$ Mpc$^3$. We report results for simulations of varying feedback intensity, which either match the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters and the $z=0$ stellar mass function, or shifted versions of the data, as well as for different implementations of AGN feedback. We package our results in the form of a Gaussian process emulator which can rapidly reproduce all the simulations' predictions to better than one per cent up to the comoving wavenumber $k = 10~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and up to $z=3$ for all the feedback models present in the FLAMINGO suite. We find that the response becomes stronger, the range of scales affected increases, and the position of the minimum of the response moves to smaller scales as the redshift decreases. We find that lower gas fractions in groups and clusters lead to a stronger response and that the use of collimated jets instead of thermally driven winds for AGN feedback enhances the effect. Lowering the stellar masses at fixed cluster gas fractions also increases the magnitude of the response. We find only a small (1% at $k<10~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$) dependence of our results on the background cosmology, but a wider range of cosmology variations will be needed to confirm this result. The response we obtain for our strongest feedback models is compatible with some of the recent analyses combining weak lensing with external data. Such a response is, however, in strong tension with the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters used to calibrate the FLAMINGO model.

### Safe to Stay: Psychological Safety Sustains Participation in Pull-based   Open Source Projects
**Authors**: Emeralda Sesari, Federica Sarro, Ayushi Rastogi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:21:19Z

**Summary**: Background: Psychological safety refers to the belief that team members can speak up or make mistakes without fear of negative consequences. While it is recognized as important in traditional software teams, its role in open-source software development remains understudied. Open-source contributors often collaborate without formal roles or structures, where interpersonal relationships can significantly influence participation. Code review, a central and collaborative activity in modern software development, offers a valuable context for observing such team interactions. Aims: This study investigates whether team-level psychological safety, inferred from code review activities, is associated with contributors' sustained participation in open-source projects. Method: Using data from 60,684 pull requests across multiple repositories, we developed a psychological safety index based on observable cues such as merge decisions, comment activity, interaction diversity, and mentions. We analyzed the relationship between this index and contributors' short-term (within 1 year) and long-term (over 4--5 years) sustained participation using three logistic regression models. Results: Contributors are more likely to remain active in repositories with higher levels of psychological safety. Psychological safety is positively associated with both short-term and long-term sustained participation. However, prior participation emerges as a stronger predictor of future engagement, reducing the effect of psychological safety when accounted for. Conclusions: This study introduces a scalable, data-driven approach to measuring psychological safety through pull request data and provides new empirical evidence of its relevance in sustaining participation within open-source development.

### Conversations with AI Chatbots Increase Short-Term Vaccine Intentions   But Do Not Outperform Standard Public Health Messaging
**Authors**: Neil K. R. Sehgal, Sunny Rai, Manuel Tonneau, Anish K. Agarwal, Joseph Cappella, Melanie Kornides, Lyle Ungar, Alison Buttenheim, Sharath Chandra Guntuku

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T03:22:51Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.

### Fast, Accurate and Perturbative Forward Modeling of Galaxy Clustering   Part I: Galaxies in the Restframe
**Authors**: Julia Stadler, Fabian Schmidt, Martin Reinecke

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:58:55Z

**Summary**: Forward models of the galaxy density field enable simulation based inference as well as field level inference of galaxy clustering. However, these analysis techniques require forward models that are both computationally fast and robust to modeling uncertainties in the relation between galaxies and matter. Both requirements can be addressed with the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure. Here, we focus on the physical and numerical convergence of the LEFTfield model. Based on the perturbative nature of the forward model, we derive an analytic understanding of the leading numerical errors, and we compare our estimates to high-resolution and N-body references. This allows us to derive a set of best-practice recommendations for the numerical accuracy parameters, which are completely specified by the desired order of the perturbative solution and the cut-off scale. We verify these recommendations by an extended set of parameter recovery tests from fully nonlinear mock data and find very consistent results. A single evaluation of the forward model takes seconds, making cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering data based on forward models computationally feasible.

### Detecting Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder based on Script-Centric   Behavior Understanding with Emotional Enhancement
**Authors**: Wenxing Liu, Yueran Pan, Dong Zhang, Hongzhu Deng, Xiaobing Zou, Ming Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:46:18Z

**Summary**: The early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critically dependent on systematic observation and analysis of children's social behaviors. While current methodologies predominantly utilize supervised learning approaches, their clinical adoption faces two principal limitations: insufficient ASD diagnostic samples and inadequate interpretability of the detection outcomes. This paper presents a novel zero-shot ASD detection framework based on script-centric behavioral understanding with emotional enhancement, which is designed to overcome the aforementioned clinical constraints. The proposed pipeline automatically converts audio-visual data into structured behavioral text scripts through computer vision techniques, subsequently capitalizing on the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot/few-shot ASD detection. Three core technical contributions are introduced: (1) A multimodal script transcription module transforming behavioral cues into structured textual representations. (2) An emotion textualization module encoding emotional dynamics as the contextual features to augment behavioral understanding. (3) A domain-specific prompt engineering strategy enables the injection of clinical knowledge into LLMs. Our method achieves an F1-score of 95.24\% in diagnosing ASD in children with an average age of two years while generating interpretable detection rationales.

### MuRAL: A Multi-Resident Ambient Sensor Dataset Annotated with Natural   Language for Activities of Daily Living
**Authors**: Xi Chen, Julien Cumin, Fano Ramparany, Dominique Vaufreydaz

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:46:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential for human activity recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors, especially through natural language reasoning and zero-shot learning. However, existing datasets such as CASAS, ARAS, and MARBLE were not originally designed with LLMs in mind and therefore lack the contextual richness, complexity, and annotation granularity required to fully exploit LLM capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MuRAL, the first Multi-Resident Ambient sensor dataset with natural Language, comprising over 21 hours of multi-user sensor data collected from 21 sessions in a smart-home environment. MuRAL is annotated with fine-grained natural language descriptions, resident identities, and high-level activity labels, all situated in dynamic, realistic multi-resident settings. We benchmark MuRAL using state-of-the-art LLMs for three core tasks: subject assignment, action description, and activity classification. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs can provide rich semantic interpretations of ambient data, current models still face challenges in handling multi-user ambiguity and under-specified sensor contexts. We release MuRAL to support future research on LLM-powered, explainable, and socially aware activity understanding in smart environments. For access to the dataset, please reach out to us via the provided contact information. A direct link for dataset retrieval will be made available at this location in due course.

### UniDetox: Universal Detoxification of Large Language Models via Dataset   Distillation
**Authors**: Huimin Lu, Masaru Isonuma, Junichiro Mori, Ichiro Sakata

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:40:00Z

**Summary**: We present UniDetox, a universally applicable method designed to mitigate toxicity across various large language models (LLMs). Previous detoxification methods are typically model-specific, addressing only individual models or model families, and require careful hyperparameter tuning due to the trade-off between detoxification efficacy and language modeling performance. In contrast, UniDetox provides a detoxification technique that can be universally applied to a wide range of LLMs without the need for separate model-specific tuning. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient dataset distillation technique for detoxification using contrastive decoding. This approach distills detoxifying representations in the form of synthetic text data, enabling universal detoxification of any LLM through fine-tuning with the distilled text. Our experiments demonstrate that the detoxifying text distilled from GPT-2 can effectively detoxify larger models, including OPT, Falcon, and LLaMA-2. Furthermore, UniDetox eliminates the need for separate hyperparameter tuning for each model, as a single hyperparameter configuration can be seamlessly applied across different models. Additionally, analysis of the detoxifying text reveals a reduction in politically biased content, providing insights into the attributes necessary for effective detoxification of LLMs.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents
**Authors**: Dilip Arumugam, Thomas L. Griffiths

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:59:48Z

**Summary**: A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.

**Authors**: Sicheng Mo, Thao Nguyen, Xun Huang, Siddharth Srinivasan Iyer, Yijun Li, Yuchen Liu, Abhishek Tandon, Eli Shechtman, Krishna Kumar Singh, Yong Jae Lee, Bolei Zhou, Yuheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: We propose X-Fusion, a framework that extends pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks while preserving their language capabilities. X-Fusion employs a dual-tower design with modality-specific weights, keeping the LLM's parameters frozen while integrating vision-specific information for both understanding and generation. Our experiments demonstrate that X-Fusion consistently outperforms alternative architectures on both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. We find that incorporating understanding-focused data improves generation quality, reducing image data noise enhances overall performance, and feature alignment accelerates convergence for smaller models but has minimal impact on larger ones. Our findings provide valuable insights into building efficient unified multimodal models.

### ACE: A Security Architecture for LLM-Integrated App Systems
**Authors**: Evan Li, Tushin Mallick, Evan Rose, William Robertson, Alina Oprea, Cristina Nita-Rotaru

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:55:52Z

**Summary**: LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution.   In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.

### Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior
**Authors**: Neil F. Johnson, Frank Yingjie Huo

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:50:29Z

**Summary**: Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts -- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''

### Real-Time Wayfinding Assistant for Blind and Low-Vision Users
**Authors**: Dabbrata Das, Argho Deb Das, Farhan Sadaf

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:45:04Z

**Summary**: Navigating unfamiliar places continues to be one of the most persistent and essential everyday obstacles for those who are blind or have limited vision (BLV). Existing assistive technologies, such as GPS-based navigation systems, AI-powered smart glasses, and sonar-equipped canes, often face limitations in real-time obstacle avoidance, precise localization, and adaptability to dynamic surroundings. To investigate potential solutions, we introduced PathFinder, a novel map-less navigation system that explores different models for understanding 2D images, including Vision Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and employs monocular depth estimation for free-path detection. Our approach integrates a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on depth images to determine the longest obstacle-free path, ensuring optimal route selection while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted comparative evaluations against existing AI-powered navigation methods and performed a usability study with BLV participants. The results demonstrate that PathFinder achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time responsiveness. Notably, it reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and improves decision-making speed in outdoor navigation compared to AI-based alternatives. Participant feedback emphasizes the system's usability and effectiveness in outside situations, but also identifies issues in complicated indoor locations and low-light conditions. Usability testing revealed that 73% of participants understood how to use the app in about a minute, and 80% praised its balance of accuracy, quick response, and overall convenience.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:42:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal performance impact. However, existing methods often suffer from performance loss without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Further experiments indicate our proposed method is orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, where Wanda++ can be combined with LoRA fine-tuning to achieve a similar perplexity improvement as the Wanda method. The proposed method is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.

### SetKE: Knowledge Editing for Knowledge Elements Overlap
**Authors**: Yifan Wei, Xiaoyan Yu, Ran Song, Hao Peng, Angsheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:40:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as retrieval and question answering but require updates to incorporate new knowledge and reduce inaccuracies and hallucinations. Traditional updating methods, like fine-tuning and incremental learning, face challenges such as overfitting and high computational costs. Knowledge Editing (KE) provides a promising alternative but often overlooks the Knowledge Element Overlap (KEO) phenomenon, where multiple triplets share common elements, leading to editing conflicts. We identify the prevalence of KEO in existing KE datasets and show its significant impact on current KE methods, causing performance degradation in handling such triplets. To address this, we propose a new formulation, Knowledge Set Editing (KSE), and introduce SetKE, a method that edits sets of triplets simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that SetKE outperforms existing methods in KEO scenarios on mainstream LLMs. Additionally, we introduce EditSet, a dataset containing KEO triplets, providing a comprehensive benchmark.

### AegisLLM: Scaling Agentic Systems for Self-Reflective Defense in LLM   Security
**Authors**: Zikui Cai, Shayan Shabihi, Bang An, Zora Che, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:36:05Z

**Summary**: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

### OSVBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Specification Generation Tasks for   Operating System Verification
**Authors**: Shangyu Li, Juyong Jiang, Tiancheng Zhao, Jiasi Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:34:49Z

**Summary**: We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks. The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model. The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system. This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification. Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench.

### Security Steerability is All You Need
**Authors**: Itay Hazan, Idan Habler, Ron Bitton, Itsik Mantin

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:22:55Z

**Summary**: The adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in various applications inevitably comes with expanding the attack surface, combining new security threats along with the traditional ones. Consequently, numerous research and industrial initiatives aim to mitigate these security threats in GenAI by developing metrics and designing defenses. However, while most of the GenAI security work focuses on universal threats (e.g. manipulating the LLM to generate forbidden content), there is significantly less discussion on application-level security and how to mitigate it. Thus, in this work we adopt an application-centric approach to GenAI security, and show that while LLMs cannot protect against ad-hoc application specific threats, they can provide the framework for applications to protect themselves against such threats. Our first contribution is defining Security Steerability - a novel security measure for LLMs, assessing the model's capability to adhere to strict guardrails that are defined in the system prompt ('Refrain from discussing about politics'). These guardrails, in case effective, can stop threats in the presence of malicious users who attempt to circumvent the application and cause harm to its providers. Our second contribution is a methodology to measure the security steerability of LLMs, utilizing two newly-developed datasets: VeganRibs assesses the LLM behavior in forcing specific guardrails that are not security per se in the presence of malicious user that uses attack boosters (jailbreaks and perturbations), and ReverseText takes this approach further and measures the LLM ability to force specific treatment of the user input as plain text while do user try to give it additional meanings...

### Information Gravity: A Field-Theoretic Model for Token Selection in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Maryna Vyshnyvetska

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:21:20Z

**Summary**: We propose a theoretical model called "information gravity" to describe the text generation process in large language models (LLMs). The model uses physical apparatus from field theory and spacetime geometry to formalize the interaction between user queries and the probability distribution of generated tokens. A query is viewed as an object with "information mass" that curves the semantic space of the model, creating gravitational potential wells that "attract" tokens during generation. This model offers a mechanism to explain several observed phenomena in LLM behavior, including hallucinations (emerging from low-density semantic voids), sensitivity to query formulation (due to semantic field curvature changes), and the influence of sampling temperature on output diversity.

### Trace-of-Thought: Enhanced Arithmetic Problem Solving via Reasoning   Distillation From Large to Small Language Models
**Authors**: Tyler McDonald, Ali Emami

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:14:54Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be leveraged for daily tasks, prompt engineering remains an active field of contribution within computational linguistics, particularly in domains requiring specialized knowledge such as arithmetic reasoning. While these LLMs are optimized for a variety of tasks, their exhaustive employment may become computationally or financially cumbersome for small teams. Additionally, complete reliance on proprietary, closed-source models often limits customization and adaptability, posing significant challenges in research and application scalability. Instead, by leveraging open-source models at or below 7 billion parameters, we can optimize our resource usage while still observing remarkable gains over standard prompting approaches. To cultivate this notion, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a simple, zero-shot prompt engineering method that instructs LLMs to create observable subproblems using critical problem-solving, specifically designed to enhance arithmetic reasoning capabilities. When applied to open-source models in tandem with GPT-4, we observe that Trace-of-Thought not only allows novel insight into the problem-solving process but also introduces performance gains as large as 125% on language models at or below 7 billion parameters. This approach underscores the potential of open-source initiatives in democratizing AI research and improving the accessibility of high-quality computational linguistics applications.

### An LLM-Powered Agent for Physiological Data Analysis: A Case Study on   PPG-based Heart Rate Estimation
**Authors**: Mohammad Feli, Iman Azimi, Pasi Liljeberg, Amir M. Rahmani

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:14:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnosis, patient care, and decision support through interactive communication. More recently, they have been applied to analyzing physiological time-series like wearable data for health insight extraction. Existing methods embed raw numerical sequences directly into prompts, which exceeds token limits and increases computational costs. Additionally, some studies integrated features extracted from time-series in textual prompts or applied multimodal approaches. However, these methods often produce generic and unreliable outputs due to LLMs' limited analytical rigor and inefficiency in interpreting continuous waveforms. In this paper, we develop an LLM-powered agent for physiological time-series analysis aimed to bridge the gap in integrating LLMs with well-established analytical tools. Built on the OpenCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, our agent powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model features an orchestrator that integrates user interaction, data sources, and analytical tools to generate accurate health insights. To evaluate its effectiveness, we implement a case study on heart rate (HR) estimation from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using a dataset of PPG and Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in a remote health monitoring study. The agent's performance is benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, with ECG serving as the gold standard for HR estimation. Results demonstrate that our agent significantly outperforms benchmark models by achieving lower error rates and more reliable HR estimations. The agent implementation is publicly available on GitHub.

### ChestX-Reasoner: Advancing Radiology Foundation Models with Reasoning   through Step-by-Step Verification
**Authors**: Ziqing Fan, Cheng Liang, Chaoyi Wu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:48:23Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in complex tasks, yet medical AI models often overlook the structured reasoning processes inherent in clinical practice. In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy. All resources are open-sourced to facilitate further research in medical reasoning MLLMs.

### A Domain-Agnostic Scalable AI Safety Ensuring Framework
**Authors**: Beomjun Kim, Kangyeon Kim, Sunwoo Kim, Heejin Ahn

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:38:35Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the safety of AI systems has recently emerged as a critical priority for real-world deployment, particularly in physical AI applications. Current approaches to AI safety typically address predefined domain-specific safety conditions, limiting their ability to generalize across contexts.   We propose a novel AI safety framework that ensures AI systems comply with \textbf{any user-defined constraint}, with \textbf{any desired probability}, and across \textbf{various domains}.   In this framework, we combine an AI component (e.g., neural network) with an optimization problem to produce responses that minimize objectives while satisfying user-defined constraints with probabilities exceeding user-defined thresholds. For credibility assessment of the AI component, we propose \textit{internal test data}, a supplementary set of safety-labeled data, and a \textit{conservative testing} methodology that provides statistical validity of using internal test data. We also present an approximation method of a loss function and how to compute its gradient for training.   We mathematically prove that probabilistic constraint satisfaction is guaranteed under specific, mild conditions and prove a scaling law between safety and the number of internal test data. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness through experiments in diverse domains: demand prediction for production decision, safe reinforcement learning within the SafetyGym simulator, and guarding AI chatbot outputs. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that our method guarantees safety for user-specified constraints, outperforms {for \textbf{up to several order of magnitudes}} existing methods in low safety threshold regions, and scales effectively with respect to the size of internal test data.

### DYNAMAX: Dynamic computing for Transformers and Mamba based   architectures
**Authors**: Miguel Nogales, Matteo Gambella, Manuel Roveri

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:38:15Z

**Summary**: Early exits (EEs) offer a promising approach to reducing computational costs and latency by dynamically terminating inference once a satisfactory prediction confidence on a data sample is achieved. Although many works integrate EEs into encoder-only Transformers, their application to decoder-only architectures and, more importantly, Mamba models, a novel family of state-space architectures in the LLM realm, remains insufficiently explored. This work introduces DYNAMAX, the first framework to exploit the unique properties of Mamba architectures for early exit mechanisms. We not only integrate EEs into Mamba but also repurpose Mamba as an efficient EE classifier for both Mamba-based and transformer-based LLMs, showcasing its versatility. Our experiments employ the Mistral 7B transformer compared to the Codestral 7B Mamba model, using data sets such as TruthfulQA, CoQA, and TriviaQA to evaluate computational savings, accuracy, and consistency. The results highlight the adaptability of Mamba as a powerful EE classifier and its efficiency in balancing computational cost and performance quality across NLP tasks. By leveraging Mamba's inherent design for dynamic processing, we open pathways for scalable and efficient inference in embedded applications and resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the transformative potential of Mamba in redefining dynamic computing paradigms for LLMs.

### Optimal In-Network Distribution of Learning Functions for a   Secure-by-Design Programmable Data Plane of Next-Generation Networks
**Authors**: Mattia Giovanni Spina, Edoardo Scalzo, Floriano De Rango, Francesca Guerriero, Antonio Iera

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:33:52Z

**Summary**: The rise of programmable data plane (PDP) and in-network computing (INC) paradigms paves the way for the development of network devices (switches, network interface cards, etc.) capable of performing advanced processing tasks. This allows running various types of algorithms, including machine learning, within the network itself to support user and network services. In particular, this paper delves into the deployment of in-network learning models with the aim of implementing fully distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Specifically, a model is proposed for the optimal distribution of the IDS/IPS workload among data plane devices with the aim of ensuring complete network security without excessively burdening the normal operations of the devices. Furthermore, a meta-heuristic approach is proposed to reduce the long computation time required by the exact solution provided by the mathematical model and its performance is evaluated. The analysis conducted and the results obtained demonstrate the enormous potential of the proposed new approach for the creation of intelligent data planes that act effectively and autonomously as the first line of defense against cyber attacks, with minimal additional workload on the network devices involved.

### Omni-IML: Towards Unified Image Manipulation Localization
**Authors**: Chenfan Qu, Yiwu Zhong, Fengjun Guo, Lianwen Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:31:20Z

**Summary**: Existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods mostly rely heavily on task-specific designs, making them perform well only on the target IML task, while joint training on multiple IML tasks causes significant performance degradation, hindering real applications.   To this end, we propose Omni-IML, the first generalist model designed to unify IML across diverse tasks.   Specifically, Omni-IML achieves generalization through three key components: (1) a Modal Gate Encoder, which adaptively selects the optimal encoding modality per sample, (2) a Dynamic Weight Decoder, which dynamically adjusts decoder filters to the task at hand, and (3) an Anomaly Enhancement module that leverages box supervision to highlight the tampered regions and facilitate the learning of task-agnostic features.   Beyond localization, to support interpretation of the tampered images, we construct Omni-273k, a large high-quality dataset that includes natural language descriptions of tampered artifact. It is annotated through our automatic, chain-of-thoughts annotation technique.   We also design a simple-yet-effective interpretation module to better utilize these descriptive annotations.

### An Empirical Study on the Capability of LLMs in Decomposing Bug Reports
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Chen, Vanessa Nava-Camal, Ahmad Suleiman, Yiming Tang, Daqing Hou, Weiyi Shang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T16:29:12Z

**Summary**: Background: Bug reports are essential to the software development life cycle. They help developers track and resolve issues, but are often difficult to process due to their complexity, which can delay resolution and affect software quality. Aims: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can assist developers in automatically decomposing complex bug reports into smaller, self-contained units, making them easier to understand and address. Method: We conducted an empirical study on 127 resolved privacy-related bug reports collected from Apache Jira. We evaluated ChatGPT and DeepSeek using different prompting strategies. We first tested both LLMs with zero-shot prompts, then applied improved prompts with demonstrations (using few-shot prompting) to measure their abilities in bug decomposition. Results: Our findings show that LLMs are capable of decomposing bug reports, but their overall performance still requires further improvement and strongly depends on the quality of the prompts. With zero-shot prompts, both studied LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) performed poorly. After prompt tuning, ChatGPT's true decomposition rate increased by 140\% and DeepSeek's by 163.64\%. Conclusions: LLMs show potential in helping developers analyze and decompose complex bug reports, but they still need improvement in terms of accuracy and bug understanding.

**Summary**: Given natural language test case description for an Android application, existing testing approaches require developers to manually write scripts using tools such as Appium and Espresso to execute the corresponding test case. This process is labor-intensive and demands significant effort to maintain as UI interfaces evolve throughout development. In this work, we introduce LELANTE, a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate test case execution without requiring pre-written scripts. LELANTE interprets natural language test case descriptions, iteratively generate action plans, and perform the actions directly on the Android screen using its GUI. LELANTE employs a screen refinement process to enhance LLM interpretability, constructs a structured prompt for LLMs, and implements an action generation mechanism based on chain-of-thought reasoning of LLMs. To further reduce computational cost and enhance scalability, LELANTE utilizes model distillation using a foundational LLM. In experiments across 390 test cases spanning 10 popular Android applications, LELANTE achieved a 73% test execution success rate. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively bridge the gap between natural language test case description and automated execution, making mobile testing more scalable and adaptable.

**Authors**: Hui Han, Siyuan Li, Jiaqi Chen, Yiwen Yuan, Yuling Wu, Chak Tou Leong, Hanwen Du, Junchen Fu, Youhua Li, Jie Zhang, Chi Zhang, Li-jia Li, Yongxin Ni

**Summary**: Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.

**Summary**: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field

### Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yunjia Qi, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:38:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### Optimizing Personalized Federated Learning through Adaptive Layer-Wise   Learning
**Authors**: Weihang Chen, Cheng Yang, Jie Ren, Zhiqiang Li, Zheng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:33:00Z

**Summary**: Real-life deployment of federated Learning (FL) often faces non-IID data, which leads to poor accuracy and slow convergence. Personalized FL (pFL) tackles these issues by tailoring local models to individual data sources and using weighted aggregation methods for client-specific learning. However, existing pFL methods often fail to provide each local model with global knowledge on demand while maintaining low computational overhead. Additionally, local models tend to over-personalize their data during the training process, potentially dropping previously acquired global information. We propose FLAYER, a novel layer-wise learning method for pFL that optimizes local model personalization performance. FLAYER considers the different roles and learning abilities of neural network layers of individual local models. It incorporates global information for each local model as needed to initialize the local model cost-effectively. It then dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer during local training, optimizing the personalized learning process for each local model while preserving global knowledge. Additionally, to enhance global representation in pFL, FLAYER selectively uploads parameters for global aggregation in a layer-wise manner. We evaluate FLAYER on four representative datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. Compared to six state-of-the-art pFL methods, FLAYER improves the inference accuracy, on average, by 5.40\% (up to 14.29\%).

### Agentic AI: The Era of Semantic Decoding
**Authors**: Maxime Peyrard, Martin Josifoski, Robert West

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:24:52Z

**Summary**: Recent work demonstrated great promise in the idea of orchestrating collaborations between LLMs, human input, and various tools to address the inherent limitations of LLMs. We propose a novel perspective called semantic decoding, which frames these collaborative processes as optimization procedures in semantic space. Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens (known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors, including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors. Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much greater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize the transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between syntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding algorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions arising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers a powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new type of computation.

### JaccDiv: A Metric and Benchmark for Quantifying Diversity of Generated   Marketing Text in the Music Industry
**Authors**: Anum Afzal, Alexandre Mercier, Florian Matthes

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:19:06Z

**Summary**: Online platforms are increasingly interested in using Data-to-Text technologies to generate content and help their users. Unfortunately, traditional generative methods often fall into repetitive patterns, resulting in monotonous galleries of texts after only a few iterations. In this paper, we investigate LLM-based data-to-text approaches to automatically generate marketing texts that are of sufficient quality and diverse enough for broad adoption. We leverage Language Models such as T5, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMa2 in conjunction with fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot approaches to set a baseline for diverse marketing texts. We also introduce a metric JaccDiv to evaluate the diversity of a set of texts. This research extends its relevance beyond the music industry, proving beneficial in various fields where repetitive automated content generation is prevalent.

### Virology Capabilities Test (VCT): A Multimodal Virology Q&A Benchmark
**Authors**: Jasper Götting, Pedro Medeiros, Jon G Sanders, Nathaniel Li, Long Phan, Karam Elabd, Lennart Justen, Dan Hendrycks, Seth Donoughe

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T15:14:35Z

**Summary**: We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.

### Enhancing Non-Core Language Instruction-Following in Speech LLMs via   Semi-Implicit Cross-Lingual CoT Reasoning
**Authors**: Hongfei Xue, Yufeng Tang, Hexin Liu, Jun Zhang, Xuelong Geng, Lei Xie

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:59:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs). While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs. The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities. To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training. By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN. Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores. Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages. To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French.

### Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning Under Memory Constraints
**Authors**: Alan Lee, Harry Tong

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:58:43Z

**Summary**: We explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance reasoning within targeted problem spaces in large language models (LLMs) under memory and compute constraints. Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.

### Ascendra: Dynamic Request Prioritization for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Azam Ikram, Xiang Li, Sameh Elnikety, Saurabh Bagchi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:51:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for more efficient serving strategies. In this context, efficiency refers to the proportion of requests that meet their Service Level Objectives (SLOs), particularly for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). However, existing systems often prioritize one metric at the cost of the other. We present Ascendra, an LLM serving system designed to meet both TTFT and TBT SLOs simultaneously. The core insight behind Ascendra is that a request's urgency evolves as it approaches its deadline. To leverage this, Ascendra partitions GPU resources into two types of instances: low-priority and high-priority. Low-priority instances maximize throughput by processing requests out of arrival order, but at the risk of request starvation. To address this, Ascendra employs a performance model to predict requests at risk of missing their SLOs and proactively offloads them to high-priority instances. High-priority instances are optimized for low-latency execution and handle urgent requests nearing their deadlines. This partitioned architecture enables Ascendra to effectively balance high throughput and low latency. Extensive evaluation shows that Ascendra improves system throughput by up to 1.7x compared to vLLM and Sarathi-Serve while meeting both TTFT and TBT SLOs.

### LocAgent: Graph-Guided LLM Agents for Code Localization
**Authors**: Zhaoling Chen, Xiangru Tang, Gangda Deng, Fang Wu, Jialong Wu, Zhiwei Jiang, Viktor Prasanna, Arman Cohan, Xingyao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:37:43Z

**Summary**: Code localization--identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made--is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10). Our code is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/LocAgent.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:25:08Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

### Hallucination by Code Generation LLMs: Taxonomy, Benchmarks, Mitigation,   and Challenges
**Authors**: Yunseo Lee, John Youngeun Song, Dongsun Kim, Jindae Kim, Mijung Kim, Jaechang Nam

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:13:57Z

**Summary**: Recent technical breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have enabled them to fluently generate source code. Software developers often leverage both general-purpose and code-specialized LLMs to revise existing code or even generate a whole function from scratch. These capabilities are also beneficial in no-code or low-code contexts, in which one can write programs without a technical background. However, due to their internal design, LLMs are prone to generating hallucinations, which are incorrect, nonsensical, and not justifiable information but difficult to identify its presence. This problem also occurs when generating source code. Once hallucinated code is produced, it is often challenging for users to identify and fix it, especially when such hallucinations can be identified under specific execution paths. As a result, the hallucinated code may remain unnoticed within the codebase. This survey investigates recent studies and techniques relevant to hallucinations generated by CodeLLMs. We categorize the types of hallucinations in the code generated by CodeLLMs, review existing benchmarks and mitigation strategies, and identify open challenges. Based on these findings, this survey outlines further research directions in the detection and removal of hallucinations produced by CodeLLMs.

### Partitioned Memory Storage Inspired Few-Shot Class-Incremental learning
**Authors**: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Jinghua Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:11:06Z

**Summary**: Current mainstream deep learning techniques exhibit an over-reliance on extensive training data and a lack of adaptability to the dynamic world, marking a considerable disparity from human intelligence. To bridge this gap, Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) has emerged, focusing on continuous learning of new categories with limited samples without forgetting old knowledge. Existing FSCIL studies typically use a single model to learn knowledge across all sessions, inevitably leading to the stability-plasticity dilemma. Unlike machines, humans store varied knowledge in different cerebral cortices. Inspired by this characteristic, our paper aims to develop a method that learns independent models for each session. It can inherently prevent catastrophic forgetting. During the testing stage, our method integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for model deployment. Our method provides a fresh viewpoint for FSCIL and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and mini-ImageNet datasets.

### Q-Fusion: Diffusing Quantum Circuits
**Authors**: Collin Beaudoin, Swaroop Ghosh

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:10:10Z

**Summary**: Quantum computing holds great potential for solving socially relevant and computationally complex problems. Furthermore, quantum machine learning (QML) promises to rapidly improve our current machine learning capabilities. However, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by limitations in the number of qubits and gate counts, which hinder their full capabilities. Furthermore, the design of quantum algorithms remains a laborious task, requiring significant domain expertise and time. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel quantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to generate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that utilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational autoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently generates 100% valid quantum circuit outputs.

### Using LLMs in Generating Design Rationale for Software Architecture   Decisions
**Authors**: Xiyu Zhou, Ruiyin Li, Peng Liang, Beiqi Zhang, Mojtaba Shahin, Zengyang Li, Chen Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:00:18Z

**Summary**: Design Rationale (DR) for software architecture decisions refers to the reasoning underlying architectural choices, which provides valuable insights into the different phases of the architecting process throughout software development. However, in practice, DR is often inadequately documented due to a lack of motivation and effort from developers. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in text comprehension, reasoning, and generation may enable the generation and recovery of DR for architecture decisions. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in generating DR for architecture decisions. First, we collected 50 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, 25 GitHub issues, and 25 GitHub discussions related to architecture decisions to construct a dataset of 100 architecture-related problems. Then, we selected five LLMs to generate DR for the architecture decisions with three prompting strategies, including zero-shot, chain of thought (CoT), and LLM-based agents. With the DR provided by human experts as ground truth, the Precision of LLM-generated DR with the three prompting strategies ranges from 0.267 to 0.278, Recall from 0.627 to 0.715, and F1-score from 0.351 to 0.389. Additionally, 64.45% to 69.42% of the arguments of DR not mentioned by human experts are also helpful, 4.12% to 4.87% of the arguments have uncertain correctness, and 1.59% to 3.24% of the arguments are potentially misleading. Based on the results, we further discussed the pros and cons of the three prompting strategies and the strengths and limitations of the DR generated by LLMs.

### Beyond the Safety Bundle: Auditing the Helpful and Harmless Dataset
**Authors**: Khaoula Chehbouni, Jonathan Colaço Carr, Yash More, Jackie CK Cheung, Golnoosh Farnadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:58:44Z

**Summary**: In an effort to mitigate the harms of large language models (LLMs), learning from human feedback (LHF) has been used to steer LLMs towards outputs that are intended to be both less harmful and more helpful. Despite the widespread adoption of LHF in practice, the quality of this feedback and its effectiveness as a safety mitigation technique remain unclear. This study addresses these issues by auditing the widely-used Helpful and Harmless (HH) dataset by Anthropic. Our work includes: (1) a thorough investigation of the dataset's content through both manual and automated evaluation; (2) experiments demonstrating the dataset's impact on models' safety; and (3) an analysis of the 100 most influential papers citing this dataset. Through our audit, we showcase how conceptualization failures and quality issues identified in the HH dataset can create additional harms by leading to disparate safety behaviors across demographic groups. Our findings highlight the need for more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to safety mitigation in LLMs.

### Turing Machine Evaluation for Large Language Model
**Authors**: Haitao Wu, Zongbo Han, Huaxi Huang, Changqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:52:47Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development and widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), rigorous evaluation has become particularly crucial. This research adopts a novel perspective, focusing on evaluating the core computational reasoning ability of LLMs, defined as the capacity of model to accurately understand rules, and execute logically computing operations. This capability assesses the reliability of LLMs as precise executors, and is critical to advanced tasks such as complex code generation and multi-step problem-solving. We propose an evaluation framework based on Universal Turing Machine (UTM) simulation. This framework requires LLMs to strictly follow instructions and track dynamic states, such as tape content and read/write head position, during multi-step computations. To enable standardized evaluation, we developed TMBench, a benchmark for systematically studying the computational reasoning capabilities of LLMs. TMBench provides several key advantages, including knowledge-agnostic evaluation, adjustable difficulty, foundational coverage through Turing machine encoding, and unlimited capacity for instance generation, ensuring scalability as models continue to evolve. We find that model performance on TMBench correlates strongly with performance on other recognized reasoning benchmarks (Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.73), clearly demonstrating that computational reasoning is a significant dimension for measuring the deep capabilities of LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HaitaoWuTJU/Turing-Machine-Bench.

### Understanding Large Language Model Supply Chain: Structure, Domain, and   Vulnerabilities
**Authors**: Yanzhe Hu, Shenao Wang, Tianyuan Nie, Yanjie Zhao, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:44:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI), driving breakthroughs in natural language understanding, text generation, and autonomous systems. However, the rapid growth of LLMs presents significant challenges in the security and reliability of the Large Language Model Supply Chain (LLMSC), a complex network of open-source components, libraries, and tools essential for LLM development and deployment. Despite its critical importance, the LLMSC remains underexplored, particularly regarding its structural characteristics, domain composition, and security vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct the first empirical study of the LLMSC, analyzing a curated dataset of open-source packages from PyPI and NPM across 14 functional domains. We construct a directed dependency graph comprising 15,725 nodes, 10,402 edges, and 180 unique vulnerabilities to investigate the structural characteristics of the LLMSC and analyze how security risks propagate through its dependency network. Our findings reveal that the LLMSC exhibits a ``locally dense, globally sparse'' topology, with 79.7% of dependency trees containing fewer than 5 nodes, while a few large trees dominate the ecosystem, accounting for 77.66% of all nodes. The graph is characterized by high-degree hubs, with the top 5 most connected nodes averaging 1,282 dependents each. Security analysis shows that critical vulnerabilities propagate to an average of 142.1 nodes at the second layer of dependency trees and peak at 237.8 affected nodes at the third layer. Notably, cascading risks are concentrated in critical hub nodes such as transformers, which directly or indirectly affect over 1,300 downstream packages. These findings provide quantitative insights into the structural and security dynamics of the LLMSC and emphasize the need for targeted mitigation strategies to enhance ecosystem resilience.

### An Online Cross-layered Defense Strategy with Bandwidth Allocation for   Multi-channel Systems under DoS Attacks
**Authors**: Liheng Wan, Panshuo Li, James Lam

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:43:26Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes an online cross-layered defense strategy for multi-channel systems with switched dynamics under DoS attacks. The enabling condition of a channel under attacks is formulated with respect to attack flow and channel bandwidth, then a new networked control system model bridging the gap between system dynamics and network deployment is built. Based on this, the cross-layered defense strategy is proposed. It jointly optimizes the controller gain and bandwidth allocation of channels according to the real-time attack flow and system dynamics, by solving a mixed-integer semidefinite programming online. A smart enumeration algorithm for non-convex bi-level optimization is proposed to analyze the stability under the strategy. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the high resilience from the cross-layered feature.

### LLM-Generated Fake News Induces Truth Decay in News Ecosystem: A Case   Study on Neural News Recommendation
**Authors**: Beizhe Hu, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Yang Li, Danding Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:41:59Z

**Summary**: Online fake news moderation now faces a new challenge brought by the malicious use of large language models (LLMs) in fake news production. Though existing works have shown LLM-generated fake news is hard to detect from an individual aspect, it remains underexplored how its large-scale release will impact the news ecosystem. In this study, we develop a simulation pipeline and a dataset with ~56k generated news of diverse types to investigate the effects of LLM-generated fake news within neural news recommendation systems. Our findings expose a truth decay phenomenon, where real news is gradually losing its advantageous position in news ranking against fake news as LLM-generated news is involved in news recommendation. We further provide an explanation about why truth decay occurs from a familiarity perspective and show the positive correlation between perplexity and news ranking. Finally, we discuss the threats of LLM-generated fake news and provide possible countermeasures. We urge stakeholders to address this emerging challenge to preserve the integrity of news ecosystems.

### Graph-Based Fault Diagnosis for Rotating Machinery: Adaptive   Segmentation and Structural Feature Integration
**Authors**: Moirangthem Tiken Singh

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:34:52Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a novel graph-based framework for robust and interpretable multiclass fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The method integrates entropy-optimized signal segmentation, time-frequency feature extraction, and graph-theoretic modeling to transform vibration signals into structured representations suitable for classification. Graph metrics, such as average shortest path length, modularity, and spectral gap, are computed and combined with local features to capture global and segment-level fault characteristics. The proposed method achieves high diagnostic accuracy when evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the CWRU bearing dataset (under 0-3 HP loads) and the SU gearbox and bearing datasets (under different speed-load configurations). Classification scores reach up to 99.8% accuracy on Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and 100% accuracy on the Southeast University datasets using a logistic regression classifier. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong noise resilience, maintaining over 95.4% accuracy at high noise levels (standard deviation = 0.5), and demonstrates excellent cross-domain transferability with up to 99.7% F1-score in load-transfer scenarios. Compared to traditional techniques, this approach requires no deep learning architecture, enabling lower complexity while ensuring interpretability. The results confirm the method's scalability, reliability, and potential for real-time deployment in industrial diagnostics.

### Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Global Planning and Hierarchical   Execution
**Authors**: Junjie Chen, Haitao Li, Jingli Yang, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:30:20Z

**Summary**: Intelligent agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in real-world applications. However, existing agent frameworks still face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting their effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning methods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local branches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution mechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited action space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that introduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a hierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into high-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby reducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across diverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark with multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of tools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate. These findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more advanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex real-world applications. Our code can be found at https://github.com/cjj826/GoalAct.

**Authors**: AJ Miller, Fangzhou Yu, Michael Brauckmann, Farbod Farshidian

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T13:13:48Z

**Summary**: This work presents an overview of the technical details behind a high performance reinforcement learning policy deployment with the Spot RL Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot. This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces, disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low level API.

### AlphaFuse: Learn ID Embeddings for Sequential Recommendation in Null   Space of Language Embeddings
**Authors**: Guoqing Hu, An Zhang, Shuo Liu, Zhibo Cai, Xun Yang, Xiang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:59:17Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in sequential recommendation have underscored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing item embeddings. However, existing approaches face three key limitations: 1) the degradation of the semantic space when high-dimensional language embeddings are mapped to lower-dimensional ID embeddings, 2) the underutilization of language embeddings, and 3) the reliance on additional trainable parameters, such as an adapter, to bridge the gap between the semantic and behavior spaces. In this paper, we introduce AlphaFuse, a simple but effective language-guided learning strategy that addresses these challenges by learning ID embeddings within the null space of language embeddings. Specifically, we decompose the semantic space of language embeddings via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), distinguishing it into a semantic-rich row space and a semantic-sparse null space. Collaborative signals are then injected into the null space, while preserving the rich semantics of the row space. AlphaFuse prevents degradation of the semantic space, integrates the retained language embeddings into the final item embeddings, and eliminates the need for auxiliary trainable modules, enabling seamless adaptation to any sequential recommendation framework. We validate the effectiveness and flexibility of AlphaFuse through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including cold-start user and long-tail settings, showcasing significant improvements in both discriminative and diffusion-based generative sequential recommenders. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Hugo-Chinn/AlphaFuse.

### SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMIRe -- Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity   Representation
**Authors**: Thomas Pickard, Aline Villavicencio, Maggie Mi, Wei He, Dylan Phelps, Marco Idiart

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:42:33Z

**Summary**: Idiomatic expressions present a unique challenge in NLP, as their meanings are often not directly inferable from their constituent words. Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence. The most effective methods achieved human-level performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs and vision-language models in mixture-of-experts settings, with multiple queries used to smooth over the weaknesses in these models' representations of idiomaticity.

### Beyond the Last Answer: Your Reasoning Trace Uncovers More than You   Think
**Authors**: Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Hani Itani, Bernard Ghanem

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:39:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning trace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its conclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by posing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent the model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different results? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps, termed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach involves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on linguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from the end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer from every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We find that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the mode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on the answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency among the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics that correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting potential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various LLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025) show consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\% and 10\% respectively. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/SubthoughtReasoner.

### Can LLMs Detect Intrinsic Hallucinations in Paraphrasing and Machine   Translation?
**Authors**: Evangelia Gogoulou, Shorouq Zahra, Liane Guillou, Luise Dürlich, Joakim Nivre

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:30:05Z

**Summary**: A frequently observed problem with LLMs is their tendency to generate output that is nonsensical, illogical, or factually incorrect, often referred to broadly as hallucination. Building on the recently proposed HalluciGen task for hallucination detection and generation, we evaluate a suite of open-access LLMs on their ability to detect intrinsic hallucinations in two conditional generation tasks: translation and paraphrasing. We study how model performance varies across tasks and language and we investigate the impact of model size, instruction tuning, and prompt choice. We find that performance varies across models but is consistent across prompts. Finally, we find that NLI models perform comparably well, suggesting that LLM-based detectors are not the only viable option for this specific task.

### Identifying Uncertainty in Self-Adaptive Robotics with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Hassan Sartaj, Jalil Boudjadar, Mirgita Frasheri, Shaukat Ali, Peter Gorm Larsen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T12:07:39Z

**Summary**: Future self-adaptive robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments while effectively managing uncertainties. However, identifying the sources and impacts of uncertainties in such robotic systems and defining appropriate mitigation strategies is challenging due to the inherent complexity of self-adaptive robots and the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the various factors influencing uncertainty. Hence, practitioners often rely on intuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties. In this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle. For this evaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four industrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners' perspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties. Results showed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed strong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:57:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in software engineering, excelling in tasks like code generation and maintenance. However, existing benchmarks are often narrow in scope, focusing on a specific task and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework that reflects real-world applications. To address these gaps, we introduce CoCo-Bench (Comprehensive Code Benchmark), designed to evaluate LLMs across four critical dimensions: code understanding, code generation, code modification, and code review. These dimensions capture essential developer needs, ensuring a more systematic and representative evaluation. CoCo-Bench includes multiple programming languages and varying task difficulties, with rigorous manual review to ensure data quality and accuracy. Empirical results show that CoCo-Bench aligns with existing benchmarks while uncovering significant variations in model performance, effectively highlighting strengths and weaknesses. By offering a holistic and objective evaluation, CoCo-Bench provides valuable insights to guide future research and technological advancements in code-oriented LLMs, establishing a reliable benchmark for the field.

### A Generative-AI-Driven Claim Retrieval System Capable of Detecting and   Retrieving Claims from Social Media Platforms in Multiple Languages
**Authors**: Ivan Vykopal, Martin Hyben, Robert Moro, Michal Gregor, Jakub Simko

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:49:05Z

**Summary**: Online disinformation poses a global challenge, placing significant demands on fact-checkers who must verify claims efficiently to prevent the spread of false information. A major issue in this process is the redundant verification of already fact-checked claims, which increases workload and delays responses to newly emerging claims. This research introduces an approach that retrieves previously fact-checked claims, evaluates their relevance to a given input, and provides supplementary information to support fact-checkers. Our method employs large language models (LLMs) to filter irrelevant fact-checks and generate concise summaries and explanations, enabling fact-checkers to faster assess whether a claim has been verified before. In addition, we evaluate our approach through both automatic and human assessments, where humans interact with the developed tool to review its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that LLMs are able to filter out many irrelevant fact-checks and, therefore, reduce effort and streamline the fact-checking process.

### DP-2Stage: Adapting Language Models as Differentially Private Tabular   Data Generators
**Authors**: Tejumade Afonja, Hui-Po Wang, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:33:25Z

**Summary**: Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose DP-2Stage, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.

### ComplexVCoder: An LLM-Driven Framework for Systematic Generation of   Complex Verilog Code
**Authors**: Jian Zuo, Junzhe Liu, Xianyong Wang, Yicheng Liu, Navya Goli, Tong Xu, Hao Zhang, Umamaheswara Rao Tida, Zhenge Jia, Mengying Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:22:06Z

**Summary**: Recent advances have demonstrated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.

### Combatting Dimensional Collapse in LLM Pre-Training Data via Diversified   File Selection
**Authors**: Ziqing Fan, Siyuan Du, Shengchao Hu, Pingjie Wang, Li Shen, Ya Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Yanfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:13:18Z

**Summary**: Selecting high-quality pre-training data for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their overall performance under limited computation budget, improving both training and sample efficiency. Recent advancements in file selection primarily rely on using an existing or trained proxy model to assess the similarity of samples to a target domain, such as high quality sources BookCorpus and Wikipedia. However, upon revisiting these methods, the domain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma, i.e.dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the domain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance. To prevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection algorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature space. We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more uniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts, analyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of $\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a benchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with models from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the Harness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall performance. Specifically, DiSF saves 98.5% of 590M training files in SlimPajama, outperforming the full-data pre-training within a 50B training budget, and achieving about 1.5x training efficiency and 5x data efficiency.

### Cooking Up Creativity: A Cognitively-Inspired Approach for Enhancing LLM   Creativity through Structured Representations
**Authors**: Moran Mizrahi, Chen Shani, Gabriel Stanovsky, Dan Jurafsky, Dafna Shahaf

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:13:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at countless tasks, yet struggle with creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with structured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate more creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured representations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively explore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater diversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

### Bridging the Generalisation Gap: Synthetic Data Generation for   Multi-Site Clinical Model Validation
**Authors**: Bradley Segal, Joshua Fieggen, David Clifton, Lei Clifton

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T11:04:28Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the generalisability of clinical machine learning (ML) models across diverse healthcare settings remains a significant challenge due to variability in patient demographics, disease prevalence, and institutional practices. Existing model evaluation approaches often rely on real-world datasets, which are limited in availability, embed confounding biases, and lack the flexibility needed for systematic experimentation. Furthermore, while generative models aim for statistical realism, they often lack transparency and explicit control over factors driving distributional shifts. In this work, we propose a novel structured synthetic data framework designed for the controlled benchmarking of model robustness, fairness, and generalisability. Unlike approaches focused solely on mimicking observed data, our framework provides explicit control over the data generating process, including site-specific prevalence variations, hierarchical subgroup effects, and structured feature interactions. This enables targeted investigation into how models respond to specific distributional shifts and potential biases. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the framework's ability to isolate the impact of site variations, support fairness-aware audits, and reveal generalisation failures, particularly highlighting how model complexity interacts with site-specific effects. This work contributes a reproducible, interpretable, and configurable tool designed to advance the reliable deployment of ML in clinical settings.

**Authors**: Zihan Niu, Zheyong Xie, Shaosheng Cao, Chonggang Lu, Zheyu Ye, Tong Xu, Zuozhu Liu, Yan Gao, Jia Chen, Zhe Xu, Yi Wu, Yao Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:51:58Z

**Summary**: Social chatbots have become essential intelligent companions in daily scenarios ranging from emotional support to personal interaction. However, conventional chatbots with passive response mechanisms usually rely on users to initiate or sustain dialogues by bringing up new topics, resulting in diminished engagement and shortened dialogue duration. In this paper, we present PaRT, a novel framework enabling context-aware proactive dialogues for social chatbots through personalized real-time retrieval and generation. Specifically, PaRT first integrates user profiles and dialogue context into a large language model (LLM), which is initially prompted to refine user queries and recognize their underlying intents for the upcoming conversation. Guided by refined intents, the LLM generates personalized dialogue topics, which then serve as targeted queries to retrieve relevant passages from RedNote. Finally, we prompt LLMs with summarized passages to generate knowledge-grounded and engagement-optimized responses. Our approach has been running stably in a real-world production environment for more than 30 days, achieving a 21.77\% improvement in the average duration of dialogues.

### The Hidden Risks of LLM-Generated Web Application Code: A   Security-Centric Evaluation of Code Generation Capabilities in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Swaroop Dora, Deven Lunkad, Naziya Aslam, S. Venkatesan, Sandeep Kumar Shukla

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:23:11Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enhanced software development processes, minimizing the time and effort required for coding and enhancing developer productivity. However, despite their potential benefits, code generated by LLMs has been shown to generate insecure code in controlled environments, raising critical concerns about their reliability and security in real-world applications. This paper uses predefined security parameters to evaluate the security compliance of LLM-generated code across multiple models, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini and Grok. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, session management, input validation and HTTP security headers. Although some models implement security measures to a limited extent, none fully align with industry best practices, highlighting the associated risks in automated software development. Our findings underscore that human expertise is crucial to ensure secure software deployment or review of LLM-generated code. Also, there is a need for robust security assessment frameworks to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated code in real-world applications.

**Authors**: Michele Garetto, Alessandro Cornacchia, Franco Galante, Emilio Leonardi, Alessandro Nordio, Alberto Tarable

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:21:40Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.

**Authors**: Xinyu Yao, Mengdi Wang, Bo Chen, Xiaobing Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:19:05Z

**Summary**: Classical Chinese, as the core carrier of Chinese culture, plays a crucial role in the inheritance and study of ancient literature. However, existing natural language processing models primarily optimize for Modern Chinese, resulting in inadequate performance on Classical Chinese. This paper presents a comprehensive solution for Classical Chinese language processing. By continuing pre-training and instruction fine-tuning on the LLaMA3-8B-Chinese model, we construct a large language model, WenyanGPT, which is specifically designed for Classical Chinese tasks. Additionally, we develop an evaluation benchmark dataset, WenyanBENCH. Experimental results on WenyanBENCH demonstrate that WenyanGPT significantly outperforms current advanced LLMs in various Classical Chinese tasks. We make the model's training data, instruction fine-tuning data\footnote, and evaluation benchmark dataset publicly available to promote further research and development in the field of Classical Chinese processing.

**Authors**: Jiwoo Kim, Joonhyung Lee, Gunho Park, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee, Youngjoo Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T10:17:15Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their inference demands present significant challenges, particularly due to the high power consumption of AI accelerators in datacenters. These facilities require specialized cooling and power management systems, substantially increasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers (CSPs). In this work, we analyze the computational characteristics and constraints of LLM inference from a TCO perspective, focusing on two representative accelerators: the Gaudi 2 and NVIDIA H100. We present a generalizable framework that enables CSPs to compare and select AI accelerators according to diverse operational requirements. Using this model, we analyze the impact of FP8 precision and LLM inference workload characteristics as key factors influencing TCO. We investigate FP8 quantization, which is gaining adoption in LLM training, as a technique to improve inference throughput while maintaining cost efficiency. Furthermore, our analysis of LLM inference workloads reveals that performance on thin GEMMs, which dominate the decode phase, can have a greater impact than theoretical hardware peak performance. By studying the interaction between power consumption, quantization strategies, and hardware architecture, we offer insights that support informed deployment decisions and guide future accelerator designs to improve the TCO of LLM inference.

### ReasonIR: Training Retrievers for Reasoning Tasks
**Authors**: Rulin Shao, Rui Qiao, Varsha Kishore, Niklas Muennighoff, Xi Victoria Lin, Daniela Rus, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Sewon Min, Wen-tau Yih, Pang Wei Koh, Luke Zettlemoyer

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:49:28Z

**Summary**: We present ReasonIR-8B, the first retriever specifically trained for general reasoning tasks. Existing retrievers have shown limited gains on reasoning tasks, in part because existing training datasets focus on short factual queries tied to documents that straightforwardly answer them. We develop a synthetic data generation pipeline that, for each document, our pipeline creates a challenging and relevant query, along with a plausibly related but ultimately unhelpful hard negative. By training on a mixture of our synthetic data and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a widely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When applied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4% and 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming other retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time compute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases with longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to outperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker. Our training recipe is general and can be easily extended to future LLMs; to this end, we open-source our code, data, and model.

**Authors**: Martin Huber, Huanyu Tian, Christopher E. Mower, Lucas-Raphael Müller, Sébastien Ourselin, Christos Bergeles, Tom Vercauteren

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:39:59Z

**Summary**: This work presents an RGB-D imaging-based approach to marker-free hand-eye calibration using a novel implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm with a robust point-to-plane (PTP) objective formulated on a Lie algebra. Its applicability is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments using three well known serial manipulators and two RGB-D cameras. With only three randomly chosen robot configurations, our approach achieves approximately 90% successful calibrations, demonstrating 2-3x higher convergence rates to the global optimum compared to both marker-based and marker-free baselines. We also report 2 orders of magnitude faster convergence time (0.8 +/- 0.4 s) for 9 robot configurations over other marker-free methods. Our method exhibits significantly improved accuracy (5 mm in task space) over classical approaches (7 mm in task space) whilst being marker-free. The benchmarking dataset and code are open sourced under Apache 2.0 License, and a ROS 2 integration with robot abstraction is provided to facilitate deployment.

### Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One   Training Example
**Authors**: Yiping Wang, Qing Yang, Zhiyuan Zeng, Liliang Ren, Lucas Liu, Baolin Peng, Hao Cheng, Xuehai He, Kuan Wang, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen, Shuohang Wang, Simon Shaolei Du, Yelong Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:24:30Z

**Summary**: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. Our code, model, and data are open source at https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR

### ReCIT: Reconstructing Full Private Data from Gradient in   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jin Xie, Ruishi He, Songze Li, Xiaojun Jia, Shouling Ji

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:23:19Z

**Summary**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical solution for adapting large language models (LLMs) to custom datasets with significantly reduced computational cost. When carrying out PEFT under collaborative learning scenarios (e.g., federated learning), it is often required to exchange model updates (or gradients) across parties. These gradients, even with limited dimensions, can cause severe breach of data privacy. Recent works have shown that both contextual prefixes and personally identifiable information (PII) can be exposed through gradients. However, \emph{simultaneously} and \emph{accurately} recovering both components from the same training instance remains infeasible due to the following challenges: 1) limited number of PEFT parameters; 2) high-dimensional token spaces; and 3) large batch sizes. We propose ReCIT, a novel privacy attack that addresses all challenges, and achieves recovery of \emph{full} private data from PEFT gradients with high fidelity. Specifically, ReCIT proposes to enhance the memorization capability of the pre-trained model through malicious fine-tuning with Personal Notes; ReCIT also proposes a novel filter-based token extraction technique and a token pairing mechanism, to accurately reconstruct tokens from the training sequences with large batch sizes. Extensive evaluations show that ReCIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art gradient inversion and memorization-based attacks across different PEFT paradigms. It achieves up to 10$\times$ higher PII recovery rates and remains effective across varying batch sizes, especially in settings where prefix reconstruction is intractable for conventional approaches. These findings highlight an urgent need to reassess the privacy guarantees of PEFT, especially in decentralized or shared training environments.

### Leveraging Memory Retrieval to Enhance LLM-based Generative   Recommendation
**Authors**: Chengbing Wang, Yang Zhang, Fengbin Zhu, Jizhi Zhang, Tianhao Shi, Fuli Feng

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T09:21:08Z

**Summary**: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to harness user-item interaction histories for item generation has emerged as a promising paradigm in generative recommendation. However, the limited context window of LLMs often restricts them to focusing on recent user interactions only, leading to the neglect of long-term interests involved in the longer histories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Automatic Memory-Retrieval framework (AutoMR), which is capable of storing long-term interests in the memory and extracting relevant information from it for next-item generation within LLMs. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AutoMR framework in utilizing long-term interests for generative recommendation.

### SNR-aware Semantic Image Transmission with Deep Learning-based Channel   Estimation in Fading Channels
**Authors**: Mahmoud M. Salim, Mohamed S. Abdalzaher, Ali H. Muqaibel, Hussein A. Elsayed, Inkyu Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:57:47Z

**Summary**: Semantic communications (SCs) play a central role in shaping the future of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, which leverage rapid advances in deep learning (DL). In this regard, end-to-end optimized DL-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been adopted to achieve SCs, particularly in image transmission. Utilizing vision transformers in the encoder/decoder design has enabled significant advancements in image semantic extraction, surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose a new JSCC paradigm for image transmission, namely Swin semantic image transmission (SwinSIT), based on the Swin transformer. The Swin transformer is employed to construct both the semantic encoder and decoder for efficient image semantic extraction and reconstruction. Inspired by the squeezing-and-excitation (SE) network, we introduce a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-aware module that utilizes SNR feedback to adaptively perform a double-phase enhancement for the encoder-extracted semantic map and its noisy version at the decoder. Additionally, a CNN-based channel estimator and compensator (CEAC) module repurposes an image-denoising CNN to mitigate fading channel effects. To optimize deployment in resource-constrained IoT devices, a joint pruning and quantization scheme compresses the SwinSIT model. Simulations evaluate the SwinSIT performance against conventional benchmarks demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, the model's compressed version substantially reduces its size while maintaining favorable PSNR performance.

### Revisiting the MIMIC-IV Benchmark: Experiments Using Language Models for   Electronic Health Records
**Authors**: Jesus Lovon, Thouria Ben-Haddi, Jules Di Scala, Jose G. Moreno, Lynda Tamine

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:49:38Z

**Summary**: The lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks in the medical domain for text inputs can be a barrier to widely adopting and leveraging the potential of natural language models for health-related downstream tasks. This paper revisited an openly available MIMIC-IV benchmark for electronic health records (EHRs) to address this issue. First, we integrate the MIMIC-IV data within the Hugging Face datasets library to allow an easy share and use of this collection. Second, we investigate the application of templates to convert EHR tabular data to text. Experiments using fine-tuned and zero-shot LLMs on the mortality of patients task show that fine-tuned text-based models are competitive against robust tabular classifiers. In contrast, zero-shot LLMs struggle to leverage EHR representations. This study underlines the potential of text-based approaches in the medical field and highlights areas for further improvement.

### Efficiency Unleashed: Inference Acceleration for LLM-based Recommender   Systems with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Yunjia Xi, Hangyu Wang, Bo Chen, Jianghao Lin, Menghui Zhu, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang, Zhewei Wei, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:43:15Z

**Summary**: The past few years have witnessed a growing interest in LLM-based recommender systems (RSs), although their industrial deployment remains in a preliminary stage. Most existing deployments leverage LLMs offline as feature enhancers, generating augmented knowledge for downstream tasks. However, in recommendation scenarios with numerous users and items, even offline knowledge generation with LLMs demands significant time and computational resources. This inefficiency arises from the autoregressive nature of LLMs. A promising solution is speculative decoding, a Draft-Then-Verify approach that increases the number of tokens generated per decoding step. In this work, we first identify recommendation knowledge generation as a highly fitting use case for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern its two characteristics: (1) the vast number of items and users in RSs leads to retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for LLM-generated text. Building on these insights, we introduce Lossless Acceleration via Speculative Decoding for LLM-based Recommender Systems (LASER), which features a Customized Retrieval Pool to enhance retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to improve the acceptance rate of draft tokens. LASER achieves a 3-5x speedup on public datasets and saves about 67\% of computational resources during the online A/B test on a large-scale advertising scenario with lossless downstream recommendation performance.

### Digital Twin-Empowered Cooperative Autonomous Car-sharing Services:   Proof-of-Concept
**Authors**: Kazuma Nonomura, Kui Wang, Zongdian Li, Tao Yu, Kei Sakaguchi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:38:30Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a digital twin-empowered real-time optimal delivery system specifically validated through a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration of a real-world autonomous car-sharing service. This study integrates real-time data from roadside units (RSUs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) within a digital twin of a campus environment to address the dynamic challenges of urban traffic. The proposed system leverages the Age of Information (AoI) metric to optimize vehicle routing by maintaining data freshness and dynamically adapting to real-time traffic conditions. Experimental results from the PoC demonstrate a 22% improvement in delivery efficiency compared to conventional shortest-path methods that do not consider information freshness. Furthermore, digital twin-based simulation results demonstrate that this proposed system improves overall delivery efficiency by 12% and effectively reduces the peak average AoI by 23% compared to the conventional method, where each vehicle selects the shortest route without considering information freshness. This study confirms the practical feasibility of cooperative driving systems, highlighting their potential to enhance smart mobility solutions through scalable digital twin deployments in complex urban environments.

### PRISM: Projection-based Reward Integration for Scene-Aware   Real-to-Sim-to-Real Transfer with Few Demonstrations
**Authors**: Haowen Sun, Han Wang, Chengzhong Ma, Shaolong Zhang, Jiawei Ye, Xingyu Chen, Xuguang Lan

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T08:01:27Z

**Summary**: Learning from few demonstrations to develop policies robust to variations in robot initial positions and object poses is a problem of significant practical interest in robotics. Compared to imitation learning, which often struggles to generalize from limited samples, reinforcement learning (RL) can autonomously explore to obtain robust behaviors. Training RL agents through direct interaction with the real world is often impractical and unsafe, while building simulation environments requires extensive manual effort, such as designing scenes and crafting task-specific reward functions. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that constructs simulation environments based on expert demonstrations by identifying scene objects from images and retrieving their corresponding 3D models from existing libraries. We introduce a projection-based reward model for RL policy training that is supervised by a vision-language model (VLM) using human-guided object projection relationships as prompts, with the policy further fine-tuned using expert demonstrations. In general, our work focuses on the construction of simulation environments and RL-based policy training, ultimately enabling the deployment of reliable robotic control policies in real-world scenarios.

### Conversations with AI Chatbots Increase Short-Term Vaccine Intentions   But Do Not Outperform Standard Public Health Messaging
**Authors**: Neil K. R. Sehgal, Sunny Rai, Manuel Tonneau, Anish K. Agarwal, Joseph Cappella, Melanie Kornides, Lyle Ungar, Alison Buttenheim, Sharath Chandra Guntuku

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T03:22:51Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.

### Distributed U6G ELAA Communication Systems: Channel Measurement and   Small-Scale Fading Characterization
**Authors**: Jiachen Tian, Zhengtao Jin, Xiayang Chen, Yu Han, Shi Jin, Wenjin Wang, Chao-Kai Wen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:57:08Z

**Summary**: The distributed upper 6 GHz (U6G) extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) is a key enabler for future wireless communication systems, offering higher throughput and wider coverage, similar to existing ELAA systems, while effectively mitigating unaffordable complexity and hardware overhead. Uncertain channel characteristics, however, present significant bottleneck problems that hinder the hardware structure and algorithm design of the distributed U6G ELAA system. In response, we construct a U6G channel sounder and carry out extensive measurement campaigns across various typical scenarios. Initially, U6G channel characteristics, particularly small-scale fading characteristics, are unveiled and compared across different scenarios. Subsequently, the U6G ELAA channel characteristics are analyzed using a virtual array comprising 64 elements. Furthermore, inspired by the potential for distributed processing, we investigate U6G ELAA channel characteristics from the perspectives of subarrays and sub-bands, including subarray-wise nonstationarities, consistencies, far-field approximations, and sub-band characteristics. Through a combination of analysis and measurement validation, several insights and benefits, particularly suitable for distributed processing in U6G ELAA systems, are revealed, which provides practical validation for the deployment of U6G ELAA systems.

### Detecting Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder based on Script-Centric   Behavior Understanding with Emotional Enhancement
**Authors**: Wenxing Liu, Yueran Pan, Dong Zhang, Hongzhu Deng, Xiaobing Zou, Ming Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:46:18Z

**Summary**: The early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critically dependent on systematic observation and analysis of children's social behaviors. While current methodologies predominantly utilize supervised learning approaches, their clinical adoption faces two principal limitations: insufficient ASD diagnostic samples and inadequate interpretability of the detection outcomes. This paper presents a novel zero-shot ASD detection framework based on script-centric behavioral understanding with emotional enhancement, which is designed to overcome the aforementioned clinical constraints. The proposed pipeline automatically converts audio-visual data into structured behavioral text scripts through computer vision techniques, subsequently capitalizing on the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot/few-shot ASD detection. Three core technical contributions are introduced: (1) A multimodal script transcription module transforming behavioral cues into structured textual representations. (2) An emotion textualization module encoding emotional dynamics as the contextual features to augment behavioral understanding. (3) A domain-specific prompt engineering strategy enables the injection of clinical knowledge into LLMs. Our method achieves an F1-score of 95.24\% in diagnosing ASD in children with an average age of two years while generating interpretable detection rationales. This work opens up new avenues for leveraging the power of LLMs in analyzing and understanding ASD-related human behavior, thereby enhancing the accuracy of assisted autism diagnosis.

### MuRAL: A Multi-Resident Ambient Sensor Dataset Annotated with Natural   Language for Activities of Daily Living
**Authors**: Xi Chen, Julien Cumin, Fano Ramparany, Dominique Vaufreydaz

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:46:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential for human activity recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors, especially through natural language reasoning and zero-shot learning. However, existing datasets such as CASAS, ARAS, and MARBLE were not originally designed with LLMs in mind and therefore lack the contextual richness, complexity, and annotation granularity required to fully exploit LLM capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MuRAL, the first Multi-Resident Ambient sensor dataset with natural Language, comprising over 21 hours of multi-user sensor data collected from 21 sessions in a smart-home environment. MuRAL is annotated with fine-grained natural language descriptions, resident identities, and high-level activity labels, all situated in dynamic, realistic multi-resident settings. We benchmark MuRAL using state-of-the-art LLMs for three core tasks: subject assignment, action description, and activity classification. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs can provide rich semantic interpretations of ambient data, current models still face challenges in handling multi-user ambiguity and under-specified sensor contexts. We release MuRAL to support future research on LLM-powered, explainable, and socially aware activity understanding in smart environments. For access to the dataset, please reach out to us via the provided contact information. A direct link for dataset retrieval will be made available at this location in due course.

### UniDetox: Universal Detoxification of Large Language Models via Dataset   Distillation
**Authors**: Huimin Lu, Masaru Isonuma, Junichiro Mori, Ichiro Sakata

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:40:00Z

**Summary**: We present UniDetox, a universally applicable method designed to mitigate toxicity across various large language models (LLMs). Previous detoxification methods are typically model-specific, addressing only individual models or model families, and require careful hyperparameter tuning due to the trade-off between detoxification efficacy and language modeling performance. In contrast, UniDetox provides a detoxification technique that can be universally applied to a wide range of LLMs without the need for separate model-specific tuning. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient dataset distillation technique for detoxification using contrastive decoding. This approach distills detoxifying representations in the form of synthetic text data, enabling universal detoxification of any LLM through fine-tuning with the distilled text. Our experiments demonstrate that the detoxifying text distilled from GPT-2 can effectively detoxify larger models, including OPT, Falcon, and LLaMA-2. Furthermore, UniDetox eliminates the need for separate hyperparameter tuning for each model, as a single hyperparameter configuration can be seamlessly applied across different models. Additionally, analysis of the detoxifying text reveals a reduction in politically biased content, providing insights into the attributes necessary for effective detoxification of LLMs.

### Large-scale visual SLAM for in-the-wild videos
**Authors**: Shuo Sun, Torsten Sattler, Malcolm Mielle, Achim J. Lilienthal, Martin Magnusson

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:37:51Z

**Summary**: Accurate and robust 3D scene reconstruction from casual, in-the-wild videos can significantly simplify robot deployment to new environments. However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.

### Token-Efficient Prompt Injection Attack: Provoking Cessation in LLM   Reasoning via Adaptive Token Compression
**Authors**: Yu Cui, Yujun Cai, Yiwei Wang

**Summary**: While reasoning large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks, they also contain notable security vulnerabilities. Recent research has uncovered a "thinking-stopped" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1, where model-generated reasoning tokens can forcibly interrupt the inference process, resulting in empty responses that compromise LLM-integrated applications. However, existing methods triggering this vulnerability require complex mathematical word problems with long prompts--even exceeding 5,000 tokens. To reduce the token cost and formally define this vulnerability, we propose a novel prompt injection attack named "Reasoning Interruption Attack", based on adaptive token compression. We demonstrate that simple standalone arithmetic tasks can effectively trigger this vulnerability, and the prompts based on such tasks exhibit simpler logical structures than mathematical word problems. We develop a systematic approach to efficiently collect attack prompts and an adaptive token compression framework that utilizes LLMs to automatically compress these prompts. Experiments show our compression framework significantly reduces prompt length while maintaining effective attack capabilities. We further investigate the attack's performance via output prefix and analyze the underlying causes of the vulnerability, providing valuable insights for improving security in reasoning LLMs.

### CCSK:Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge Based Retrieval Augmentation   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jianling Lu, Mingqi Lv, Tieming Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:33:38Z

**Summary**: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in Q&A task increased substantially through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) which brings in external knowledge. However, the main difficulty lies in balancing the inherent self-knowledge of LLMs with external information retrieval (IR). The current threshold-based methods apply one-dimensional static mechanisms with single criterion. As a result, their IR decisions might be irrelevant to the LLMs' response under difficult queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge (CCSK). Different from traditional methods that maintain single fixed IR activation criteria, CCSK implements a dynamic joint decision process via a Siamese Network module and a Response Quality Model. The Siamese Network calculates the cosine similarity between the current query and the historical queries. The Response Quality Model evaluates the responses of LLMs through LightGBM. The final decision of the CCSK is derived from the outputs of the two modules, as well as text features fused using a multi-head attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CCSK significantly enhances the model's effectiveness in information retrieval.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:28:55Z

**Summary**: MER2025 is the third year of our MER series of challenges, aiming to bring together researchers in the affective computing community to explore emerging trends and future directions in the field. Previously, MER2023 focused on multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning, while MER2024 introduced a new track dedicated to open-vocabulary emotion recognition. This year, MER2025 centers on the theme "When Affective Computing Meets Large Language Models (LLMs)".We aim to shift the paradigm from traditional categorical frameworks reliant on predefined emotion taxonomies to LLM-driven generative methods, offering innovative solutions for more accurate and reliable emotion understanding. The challenge features four tracks: MER-SEMI focuses on fixed categorical emotion recognition enhanced by semi-supervised learning; MER-FG explores fine-grained emotions, expanding recognition from basic to nuanced emotional states; MER-DES incorporates multimodal cues (beyond emotion words) into predictions to enhance model interpretability; MER-PR investigates whether emotion prediction results can improve personality recognition performance. For the first three tracks, baseline code is available at MERTools, and datasets can be accessed via Hugging Face. For the last track, the dataset and baseline code are available on GitHub.

### MEMERAG: A Multilingual End-to-End Meta-Evaluation Benchmark for   Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: María Andrea Cruz Blandón, Jayasimha Talur, Bruno Charron, Dong Liu, Saab Mansour, Marcello Federico

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:28:04Z

**Summary**: Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies on fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert human annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.   In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we apply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual automatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably identify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/MEMERAG

### Sleeping Giants -- Activating Dormant Java Deserialization Gadget Chains   through Stealthy Code Changes
**Authors**: Bruno Kreyssig, Sabine Houy, Timothée Riom, Alexandre Bartel

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:24:34Z

**Summary**: Java deserialization gadget chains are a well-researched critical software weakness. The vast majority of known gadget chains rely on gadgets from software dependencies. Furthermore, it has been shown that small code changes in dependencies have enabled these gadget chains. This makes gadget chain detection a purely reactive endeavor. Even if one dependency's deployment pipeline employs gadget chain detection, a gadget chain can still result from gadgets in other dependencies. In this work, we assess how likely small code changes are to enable a gadget chain. These changes could either be accidental or intentional as part of a supply chain attack. Specifically, we show that class serializability is a strongly fluctuating property over a dependency's evolution. Then, we investigate three change patterns by which an attacker could stealthily introduce gadgets into a dependency. We apply these patterns to 533 dependencies and run three state-of-the-art gadget chain detectors both on the original and the modified dependencies. The tools detect that applying the modification patterns can activate/inject gadget chains in 26.08% of the dependencies we selected. Finally, we verify the newly detected chains. As such, we identify dormant gadget chains in 53 dependencies that could be added through minor code modifications. This both shows that Java deserialization gadget chains are a broad liability to software and proves dormant gadget chains as a lucrative supply chain attack vector.

### Enhancing LLM Language Adaption through Cross-lingual In-Context   Pre-training
**Authors**: Linjuan Wu, Haoran Wei, Huan Lin, Tianhao Li, Baosong Yang, Weiming Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:24:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable multilingual capabilities despite English-dominated pre-training, attributed to cross-lingual mechanisms during pre-training. Existing methods for enhancing cross-lingual transfer remain constrained by parallel resources, suffering from limited linguistic and domain coverage. We propose Cross-lingual In-context Pre-training (CrossIC-PT), a simple and scalable approach that enhances cross-lingual transfer by leveraging semantically related bilingual texts via simple next-word prediction. We construct CrossIC-PT samples by interleaving semantic-related bilingual Wikipedia documents into a single context window. To access window size constraints, we implement a systematic segmentation policy to split long bilingual document pairs into chunks while adjusting the sliding window mechanism to preserve contextual coherence. We further extend data availability through a semantic retrieval framework to construct CrossIC-PT samples from web-crawled corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that CrossIC-PT improves multilingual performance on three models (Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B) across six target languages, yielding performance gains of 3.79%, 3.99%, and 1.95%, respectively, with additional improvements after data augmentation.

### Robustness via Referencing: Defending against Prompt Injection Attacks   by Referencing the Executed Instruction
**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Yuan Sui, Yue Liu, Yufei He, Yangqiu Song, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:13:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance and have come to dominate the field of natural language processing (NLP) across various tasks. However, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between instructions and data content, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. These attacks manipulate LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing maliciously injected instructions within data content, such as web documents retrieved from search engines. Existing defense methods, including prompt-engineering and fine-tuning approaches, typically instruct models to follow the original input instructions while suppressing their tendencies to execute injected instructions. However, our experiments reveal that suppressing instruction-following tendencies is challenging. Through analyzing failure cases, we observe that although LLMs tend to respond to any recognized instructions, they are aware of which specific instructions they are executing and can correctly reference them within the original prompt. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel defense method that leverages, rather than suppresses, the instruction-following abilities of LLMs. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate responses that include both answers and their corresponding instruction references. Based on these references, we filter out answers not associated with the original input instructions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prompt-engineering baselines and achieves performance comparable to fine-tuning methods, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0 percent in some scenarios. Moreover, our approach has minimal impact on overall utility.

### Investigating and Mitigating Stereotype-aware Unfairness in LLM-based   Recommendations
**Authors**: Zihuai Zhao, Wenqi Fan, Yao Wu, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:13:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented language understanding and reasoning capabilities to capture diverse user preferences and advance personalized recommendations. Despite the growing interest in LLM-based recommendations, unique challenges are brought to the trustworthiness of LLM-based recommender systems (LLM-RS). Compared to unique user/item representations in conventional recommender systems, users and items share the textual representation (e.g., word embeddings) in LLM-based recommendations. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs are likely to inherit stereotypes that are embedded ubiquitously in word embeddings, due to their training on large-scale uncurated datasets. This leads to LLM-RS exhibiting stereotypical linguistic associations between users and items, causing a form of two-sided (i.e., user-to-item) recommendation fairness. However, there remains a lack of studies investigating the unfairness of LLM-RS due to intrinsic stereotypes, which can simultaneously involve user and item groups. To bridge this gap, this study reveals a new variant of fairness between stereotype groups containing both users and items, to quantify discrimination against stereotypes in LLM-RS. Moreover, in this paper, to mitigate stereotype-aware unfairness in textual user and item representations, we propose a novel framework named Mixture-of-Stereotypes (MoS). In particular, an insightful stereotype-wise routing strategy over multiple stereotype-relevant experts is designed, aiming to learn unbiased representations against different stereotypes in LLM-RS. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of stereotype-aware fairness in LLM-RS and the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which consistently outperform competitive benchmarks under various fairness settings.

**Authors**: Enfa Fane, Mihai Surdeanu, Eduardo Blanco, Steven R. Corman

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T07:10:53Z

**Summary**: Understanding how news narratives frame entities is crucial for studying media's impact on societal perceptions of events. In this paper, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in classifying framing roles. Through systematic experimentation, we assess the effects of input context, prompting strategies, and task decomposition. Our findings show that a hierarchical approach of first identifying broad roles and then fine-grained roles, outperforms single-step classification. We also demonstrate that optimal input contexts and prompts vary across task levels, highlighting the need for subtask-specific strategies. We achieve a Main Role Accuracy of 89.4% and an Exact Match Ratio of 34.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings emphasize the importance of tailored prompt design and input context optimization for improving LLM performance in entity framing.

### A Summary on GUI Agents with Foundation Models Enhanced by Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Jiahao Li, Kaer Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T06:55:15Z

**Summary**: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), have emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling intelligent interaction with digital systems. This paper provides a structured summary of recent advances in GUI agents, focusing on architectures enhanced by Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first formalize GUI agent tasks as Markov Decision Processes and discuss typical execution environments and evaluation metrics. We then review the modular architecture of (M)LLM-based GUI agents, covering Perception, Planning, and Acting modules, and trace their evolution through representative works. Furthermore, we categorize GUI agent training methodologies into Prompt-based, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)-based, and RL-based approaches, highlighting the progression from simple prompt engineering to dynamic policy learning via RL. Our summary illustrates how recent innovations in multimodal perception, decision reasoning, and adaptive action generation have significantly improved the generalization and robustness of GUI agents in complex real-world environments. We conclude by identifying key challenges and future directions for building more capable and reliable GUI agents.

### TAMO:Fine-Grained Root Cause Analysis via Tool-Assisted LLM Agent with   Multi-Modality Observation Data
**Authors**: Qi Wang, Xiao Zhang, Mingyi Li, Yuan Yuan, Mengbai Xiao, Fuzhen Zhuang, Dongxiao Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T10:20:10Z

**Summary**: With the development of distributed systems, microservices and cloud native technologies have become central to modern enterprise software development. Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.

**Authors**: Heni Ben Amor, Laura Graesser, Atil Iscen, David D'Ambrosio, Saminda Abeyruwan, Alex Bewley, Yifan Zhou, Kamalesh Kalirathinam, Swaroop Mishra, Pannag Sanketi

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T06:39:20Z

**Summary**: We demonstrate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform iterative self-improvement of robot policies. An important insight of this paper is that LLMs have a built-in ability to perform (stochastic) numerical optimization and that this property can be leveraged for explainable robot policy search. Based on this insight, we introduce the SAS Prompt (Summarize, Analyze, Synthesize) -- a single prompt that enables iterative learning and adaptation of robot behavior by combining the LLM's ability to retrieve, reason and optimize over previous robot traces in order to synthesize new, unseen behavior. Our approach can be regarded as an early example of a new family of explainable policy search methods that are entirely implemented within an LLM. We evaluate our approach both in simulation and on a real-robot table tennis task. Project website: sites.google.com/asu.edu/sas-llm/

### Enhancing News Recommendation with Hierarchical LLM Prompting
**Authors**: Hai-Dang Kieu, Delvin Ce Zhang, Minh Duc Nguyen, Min Xu, Qiang Wu, Dung D. Le

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T06:02:16Z

**Summary**: Personalized news recommendation systems often struggle to effectively capture the complexity of user preferences, as they rely heavily on shallow representations, such as article titles and abstracts. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method, namely PNR-LLM, for Large Language Models for Personalized News Recommendation. Specifically, PNR-LLM harnesses the generation capabilities of LLMs to enrich news titles and abstracts, and consequently improves recommendation quality. PNR-LLM contains a novel module, News Enrichment via LLMs, which generates deeper semantic information and relevant entities from articles, transforming shallow contents into richer representations. We further propose an attention mechanism to aggregate enriched semantic- and entity-level data, forming unified user and news embeddings that reveal a more accurate user-news match. Extensive experiments on MIND datasets show that PNR-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the proposed data enrichment module is model-agnostic, and we empirically show that applying our proposed module to multiple existing models can further improve their performance, verifying the advantage of our design.

### Team ACK at SemEval-2025 Task 2: Beyond Word-for-Word Machine   Translation for English-Korean Pairs
**Authors**: Daniel Lee, Harsh Sharma, Jieun Han, Sunny Jeong, Alice Oh, Vered Shwartz

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T05:58:19Z

**Summary**: Translating knowledge-intensive and entity-rich text between English and Korean requires transcreation to preserve language-specific and cultural nuances beyond literal, phonetic or word-for-word conversion. We evaluate 13 models (LLMs and MT models) using automatic metrics and human assessment by bilingual annotators. Our findings show LLMs outperform traditional MT systems but struggle with entity translation requiring cultural adaptation. By constructing an error taxonomy, we identify incorrect responses and entity name errors as key issues, with performance varying by entity type and popularity level. This work exposes gaps in automatic evaluation metrics and hope to enable future work in completing culturally-nuanced machine translation.

### On Psychology of AI -- Does Primacy Effect Affect ChatGPT and Other   LLMs?
**Authors**: Mika Hämäläinen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T05:35:23Z

**Summary**: We study the primacy effect in three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. We do this by repurposing the famous experiment Asch (1946) conducted using human subjects. The experiment is simple, given two candidates with equal descriptions which one is preferred if one description has positive adjectives first before negative ones and another description has negative adjectives followed by positive ones. We test this in two experiments. In one experiment, LLMs are given both candidates simultaneously in the same prompt, and in another experiment, LLMs are given both candidates separately. We test all the models with 200 candidate pairs. We found that, in the first experiment, ChatGPT preferred the candidate with positive adjectives listed first, while Gemini preferred both equally often. Claude refused to make a choice. In the second experiment, ChatGPT and Claude were most likely to rank both candidates equally. In the case where they did not give an equal rating, both showed a clear preference to a candidate that had negative adjectives listed first. Gemini was most likely to prefer a candidate with negative adjectives listed first.

### GaLore 2: Large-Scale LLM Pre-Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection
**Authors**: DiJia Su, Andrew Gu, Jane Xu, Yuandong Tian, Jiawei Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T05:27:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation but face significant memory bottlenecks during training. GaLore, Gradient Low-Rank Projection, addresses this issue by leveraging the inherent low-rank structure of weight gradients, enabling substantial memory savings without sacrificing performance. Recent works further extend GaLore from various aspects, including low-bit quantization and higher-order tensor structures. However, there are several remaining challenges for GaLore, such as the computational overhead of SVD for subspace updates and the integration with state-of-the-art training parallelization strategies (e.g., FSDP). In this paper, we present GaLore 2, an efficient and scalable GaLore framework that addresses these challenges and incorporates recent advancements. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of GaLore 2 by pre-training Llama 7B from scratch using up to 500 billion training tokens, highlighting its potential impact on real LLM pre-training scenarios.

### Racing Thoughts: Explaining Contextualization Errors in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Michael A. Lepori, Michael C. Mozer, Asma Ghandeharioun

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T05:23:13Z

**Summary**: The profound success of transformer-based language models can largely be attributed to their ability to integrate relevant contextual information from an input sequence in order to generate a response or complete a task. However, we know very little about the algorithms that a model employs to implement this capability, nor do we understand their failure modes. For example, given the prompt "John is going fishing, so he walks over to the bank. Can he make an ATM transaction?", a model may incorrectly respond "Yes" if it has not properly contextualized "bank" as a geographical feature, rather than a financial institution. We propose the LLM Race Conditions Hypothesis as an explanation of contextualization errors of this form. This hypothesis identifies dependencies between tokens (e.g., "bank" must be properly contextualized before the final token, "?", integrates information from "bank"), and claims that contextualization errors are a result of violating these dependencies. Using a variety of techniques from mechanistic intepretability, we provide correlational and causal evidence in support of the hypothesis, and suggest inference-time interventions to address it.

### Evaluating the Symbol Binding Ability of Large Language Models for   Multiple-Choice Questions in Vietnamese General Education
**Authors**: Duc-Vu Nguyen, Quoc-Nam Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T05:18:29Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) for multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks in zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings. We focus on Vietnamese, with fewer challenging MCQA datasets than in English. The two existing datasets, ViMMRC 1.0 and ViMMRC 2.0, focus on literature. Recent research in Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) has focused on the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination (VNHSGE) from 2019 to 2023 to evaluate ChatGPT. However, these studies have mainly focused on how ChatGPT solves the VNHSGE step by step. We aim to create a novel and high-quality dataset by providing structured guidelines for typing LaTeX formulas for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. This dataset can be used to evaluate the MCSB ability of LLMs and smaller language models (LMs) because it is typed in a strict LaTeX style. We focus on predicting the character (A, B, C, or D) that is the most likely answer to a question, given the context of the question. Our evaluation of six well-known LLMs, namely BLOOMZ-7.1B-MT, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-70B, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.0, on the ViMMRC 1.0 and ViMMRC 2.0 benchmarks and our proposed dataset shows promising results on the MCSB ability of LLMs for Vietnamese. The dataset is available for research purposes only.

### Fiber to the Room: Key Technologies, Challenges, and Prospects
**Authors**: Jinhan Cai, Xiaolong Zhang, Xiang Wang, Tianhai Chang, Gangxiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T05:12:53Z

**Summary**: Fiber to the Room (FTTR) is a next-generation access network designed to deliver high bandwidth, low latency, and room-level optical coverage. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the FTTR system architecture and protocol stack, focusing on three key technical aspects: centralized scheduling and control, integrated management and maintenance, and green energy-saving mechanisms. A simplified FTTR architecture based on the convergence of the medium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers is introduced to enhance coordination and scheduling efficiency. An extended remote management scheme, based on the optical network unit management and control interface (OMCI), is described to enable unified control across main fiber units (MFUs) and sub-fiber units (SFUs). Furthermore, a service-aware energy-saving framework is discussed for dynamic power optimization. The paper also explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and passive sensing into FTTR systems to support intelligent scheduling, energy management, and environment-aware optimization. These insights provide technical guidance for the scalable deployment and future evolution of FTTR networks.

### Scideator: Human-LLM Scientific Idea Generation Grounded in   Research-Paper Facet Recombination
**Authors**: Marissa Radensky, Simra Shahid, Raymond Fok, Pao Siangliulue, Tom Hope, Daniel S. Weld

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T04:47:58Z

**Summary**: The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of existing papers to create new ideas, and facet-based ideation is an established framework for idea generation. To see how large language models (LLMs) might assist in this process, we contribute a novel mixed-initiative ideation tool called Scideator. Starting from a user-provided set of scientific papers, Scideator extracts key facets -- purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations -- from these and related papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also helps users gauge idea originality by searching the literature for overlaps, assessing idea novelty and providing explanations. To support these tasks, Scideator introduces three LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, and Idea Novelty Checker. In a within-subjects user study (N=22) with computer-science researchers comparing Scideator to a strong baseline, our tool provided significantly more creativity support, particularly with respect to exploration, which participants considered the most important factor for idea generation.

### RV-Syn: Rational and Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning Data Synthesis   based on Structured Function Library
**Authors**: Jiapeng Wang, Jinhao Jiang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T04:42:02Z

**Summary**: The advancement of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) requires substantial amounts of high-quality reasoning data, particularly in mathematics. Existing data synthesis methods, such as data augmentation from annotated training sets or direct question generation based on relevant knowledge points and documents, have expanded datasets but face challenges in mastering the inner logic of the problem during generation and ensuring the verifiability of the solutions. To address these issues, we propose RV-Syn, a novel Rational and Verifiable mathematical Synthesis approach. RV-Syn constructs a structured mathematical operation function library based on initial seed problems and generates computational graphs as solutions by combining Python-formatted functions from this library. These graphs are then back-translated into complex problems. Based on the constructed computation graph, we achieve solution-guided logic-aware problem generation. Furthermore, the executability of the computational graph ensures the verifiability of the solving process. Experimental results show that RV-Syn surpasses existing synthesis methods, including those involving human-generated problems, achieving greater efficient data scaling. This approach provides a scalable framework for generating high-quality reasoning datasets.

**Summary**: Automation in agriculture plays a vital role in addressing challenges related to crop monitoring and disease management, particularly through early detection systems. This study investigates the effectiveness of combining multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated plant disease classification using leaf imagery. Leveraging the PlantVillage dataset, we systematically evaluate model performance across zero-shot, few-shot, and progressive fine-tuning scenarios. A comparative analysis between GPT-4o and the widely used ResNet-50 model was conducted across three resolutions (100, 150, and 256 pixels) and two plant species (apple and corn). Results indicate that fine-tuned GPT-4o models achieved slightly better performance compared to the performance of ResNet-50, achieving up to 98.12% classification accuracy on apple leaf images, compared to 96.88% achieved by ResNet-50, with improved generalization and near-zero training loss. However, zero-shot performance of GPT-4o was significantly lower, underscoring the need for minimal training. Additional evaluations on cross-resolution and cross-plant generalization revealed the models' adaptability and limitations when applied to new domains. The findings highlight the promise of integrating multimodal LLMs into automated disease detection pipelines, enhancing the scalability and intelligence of precision agriculture systems while reducing the dependence on large, labeled datasets and high-resolution sensor infrastructure.

**Summary**: Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) enables efficient search capabilities over encrypted data, allowing users to maintain privacy while utilizing cloud storage. However, SSE schemes are vulnerable to leakage attacks that exploit access patterns, search frequency, and volume information. Existing studies frequently assume that adversaries possess a substantial fraction of the encrypted dataset to mount effective inference attacks, implying there is a database leakage of such documents, thus, an assumption that may not hold in real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of enhancing leakage attacks under a more realistic threat model in which adversaries have access to minimal leaked data. We propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 variants, to generate synthetic documents that statistically and semantically resemble the real-world dataset of Enron emails. Using the email corpus as a case study, we evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data generated via random sampling and hierarchical clustering methods on the performance of the SAP (Search Access Pattern) keyword inference attack restricted to token volumes only. Our results demonstrate that, while the choice of LLM has limited effect, increasing dataset size and employing clustering-based generation significantly improve attack accuracy, achieving comparable performance to attacks using larger amounts of real data. We highlight the growing relevance of LLMs in adversarial contexts.
