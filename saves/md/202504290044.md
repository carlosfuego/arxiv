 ### Constructing Hamiltonian Decompositions of Complete $k$-Uniform   Hypergraphs
**Authors**: Javad Maheri, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:45:36Z

**Summary**: Motivated by the wide-ranging applications of Hamiltonian decompositions in distributed computing, coded caching, routing, resource allocation, load balancing, and fault tolerance, our work presents a comprehensive design for Hamiltonian decompositions of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs $K_n^k$. Building upon the resolution of the long-standing conjecture of the existence of Hamiltonian decompositions of complete hypergraphs, a problem that was resolved using existence-based methods, our contribution goes beyond the previous explicit designs, which were confined to the specific cases of $k=2$ and $k=3$, by providing explicit designs for all $k$ and $n$ prime, allowing for a broad applicability of Hamiltonian decompositions in various settings.

### FlexiNS: A SmartNIC-Centric, Line-Rate and Flexible Network Stack
**Authors**: Xuzheng Chen, Jie Zhang, Baolin Zhu, Xueying Zhu, Zhongqing Chen, Shu Ma, Lingjun Zhu, Chao Shi, Yin Zhang, Zeke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:44:38Z

**Summary**: As the gap between network and CPU speeds rapidly increases, the CPU-centric network stack proves inadequate due to excessive CPU and memory overhead. While hardware-offloaded network stacks alleviate these issues, they suffer from limited flexibility in both control and data planes. Offloading network stack to off-path SmartNIC seems promising to provide high flexibility; however, throughput remains constrained by inherent SmartNIC architectural limitations.   To this end, we design FlexiNS, a SmartNIC-centric network stack with software transport programmability and line-rate packet processing capabilities. To grapple with the limitation of SmartNIC-induced challenges, FlexiNS introduces: (a) a header-only offloading TX path; (b) an unlimited-working-set in-cache processing RX path; (c) a high-performance DMA-only notification pipe; and (d) a programmable offloading engine. We prototype FlexiNS using Nvidia BlueField-3 SmartNIC and provide out-of-the-box RDMA IBV verbs compatibility to users. FlexiNS achieves 2.2$\times$ higher throughput than the microkernel-based baseline in block storage disaggregation and 1.3$\times$ higher throughput than the hardware-offloaded baseline in KVCache transfer.

### Demand Private Coded Caching: Small Cache Size
**Authors**: Qinyi Lu, Nan Liu, Wei Kang, Chunguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:43:23Z

**Summary**: We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands, i.e., each user can not gain any information about the demands of other users. We focus on scenarios where the size of users' caches is small, aiming to further characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files, and two MDS-code-based achievable schemes for the case $N \le K$. With a newly derived converse bound for the case $N \le K$, these proposed schemes lead to the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for $M \in \big[0, \frac{N}{(K+1)(N-1)} \big] $ where $N \le K \le 2N-2$, and the optimal memory-rate tradeoff for $M \in \big[0, \frac{1}{K+1} \big] $ where $ K > 2N-2$. Moreover, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, by deriving another new converse bound, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in \big[0,\frac{2}{K}\big] \cup \big[\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2\big]$. Finally, we provide the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users.

### Efficient GNN Training Through Structure-Aware Randomized Mini-Batching
**Authors**: Vignesh Balaji, Christos Kozyrakis, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:16:53Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:08:45Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). That is, C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup. This is so, due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build concurrent communication collectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation   temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$
**Authors**: Haoran Liu, Shaofeng Duan, Xiangqi Liu, Zhihua Liu, Shichong Wang, Lingxiao Gu, Jiongyu Huang, Wenxuan Yang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Yanfeng Guo, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:05:49Z

**Summary**: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

### From Cluster to Desktop: A Cache-Accelerated INR framework for   Interactive Visualization of Tera-Scale Data
**Authors**: Daniel Zavorotny, Qi Wu, David Bauer, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:10:49Z

**Summary**: Machine learning has enabled the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) to efficiently compress and reconstruct massive scientific datasets. However, despite advances in fast INR rendering algorithms, INR-based rendering remains computationally expensive, as computing data values from an INR is significantly slower than reading them from GPU memory. This bottleneck currently restricts interactive INR visualization to professional workstations. To address this challenge, we introduce an INR rendering framework accelerated by a scalable, multi-resolution GPU cache capable of efficiently representing tera-scale datasets. By minimizing redundant data queries and prioritizing novel volume regions, our method reduces the number of INR computations per frame, achieving an average 5x speedup over the state-of-the-art INR rendering method while still maintaining high visualization quality. Coupled with existing hardware-accelerated INR compressors, our framework enables scientists to generate and compress massive datasets in situ on high-performance computing platforms and then interactively explore them on consumer-grade hardware post hoc.

### Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A   first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study
**Authors**: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Sayandeep Ghosh, Bongjae Kim, Chang-Jong Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:41:43Z

**Summary**: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

**Authors**: L. Paulucci, F. Cavanna, V. Vale, F. Marinho

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T18:09:25Z

**Summary**: The need for a microscopic description of scintillation light generation in liquid argon becomes increasingly desirable with the upcoming operation of large scale LArTPCs in the next decade. While a detailed mathematical account of the process is still to be achieved, a phenomenological model for simultaneously treating ionization and scintillation, LArQL, has been successfully employed to describe the range of electric fields from 0 to 0.75 kV/cm and dE/dx from 2 to 40 MeV/cm providing the anti-correlation between the free ionization charge and scintillation light. A reanalysis of the original model parameter values has been performed within a global fit procedure and is presented.

### L3: DIMM-PIM Integrated Architecture and Coordination for Scalable   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Qingyuan Liu, Liyan Chen, Yanning Yang, Haocheng Wang, Dong Du, Zhigang Mao, Naifeng Jing, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T14:14:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.   Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.

### Rethinking PM Crash Consistency in the CXL Era
**Authors**: João Oliveira, João Gonçalves, Miguel Matos

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T13:47:35Z

**Summary**: Persistent Memory (PM) introduces new opportunities for designing crash-consistent applications without the traditional storage overheads. However, ensuring crash consistency in PM demands intricate knowledge of CPU, cache, and memory interactions. Hardware and software mechanisms have been proposed to ease this burden, but neither proved sufficient, prompting a variety of bug detection tools.   With the sunset of Intel Optane comes the rise of Compute Express Link (CXL) for PM. In this position paper, we discuss the impact of CXL's disaggregated and heterogeneous nature in the development of crash-consistent PM applications, and outline three research directions: hardware primitives, persistency frameworks, and bug detection tools.

### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T08:39:13Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device.   In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system.   However, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.

### SPAARC: Spatial Proximity and Association based prefetching for   Augmented Reality in edge Cache
**Authors**: Nikhil Sreekumar, Abhishek Chandra, Jon Weissman

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T04:36:20Z

**Summary**: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

### Efficient Pretraining Length Scaling
**Authors**: Bohong Wu, Shen Yan, Sijun Zhang, Jianqiao Lu, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Xun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T04:13:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

### Cognitive Memory in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lianlei Shan, Shixian Luo, Zezhou Zhu, Yu Yuan, Yong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T01:47:25Z

**Summary**: This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

### KeyDiff: Key Similarity-Based KV Cache Eviction for Long-Context LLM   Inference in Resource-Constrained Environments
**Authors**: Junyoung Park, Dalton Jones, Matt J Morse, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T18:02:55Z

**Summary**: In this work, we demonstrate that distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. We explore this phenomenon and propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based on key similarity. This method facilitates the deployment of LLM-based application requiring long input prompts in resource-constrained environments with limited memory and compute budgets. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We demonstrate that KeyDiff computes the optimal solution to a KV cache selection problem that maximizes key diversity, providing a theoretical understanding of KeyDiff. Notably,KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff across diverse tasks and models, illustrating a performance gap of less than 0.04\% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$ 23\% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on the LongBench benchmark for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B.

### Iris: A Next Generation Digital Pathology Rendering Engine
**Authors**: Ryan Erik Landvater, Ulysses Balis

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T15:02:16Z

**Summary**: Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.

### The NIC should be part of the OS
**Authors**: Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T10:48:52Z

**Summary**: The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a cloud server occupying a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to efficient operation of the machine, but unlike compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency.   Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path.   However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernelbypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

### CAOTE: KV Caching through Attention Output Error based Token Eviction
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T05:04:58Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### ML-based Adaptive Prefetching and Data Placement for US HEP Systems
**Authors**: Venkat Sai Suman Lamba Karanam, Sarat Sasank Barla, Byrav Ramamurthy, Derek Weitzel

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T04:21:49Z

**Summary**: Although benefits from caching in US HEP are well-known, current caching strategies are not adaptive i.e they do not adapt to changing cache access patterns. Newer developments such as the High-Luminosity - Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a steady move toward streaming readout based Data Acquisition systems (DAQs) will increase the data production exponentially and hence burden the storage, compute & network infrastructures. Moreover, existing caching frameworks are optimized to reduce latency, but not optimized for storage. This, in combination with limited cache capacities relative to total data, makes it difficult to achieve data locality.   In this work, we present Machine Learning-aided (ML) caching strategies. Specifically, we first present a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) hourly and multi-step cache usage prediction. Second, we present an hourly file-level access prediction model based on CatboostRegressor. To date, most ML-based cache prediction strategies in HEP have focused on daily cache usage and limited works tackled hourly cache usage and even fewer strategies addressed hourly file-level access prediction. File-level access prediction allows for the design of intelligent prefetching and data placement strategies with fine-grained control. We validated our cache prediction strategies using data collected from SoCal MINI caches in August 2024. We are currently extending the WRENCH simulator to reflect the US HEP ecosystem at the storage, network and compute levels. We plan to deploy our cache prediction strategies into WRENCH and later perform extensive analysis with complex data access patterns and candidate infrastructure configurations.

### The Dawn of Disaggregation and the Coherence Conundrum: A Call for   Federated Coherence
**Authors**: Jaewan Hong, Marcos K. Aguilera, Emmanuel Amaro, Vincent Liu, Aurojit Panda, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T23:52:13Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory is an upcoming data center technology that will allow nodes (servers) to share data efficiently. Sharing data creates a debate on the level of cache coherence the system should provide. While current proposals aim to provide coherence for all or parts of the disaggregated memory, we argue that this approach is problematic, because of scalability limitations and hardware complexity. Instead, we propose and formally define federated coherence, a model that provides coherence only within nodes, not across nodes. Federated coherence can use current intra-node coherence provided by processors without requiring expensive mechanisms for inter-node coherence. Developers can use federated coherence with a few simple programming paradigms and a synchronization library. We sketch some potential applications.

**Authors**: Neusha Javidnia, Bita Darvish Rouhani, Farinaz Koushanfar

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T17:34:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

### GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous   On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Cheng Jiajun, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T17:23:28Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.

### Optimizing SLO-oriented LLM Serving with PD-Multiplexing
**Authors**: Weihao Cui, Yukang Chen, Han Zhao, Ziyi Xu, Quan Chen, Xusheng Chen, Yangjie Zhou, Shixuan Sun, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T15:19:48Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM services demand high throughput and stringent SLO guarantees across two distinct inference phases-prefill and decode-and complex multi-turn workflows. However, current systems face a fundamental tradeoff: out-of-place compute partition enables per-phase SLO attainment, while in-place memory sharing maximizes throughput via KV cache reuse. Moreover, existing in-place compute partition also encounters low utilization and high overhead due to phase-coupling design. We present Drift, a new LLM serving framework that resolves this tension via PD multiplexing, enabling in-place and phase-decoupled compute partition. Drift leverages low-level GPU partitioning techniques to multiplex prefill and decode phases spatially and adaptively on shared GPUs, while preserving in-place memory sharing. To fully leverage the multiplexing capability, Drift introduces an adaptive gang scheduling mechanism, a contention-free modeling method, and a SLO-aware dispatching policy. Evaluation shows that Drift achieves an average $5.1\times$ throughput improvement (up to $17.5\times$) over state-of-the-art baselines, while consistently meeting SLO targets under complex LLM workloads.

### SeaLLM: Service-Aware and Latency-Optimized Resource Sharing for Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Yihao Zhao, Jiadun Chen, Peng Sun, Lei Li, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T09:08:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with different architectures and sizes have been developed. Serving each LLM with dedicated GPUs leads to resource waste and service inefficiency due to the varying demand of LLM requests. A common practice is to share multiple LLMs. However, existing sharing systems either do not consider the autoregressive pattern of LLM services, or only focus on improving the throughput, which impairs the sharing performance, especially the serving latency. We present SeaLLM, which enables service-aware and latency-optimized LLM sharing. SeaLLM improves the overall sharing performance by (1) a latency-optimized scheduling algorithm utilizing the characteristics of LLM services, (2) a placement algorithm to determine the placement plan and an adaptive replacement algorithm to decide the replacement interval, and (3) a unified key-value cache to share GPU memory among LLM services efficiently. Our evaluation under real-world traces and LLM services demonstrates that SeaLLM improves the normalized latency by up to $13.60\times$, the tail latency by up to $18.69\times$, and the SLO attainment by up to $3.64\times$ compared to existing solutions.

### Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory   Controller Design
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T22:13:07Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

**Authors**: Zihao Ye, Lequn Chen, Ruihang Lai, Wuwei Lin, Yineng Zhang, Stephanie Wang, Tianqi Chen, Baris Kasikci, Vinod Grover, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Luis Ceze

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T20:10:11Z

**Summary**: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

### Joint Knowledge and Power Management for Secure Semantic Communication   Networks
**Authors**: Xuesong Liu, Yansong Liu, Haoyu Tang, Fangzhou Zhao, Le Xia, Yao Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:39:59Z

**Summary**: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks.

### Lance: Efficient Random Access in Columnar Storage through Adaptive   Structural Encodings
**Authors**: Weston Pace, Chang She, Lei Xu, Will Jones, Albert Lockett, Jun Wang, Raunak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:22:18Z

**Summary**: The growing interest in artificial intelligence has created workloads that require both sequential and random access. At the same time, NVMe-backed storage solutions have emerged, providing caching capability for large columnar datasets in cloud storage. Current columnar storage libraries fall short of effectively utilizing an NVMe device's capabilities, especially when it comes to random access. Historically, this has been assumed an implicit weakness in columnar storage formats, but this has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of popular columnar formats such as Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Lance in both random access and full scan tasks against NVMe storage.   We argue that effective encoding of a column's structure, such as the repetition and validity information, is the key to unlocking the disk's performance. We show that Parquet, when configured correctly, can achieve over 60x better random access performance than default settings. We also show that this high random access performance requires making minor trade-offs in scan performance and RAM utilization. We then describe the Lance structural encoding scheme, which alternates between two different structural encodings based on data width, and achieves better random access performance without making trade-offs in scan performance or RAM utilization.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:36:53Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:13:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Is Intelligence the Right Direction in New OS Scheduling for Multiple   Resources in Cloud Environments?
**Authors**: Xinglei Dou, Lei Liu, Limin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:09:43Z

**Summary**: Making it intelligent is a promising way in System/OS design. This paper proposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located cloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory bandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources simultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during its scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource cliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling policies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge faster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically learn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using transfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various cloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our experimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower overheads than previous studies.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:40:10Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

### gLLM: Global Balanced Pipeline Parallelism System for Distributed LLM   Serving with Token Throttling
**Authors**: Tianyu Guo, Xianwei Zhang, Jiangsu Du, Zhiguang Chen, Nong Xiao, Yutong Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T00:07:49Z

**Summary**: Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

**Authors**: Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya, Hanjiang Wu, Suvinay Subramanian, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Midhilesh Elavazhagan, Madhu Kumar, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T19:57:16Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

### Slice+Slice Baby: Generating Last-Level Cache Eviction Sets in the Blink   of an Eye
**Authors**: Bradley Morgan, Gal Horowitz, Sioli O'Connell, Stephan van Schaik, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Daniel Genkin, Olaf Maennel, Paul Montague, Eyal Ronen, Yuval Yarom

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T07:53:09Z

**Summary**: An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

### Deuteronomy 2.0: Record Caching and Latch Freedom
**Authors**: David Lomet

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T00:49:27Z

**Summary**: The Deuteronomy transactional key-value store is unique architecturally in providing separation between transaction functionality -- its Transactional Component (TC) and data management -- its Data Component (DC). It is unique in technology by (1) supporting record caching, a smaller unit than the traditional page; and (2) protecting resources during concurrent execution using a latch-free approach. Both technologies are enabled by delta updating. This paper explains how record caching improves cache cost/performance. It also shows how a new latch-free approach makes implementation easier and improves performance.

### A fast MPI-based Distributed Hash-Table as Surrogate Model demonstrated   in a coupled reactive transport HPC simulation
**Authors**: Max Lübke, Marco De Lucia, Stefan Petri, Bettina Schnor

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T18:25:20Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

### Room-temperature high-average-power strong-field terahertz source based   on industrial high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser
**Authors**: Deyin Kong, Yichen Su, Cheng Song, Xiaojun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T06:18:56Z

**Summary**: Free-space strong-field terahertz (THz) pulses, generated via optical rectification of femtosecond lasers in nonlinear crystals, are pivotal in various applications. However, conventional Ti:sapphire lasers struggle to produce high-average-power THz due to their limited output power. While kilowatt ytterbium lasers are increasingly adopted, their application in THz generation faces challenges: low optical-to-THz conversion efficiency (attributed to long pulse durations and low energy) and crystal damage under high pumping power. Here, we report a high-average-power strong-field THz source using a lithium niobate crystal pumped by a 1030-nm, 570-fs, 1-mJ, 50-kHz ytterbium femtosecond laser with tilted pulse front pumping (TPFP). By systematically optimizing TPFP implementations and comparing grating- and echelon-type configurations, we achieve a THz source with 64.5 mW average power at 42-W, 50-kHz pumping, and a focused peak electric field of 525 kV/cm at 0.83-mJ, 1-kHz operation. Additionally, we observe Zeeman torque signals in cobalt-iron ferromagnetic nanofilms. This high-repetition-rate, high-average-power THz system, combined with its potential capabilities in high signal-to-noise spectroscopy and imaging, promises transformative impacts in quantum matter manipulation, non-destructive testing, and biomedicine.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T05:57:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

**Authors**: Lucas Maisonnave, Cyril Moineau, Olivier Bichler, Fabrice Rastello

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:46:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in artificial intelligence, demonstrating strong capabilities in reasoning, understanding, and generating data. However, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by their substantial size, often reaching several billion parameters. Quantization is a widely used method to reduce memory usage and inference time, however LLMs present unique challenges due to the prevalence of outliers in their activations. In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization in LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing outliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization. Our method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40\% increase in accuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of rotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to the Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically demonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We achieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache, significantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple models family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit quantization.

### CacheFormer: High Attention-Based Segment Caching
**Authors**: Sushant Singh, Ausif Mahmood

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:34:57Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts in transformer-based language models with low perplexity is an active area of research. Numerous recent approaches like Linformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs)., have not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss in quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by the cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache miss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent data is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by dividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments in an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the compressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include aggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window attention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k high attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment attention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an architecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average perplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes.

**Authors**: Amit Kumar Bhuyan, Hrishikesh Dutta, Subir Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:13:52Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

**Authors**: Myunghyun Rhee, Joonseop Sim, Taeyoung Ahn, Seungyong Lee, Daegun Yoon, Euiseok Kim, Kyoung Park, Youngpyo Joo, Hosik Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T03:31:08Z

**Summary**: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.

### EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for   Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks
**Authors**: Tianhong Xu, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T00:21:00Z

**Summary**: Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim's activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T23:45:51Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T19:40:54Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction
**Authors**: Yuchao Gu, Weijia Mao, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T15:26:04Z

**Summary**: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling. The code is released at https://github.com/showlab/FAR.

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T03:51:06Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T00:38:24Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MOM: Memory-Efficient Offloaded Mini-Sequence Inference for Long Context   Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Tianyi Zhu, Cheng Luo, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T23:15:09Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T18:03:21Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

### Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References
**Authors**: Junhao Zhuang, Lingen Li, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T16:45:19Z

**Summary**: The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

**Authors**: Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Hyunsun Chung, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T07:02:38Z

**Summary**: LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

### Efficient Architecture for RISC-V Vector Memory Access
**Authors**: Hongyi Guan, Yichuan Gao, Chenlu Miao, Haoyang Wu, Hang Zhu, Mingfeng Lin, Huayue Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T05:57:08Z

**Summary**: Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.

### Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference   in RAG-Powered LLMs
**Authors**: Hyungwoo Lee, Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Jungmin So, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, James J. Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T04:59:18Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

### EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G   Networks
**Authors**: Jiahong Ning, Pengyan Zhu, Ce Zheng, Gary Lee, Sumei Sun, Tingting Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T03:07:07Z

**Summary**: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

### Engineering MultiQueues: Fast Relaxed Concurrent Priority Queues
**Authors**: Marvin Williams, Peter Sanders

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T22:38:54Z

**Summary**: Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including prioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy algorithms. In parallel settings, classical priority queues often become a severe bottleneck, resulting in low throughput. Consequently, there has been significant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In this article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed priority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The scalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching operations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high cache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank error, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and delay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given element. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue outperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes shortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications. Moreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and quality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly paradoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest for converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data structures.

### Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory   Constraints
**Authors**: Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T16:00:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:40:25Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

**Authors**: Junjie Li, Yinzhi Wang, Xiao Liang, Hang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:37:58Z

**Summary**: Porting codes to GPU often requires major efforts. While several tools exist for automatically offload numerical libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK, they often prove impractical due to the high cost of mandatory data transfer. The new unified memory architecture in NVIDIA Grace-Hopper allows high bandwidth cache-coherent memory access of all memory from both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating bottleneck faced in conventional architecture. This breakthrough opens up new avenues for application development and porting strategies. In this study, we introduce a new tool for automatic BLAS offload, the tool leverages the high speed cache coherent NVLink C2C interconnect in Grace-Hopper, and enables performant GPU offload for BLAS heavy applications with no code changes or recompilation. The tool was tested on two quantum chemistry or physics codes, great performance benefits were observed.

### Morphing-based Compression for Data-centric ML Pipelines
**Authors**: Sebastian Baunsgaard, Matthias Boehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T11:02:34Z

**Summary**: Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines -- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input data. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression schemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but struggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed operations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O across the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction parallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature transformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics such as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this paper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless matrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations and engineering to leverage information about structural transformations. Besides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for lightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized compressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial end-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training data-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:34:26Z

**Summary**: AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.

### Shield Bash: Abusing Defensive Coherence State Retrieval to Break Timing   Obfuscation
**Authors**: Kartik Ramkrishnan, Antonia Zhai, Stephen McCamant, Pen Chung Yew

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.

### A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis
**Authors**: Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T12:34:20Z

**Summary**: The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

### Diversity in Network-Friendly Recommendations
**Authors**: Evangelia Tzimpimpaki, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T11:20:56Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

### On Precomputation and Caching in Information Retrieval Experiments with   Pipeline Architectures
**Authors**: Sean MacAvaney, Craig Macdonald

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T08:51:35Z

**Summary**: Modern information retrieval systems often rely on multiple components executed in a pipeline. In a research setting, this can lead to substantial redundant computations (e.g., retrieving the same query multiple times for evaluating different downstream rerankers). To overcome this, researchers take cached "result" files as inputs, which represent the output of another pipeline. However, these result files can be brittle and can cause a disconnect between the conceptual design of the pipeline and its logical implementation. To overcome both the redundancy problem (when executing complete pipelines) and the disconnect problem (when relying on intermediate result files), we describe our recent efforts to improve the caching capabilities in the open-source PyTerrier IR platform. We focus on two main directions: (1) automatic implicit caching of common pipeline prefixes when comparing systems and (2) explicit caching of operations through a new extension package, pyterrier-caching. These approaches allow for the best of both worlds: pipelines can be fully expressed end-to-end, while also avoiding redundant computations between pipelines.

### Secrecy and Privacy in Multi-Access Combinatorial Topology
**Authors**: Mallikharjuna Chinnapadamala, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T07:30:03Z

**Summary**: In this work, we consider the multi-access combinatorial topology with $C$ caches where each user accesses a unique set of $r$ caches. For this setup, we consider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it did not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept private from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when $r\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for $r<C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \textit{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and demand privacy conditions.

### KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLMs Inference
**Authors**: Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T06:58:00Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

### Plato: Plan to Efficiently Decode for Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Yongji Wu, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Atul Prakash, Matthew Lentz, Danyang Zhuo, Feng Qian, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.

### Efficient LLM Serving on Hybrid Real-time and Best-effort Requests
**Authors**: Wan Borui, Zhao Juntao, Jiang Chenyu, Guo Chuanxiong, Wu Chuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:16:57Z

**Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.

### Block-Attention for Efficient Prefilling
**Authors**: Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:02:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.

### AB-Cache: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via   Adams-Bashforth Cached Feature Reuse
**Authors**: Zichao Yu, Zhen Zou, Guojiang Shao, Chengwei Zhang, Shengze Xu, Jie Huang, Feng Zhao, Xiaodong Cun, Wenyi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T08:29:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.

### Sub-nanosecond in-plane magnetization switching induced by field-like   spin-orbit torques from ferromagnets
**Authors**: Hanying Zhang, Ziqian Cui, Baiqing Jiang, Yuan Wang, C. Bi

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T04:46:02Z

**Summary**: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated in SOT-material/ferromagnet structures are classified as damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques for current-driven magnetization switching. It is well known that both DL- and FL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven switching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an incubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching with the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a FL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT, and demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We show that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one order of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because of no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL switching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with one order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching. These results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution for magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.

### Head-Aware KV Cache Compression for Efficient Visual Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Zeren Zhang, Danping Zou, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-12T15:42:17Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have emerged as a powerful approach for multi-modal content creation, offering high efficiency and quality across diverse multimedia applications. However, they face significant memory bottlenecks due to extensive KV cache accumulation during inference. Existing KV cache compression techniques for large language models are suboptimal for VAR models due to, as we identify in this paper, two distinct categories of attention heads in VAR models: Structural Heads, which preserve spatial coherence through diagonal attention patterns, and Contextual Heads, which maintain semantic consistency through vertical attention patterns. These differences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware Compression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and employs pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential characteristics of each head category. Experiments on Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B, and VAR-d30 demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image and class-conditional generation tasks. HACK can hack down up to 50\% and 70\% of cache with minimal performance degradation for VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, respectively. Even with 70\% and 90\% KV cache compression in VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, HACK still maintains high-quality generation while reducing memory usage by 44.2\% and 58.9\%, respectively.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T12:31:07Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### Scaling Up On-Device LLMs via Active-Weight Swapping Between DRAM and   Flash
**Authors**: Fucheng Jia, Zewen Wu, Shiqi Jiang, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianxi Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Yunxin Liu, Ju Ren, Deyu Zhang, Ting Cao

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T09:26:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

### II-NVM: Enhancing Map Accuracy and Consistency with Normal   Vector-Assisted Mapping
**Authors**: Chengwei Zhao, Yixuan Li, Yina Jian, Jie Xu, Linji Wang, Yongxin Ma, Xinglai Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:10:02Z

**Summary**: SLAM technology plays a crucial role in indoor mapping and localization. A common challenge in indoor environments is the "double-sided mapping issue", where closely positioned walls, doors, and other surfaces are mistakenly identified as a single plane, significantly hindering map accuracy and consistency. To address this issue this paper introduces a SLAM approach that ensures accurate mapping using normal vector consistency. We enhance the voxel map structure to store both point cloud data and normal vector information, enabling the system to evaluate consistency during nearest neighbor searches and map updates. This process distinguishes between the front and back sides of surfaces, preventing incorrect point-to-plane constraints. Moreover, we implement an adaptive radius KD-tree search method that dynamically adjusts the search radius based on the local density of the point cloud, thereby enhancing the accuracy of normal vector calculations. To further improve realtime performance and storage efficiency, we incorporate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy, which facilitates efficient incremental updates of the voxel map. The code is released as open-source and validated in both simulated environments and real indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the "double-sided mapping issue" and significantly improves mapping precision. Additionally, we have developed and open-sourced the first simulation and real world dataset specifically tailored for the "double-sided mapping issue".

### Boosting Universal LLM Reward Design through Heuristic Reward   Observation Space Evolution
**Authors**: Zen Kit Heng, Zimeng Zhao, Tianhao Wu, Yuanfei Wang, Mingdong Wu, Yangang Wang, Hao Dong

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:05:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at jingjjjjjie.github.io/LLM2Reward.

**Authors**: Dibyadip Chatterjee, Edoardo Remelli, Yale Song, Bugra Tekin, Abhay Mittal, Bharat Bhatnagar, Necati Cihan Camgöz, Shreyas Hampali, Eric Sauser, Shugao Ma, Angela Yao, Fadime Sener

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T17:13:08Z

**Summary**: We introduce ProVideLLM, an end-to-end framework for real-time procedural video understanding. ProVideLLM integrates a multimodal cache configured to store two types of tokens - verbalized text tokens, which provide compressed textual summaries of long-term observations, and visual tokens, encoded with DETR-QFormer to capture fine-grained details from short-term observations. This design reduces token count by 22x over existing methods in representing one hour of long-term observations while effectively encoding fine-granularity of the present. By interleaving these tokens in our multimodal cache, ProVideLLM ensures sub-linear scaling of memory and compute with video length, enabling per-frame streaming inference at 10 FPS and streaming dialogue at 25 FPS, with a minimal 2GB GPU memory footprint. ProVideLLM also sets new state-of-the-art results on six procedural tasks across four datasets.

**Authors**: Georgeta Bordea, Stephane Campinas, Matteo Catena, Renaud Delbru

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T14:52:03Z

**Summary**: Investigative workflows require interactive exploratory analysis on large heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Current databases show limitations in enabling such task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system that efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging document-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include distributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding, semantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join decomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in path-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency and scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of computing nodes.

### Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based   Program Analysis
**Authors**: Rustam Sadykov, Azat Abdullin, Marat Akhin

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T10:43:42Z

**Summary**: Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.

### Apt-Serve: Adaptive Request Scheduling on Hybrid Cache for Scalable LLM   Inference Serving
**Authors**: Shihong Gao, Xin Zhang, Yanyan Shen, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T06:51:23Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference serving systems are essential to various LLM-based applications. As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling these systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical. However, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput, primarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO attainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1) memory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory constraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default First-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce Apt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM inference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state vectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on the hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism that dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive scheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and LLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up to 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.

### UniCAIM: A Unified CAM/CIM Architecture with Static-Dynamic KV Cache   Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Weikai Xu, Wenxuan Zeng, Qianqian Huang, Meng Li, Ru Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T06:13:30Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the inference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory (CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache pruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a fixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer from either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory (CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous support for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM mode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for dynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain CIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity score, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the current-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset of selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that leverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage of the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP) by 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit level, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the application level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM inference.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T05:06:29Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### MAGNUS: Generating Data Locality to Accelerate Sparse Matrix-Matrix   Multiplication on CPUs
**Authors**: Jordi Wolfson-Pou, Jan Laukemann, Fabrizio Petrini

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T21:47:31Z

**Summary**: Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines, including Intel MKL, for a variety of different matrices on three Intel architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is often an order of magnitude faster than at least one baseline. For massive random matrices, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines do not. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T20:51:08Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models. The code is available at https://github.com/tensorgi/T6.

### Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention
**Authors**: Gleb Rodionov, Roman Garipov, Alina Shutova, George Yakushev, Vage Egiazarian, Anton Sinitsin, Denis Kuznedelev, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T17:56:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

### Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yao Tao, Yehui Tang, Yun Wang, Mingjian Zhu, Hailin Hu, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T14:36:19Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

### Introducing the Arm-membench Throughput Benchmark
**Authors**: Cyrill Burth, Markus Velten, Robert Schöne

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T12:07:26Z

**Summary**: Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the memory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data throughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance and determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction throughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the achievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and compute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well established x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support all current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We describe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable design of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem at a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three processors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the resulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder widths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads due to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.

### Optimizing LLM Queries in Relational Data Analytics Workloads
**Authors**: Shu Liu, Asim Biswal, Amog Kamsetty, Audrey Cheng, Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Liana Patel, Shiyi Cao, Xiangxi Mo, Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Matei Zaharia

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T10:23:39Z

**Summary**: Batch data analytics is a growing application for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large datasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second, taking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data costs around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational data analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient algorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input table to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As such, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and serving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x improvement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries using Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under OpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.

### MemoRAG: Boosting Long Context Processing with Global Memory-Enhanced   Retrieval Augmentation
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Kelong Mao, Defu Lian, Zhicheng Dou, Tiejun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T09:09:37Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements allow LLMs to handle much longer contexts than before (e.g., 32K or 128K tokens), it is computationally expensive and can still be insufficient for many applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered a promising strategy to address this problem. However, conventional RAG methods face inherent limitations because of two underlying requirements: 1) explicitly stated queries, and 2) well-structured knowledge. These conditions, however, do not hold in general long-context processing tasks.   In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel RAG framework empowered by global memory-augmented retrieval. MemoRAG features a dual-system architecture. First, it employs a light but long-range system to create a global memory of the long context. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, providing useful clues for the retrieval tools to locate relevant information within the long context. Second, it leverages an expensive but expressive system, which generates the final answer based on the retrieved information. Building upon this fundamental framework, we realize the memory module in the form of KV compression, and reinforce its memorization and cluing capacity from the Generation quality's Feedback (a.k.a. RLGF). In our experiments, MemoRAG achieves superior performances across a variety of long-context evaluation tasks, not only complex scenarios where traditional RAG methods struggle, but also simpler ones where RAG is typically applied.

### Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T07:55:43Z

**Summary**: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

### GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for   Dynamic Graph Processing
**Authors**: Hongfu Li, Qian Tao, Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Yanfeng Zhang, Feng Yao, Wenyuan Yu, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T03:49:16Z

**Summary**: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

### SPIRe: Boosting LLM Inference Throughput with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Sanjit Neelam, Daniel Heinlein, Vaclav Cvicek, Akshay Mishra, Reiner Pope

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T20:39:20Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) has been shown to reduce the latency of autoregressive decoding (AD) by 2-3x for small batch sizes. However, increasing throughput and therefore reducing the cost per token requires decoding with large batch sizes. Recent work shows that SD can accelerate decoding with large batch sizes too if the context is sufficiently long and the draft model's KV cache is sparse. We introduce SPIRe, a draft model that combines static sparse attention, pruned initialization, and feedback memory to increase the modeled throughput of speculative decoding by over 100% compared to speculation with a much smaller draft model and by over 35% compared to the strong baseline of sparse self-speculation. Our approach is particularly effective when context lengths vary significantly across requests.

### Unifying Autoregressive and Diffusion-Based Sequence Generation
**Authors**: Nima Fathi, Torsten Scholak, Pierre-André Noël

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T20:32:10Z

**Summary**: We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

### Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for   Laplace's Equation
**Authors**: Michael Czekanski, Benjamin Faber, Margaret Fairborn, Adelle Wright, David Bindel

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T19:26:41Z

**Summary**: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.

### GPU-accelerated Evolutionary Many-objective Optimization Using   Tensorized NSGA-III
**Authors**: Hao Li, Zhenyu Liang, Ran Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T14:09:23Z

**Summary**: NSGA-III is one of the most widely adopted algorithms for tackling many-objective optimization problems. However, its CPU-based design severely limits scalability and computational efficiency. To address the limitations, we propose {TensorNSGA-III}, a fully tensorized implementation of NSGA-III that leverages GPU parallelism for large-scale many-objective optimization. Unlike conventional GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms that rely on heuristic approximations to improve efficiency, TensorNSGA-III maintains the exact selection and variation mechanisms of NSGA-III while achieving significant acceleration. By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data structures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively eliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and na\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical benchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\times$ over the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness in multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and high-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical role of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate the scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### TRACE Back from the Future: A Probabilistic Reasoning Approach to   Controllable Language Generation
**Authors**: Gwen Yidou Weng, Benjie Wang, Guy Van den Broeck

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:59:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead, adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly extends to composite attributes.

**Authors**: Nima Karimipour, Kanak Das, Manu Sridharan, Behnaz Hassanshahi

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:53:52Z

**Summary**: Many important security properties can be formulated in terms of flows of tainted data, and improved taint analysis tools to prevent such flows are of critical need. Most existing taint analyses use whole-program static analysis, leading to scalability challenges. Type-based checking is a promising alternative, as it enables modular and incremental checking for fast performance. However, type-based approaches have not been widely adopted in practice, due to challenges with false positives and annotating existing codebases. In this paper, we present a new approach to type-based checking of taint properties that addresses these challenges, based on two key techniques. First, we present a new type-based tainting checker with significantly reduced false positives, via more practical handling of third-party libraries and other language constructs. Second, we present a novel technique to automatically infer tainting type qualifiers for existing code. Our technique supports inference of generic type argument annotations, crucial for tainting properties. We implemented our techniques in a tool TaintTyper and evaluated it on real-world benchmarks. TaintTyper exceeds the recall of a state-of-the-art whole-program taint analyzer, with comparable precision, and 2.93X-22.9X faster checking time. Further, TaintTyper infers annotations comparable to those written by hand, suitable for insertion into source code. TaintTyper is a promising new approach to efficient and practical taint checking.

### Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Guided Test-Time   Sampling
**Authors**: Yuejiang Liu, Jubayer Ibn Hamid, Annie Xie, Yoonho Lee, Maximilian Du, Chelsea Finn

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:27:10Z

**Summary**: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its effects on the learned policy remain inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity to unexpected states. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop adaptation. At each timestep, BID samples multiple candidate predictions and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes both long-term consistency and short-term reactivity. Experimental results show that our method boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Code and videos are available at https://bid-robot.github.io.

### Examining the Impact of Optical Aberrations to Image Classification and   Object Detection Models
**Authors**: Patrick Müller, Alexander Braun, Margret Keuper

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:23:47Z

**Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations. Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models, the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly, indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a model's robustness against blur.

### DeSIA: Attribute Inference Attacks Against Limited Fixed Aggregate   Statistics
**Authors**: Yifeng Mao, Bozhidar Stevanoski, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:10:33Z

**Summary**: Empirical inference attacks are a popular approach for evaluating the privacy risk of data release mechanisms in practice. While an active attack literature exists to evaluate machine learning models or synthetic data release, we currently lack comparable methods for fixed aggregate statistics, in particular when only a limited number of statistics are released. We here propose an inference attack framework against fixed aggregate statistics and an attribute inference attack called DeSIA. We instantiate DeSIA against the U.S. Census PPMF dataset and show it to strongly outperform reconstruction-based attacks. In particular, we show DeSIA to be highly effective at identifying vulnerable users, achieving a true positive rate of 0.14 at a false positive rate of $10^{-3}$. We then show DeSIA to perform well against users whose attributes cannot be verified and when varying the number of aggregate statistics and level of noise addition. We also perform an extensive ablation study of DeSIA and show how DeSIA can be successfully adapted to the membership inference task. Overall, our results show that aggregation alone is not sufficient to protect privacy, even when a relatively small number of aggregates are being released, and emphasize the need for formal privacy mechanisms and testing before aggregate statistics are released.

### Facets, Taxonomies, and Syntheses: Navigating Structured Representations   in LLM-Assisted Literature Review
**Authors**: Raymond Fok, Joseph Chee Chang, Marissa Radensky, Pao Siangliulue, Jonathan Bragg, Amy X. Zhang, Daniel S. Weld

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:09:29Z

**Summary**: Comprehensive literature review requires synthesizing vast amounts of research -- a labor intensive and cognitively demanding process. Most prior work focuses either on helping researchers deeply understand a few papers (e.g., for triaging or reading), or retrieving from and visualizing a vast corpus. Deep analysis and synthesis of large paper collections (e.g., to produce a survey paper) is largely conducted manually with little support. We present DimInd, an interactive system that scaffolds literature review across large paper collections through LLM-generated structured representations. DimInd scaffolds literature understanding with multiple levels of compression, from papers, to faceted literature comparison tables with information extracted from individual papers, to taxonomies of concepts, to narrative syntheses. Users are guided through these successive information transformations while maintaining provenance to source text. In an evaluation with 23 researchers, DimInd supported participants in extracting information and conceptually organizing papers with less effort compared to a ChatGPT-assisted baseline workflow.

### Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse
**Authors**: George Drayson, Emine Yilmaz, Vasileios Lampos

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:53:47Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present. We release our code at https://github.com/GeorgeDrayson/model_collapse.

### Investigating Co-Constructive Behavior of Large Language Models in   Explanation Dialogues

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:47:44Z

**Summary**: The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

### A Picture is Worth A Thousand Numbers: Enabling LLMs Reason about Time   Series via Visualization
**Authors**: Haoxin Liu, Chenghao Liu, B. Aditya Prakash

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:39:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), with demonstrated reasoning abilities across multiple domains, are largely underexplored for time-series reasoning (TsR), which is ubiquitous in the real world. In this work, we propose TimerBed, the first comprehensive testbed for evaluating LLMs' TsR performance. Specifically, TimerBed includes stratified reasoning patterns with real-world tasks, comprehensive combinations of LLMs and reasoning strategies, and various supervised models as comparison anchors. We perform extensive experiments with TimerBed, test multiple current beliefs, and verify the initial failures of LLMs in TsR, evidenced by the ineffectiveness of zero shot (ZST) and performance degradation of few shot in-context learning (ICL). Further, we identify one possible root cause: the numerical modeling of data. To address this, we propose a prompt-based solution VL-Time, using visualization-modeled data and language-guided reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Vl-Time enables multimodal LLMs to be non-trivial ZST and powerful ICL reasoners for time series, achieving about 140% average performance improvement and 99% average token costs reduction.

### FoC: Figure out the Cryptographic Functions in Stripped Binaries with   LLMs
**Authors**: Xiuwei Shang, Guoqiang Chen, Shaoyin Cheng, Shikai Guo, Yanming Zhang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:39:40Z

**Summary**: Analyzing the behavior of cryptographic functions in stripped binaries is a challenging but essential task. Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection. Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries. In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoC-BinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language. The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches. To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database. In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain. And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions. Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score. FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.

### Magnetic field orientation dependence of continuous-wave optically   detected magnetic resonance with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles
**Authors**: Pralekh Dubey, Shashank Kumar, Chinmaya Singh, Jemish Naliyapara, Monish A Poojar, Harikrishnan K B, Anshul Poonia, Phani Peddibhotla

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:36:27Z

**Summary**: Continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) measurements with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins in diamond are used for sensing DC magnetic fields from nearby magnetic targets. However, this technique suffers from ambiguities in the extraction of the magnetic field components when resonances due to different NV orientation classes overlap with each other. Here, we perform detailed experimental and theoretical studies of such effects on NV ensembles experiencing low bias magnetic fields. In particular, through symmetry considerations, we systematically examine the ODMR response of different NV orientation classes as a function of the orientation of the magnetic field vector. Our studies are of importance for performing a careful and detailed analysis of the ODMR spectra in order to infer the vector magnetic field information. Our results find application in the studies of magnetic samples that require a low applied bias field and also can be potentially adapted to defect spins in other solid-state systems.

### Generative Induction of Dialogue Task Schemas with Streaming Refinement   and Simulated Interactions
**Authors**: James D. Finch, Yasasvi Josyula, Jinho D. Choi

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:29:45Z

**Summary**: In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, Slot Schema Induction (SSI) is essential for automatically identifying key information slots from dialogue data without manual intervention. This paper presents a novel state-of-the-art (SoTA) approach that formulates SSI as a text generation task, where a language model incrementally constructs and refines a slot schema over a stream of dialogue data. To develop this approach, we present a fully automatic LLM-based TOD simulation method that creates data with high-quality state labels for novel task domains. Furthermore, we identify issues in SSI evaluation due to data leakage and poor metric alignment with human judgment. We resolve these by creating new evaluation data using our simulation method with human guidance and correction, as well as designing improved evaluation metrics. These contributions establish a foundation for future SSI research and advance the SoTA in dialogue understanding and system development.

### ElChat: Adapting Chat Language Models Using Only Target Unlabeled   Language Data
**Authors**: Atsuki Yamaguchi, Terufumi Morishita, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:08:57Z

**Summary**: Vocabulary expansion (VE) is the de-facto approach to language adaptation of large language models (LLMs) by adding new tokens and continuing pre-training on target data. While this is effective for base models trained on unlabeled data, it poses challenges for chat models trained to follow instructions through labeled conversation data. Directly adapting the latter with VE on target unlabeled data may result in forgetting chat abilities. While ideal, target chat data is often unavailable or costly to create for low-resource languages, and machine-translated alternatives are not always effective. To address this issue, previous work proposed using a base and chat model from the same family. This method first adapts the base LLM with VE on target unlabeled data and then converts it to a chat model by adding a chat vector (CV) derived from the weight difference between the source base and chat models. We propose ElChat, a new language adaptation method for chat LLMs that adapts a chat model directly on target unlabeled data, without a base model. It elicits chat abilities by injecting information from the source chat model. ElChat offers more robust and competitive target language and safety performance while achieving superior English, chat, and instruction-following abilities compared to CV.

### Structured Bayesian Regression Tree Models for Estimating Distributed   Lag Effects: The R Package dlmtree
**Authors**: Seongwon Im, Ander Wilson, Daniel Mork

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:03:34Z

**Summary**: When examining the relationship between an exposure and an outcome, there is often a time lag between exposure and the observed effect on the outcome. A common statistical approach for estimating the relationship between the outcome and lagged measurements of exposure is a distributed lag model (DLM). Because repeated measurements are often autocorrelated, the lagged effects are typically constrained to vary smoothly over time. A recent statistical development on the smoothing constraint is a tree structured DLM framework. We present an R package dlmtree, available on CRAN, that integrates tree structured DLM and extensions into a comprehensive software package with user-friendly implementation. A conceptual background on tree structured DLMs and demonstration of the fitting process of each model using simulated data are provided. We also demonstrate inference and interpretation using the fitted models, including summary and visualization. Additionally, a built-in shiny app for heterogeneity analysis is included.

### Efficient Budget Allocation for Large-Scale LLM-Enabled Virtual   Screening
**Authors**: Zaile Li, Weiwei Fan, L. Jeff Hong

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:59:19Z

**Summary**: Screening tasks that aim to identify a small subset of top alternatives from a large pool are common in business decision-making processes. These tasks often require substantial human effort to evaluate each alternative's performance, making them time-consuming and costly. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their ability to generate outputs that align well with human evaluations, we consider an LLM-as-human-evaluator approach for conducting screening virtually, thereby reducing the cost burden. To achieve scalability and cost-effectiveness in virtual screening, we identify that the stochastic nature of LLM outputs and their cost structure necessitate efficient budget allocation across all alternatives. To address this, we propose using a top-$m$ greedy evaluation mechanism, a simple yet effective approach that keeps evaluating the current top-$m$ alternatives, and design the explore-first top-$m$ greedy (EFG-$m$) algorithm. We prove that EFG-$m$ is both sample-optimal and consistent in large-scale virtual screening. Surprisingly, we also uncover a bonus ranking effect, where the algorithm naturally induces an indifference-based ranking within the selected subset. To further enhance practicality, we design a suite of algorithm variants to improve screening performance and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments validate our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. Lastly, we conduct a case study on LLM-based virtual screening. The study shows that while LLMs alone may not provide meaningful screening and ranking results when directly queried, integrating them with our sample-optimal algorithms unlocks their potential for cost-effective, large-scale virtual screening.

### Pseudo-Boolean Proof Logging for Optimal Classical Planning
**Authors**: Simon Dold, Malte Helmert, Jakob Nordström, Gabriele Röger, Tanja Schindler

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:54:09Z

**Summary**: We introduce lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can be used to prove the unsolvability of a task or the optimality of a plan in a way that can be verified by an independent third party. We describe a general framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on pseudo-Boolean constraints, which is agnostic to the planning algorithm used.   As a case study, we show how to modify the $A^{*}$ algorithm to produce proofs of optimality with modest overhead, using pattern database heuristics and $h^\textit{max}$ as concrete examples. The same proof logging approach works for any heuristic whose inferences can be efficiently expressed as reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints.

### The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Avner Seror

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:47:33Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40 leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning, but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.

### Robust Binding Energy Distribution Sampling on Amorphous Solid Water   Models. Method testing and validation with NH3, CO and CH4
**Authors**: Maria Groyne, Benoît Champagne, Cedric Baijot, Michaël De Becker

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:45:54Z

**Summary**: This work aims to develop a method based on a structurally reliable ice model and a statistically and physico-chemically robust approach for BE distribution inference, with the aim to be applicable to various relevant interstellar species. A multiscale computational approach is presented, with a Molecular Dynamics (MD) Heat & Quench protocol for the amorphous water ice model, and an ONIOM(B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G**:GFN2-xtb) scheme for the BE inference, with a prime emphasis onto the BE/real system size convergence. The sampling of the binding configurations is twofold, exploring both regularly spaced binding sites, as well as various adsorbate-to-substrate orientations on each locally distinct site. This second source of BE diversity accounts for the local roughness of the potential energy landscape of the substrate. Three different adsorbate test cases are considered, i.e. NH3, CO and CH4, owing to their significance in dust icy mantles, and their distinct binding behavior with water ices. The BE distributions for NH3, CO and CH4 have been inferred, with converged statistics. The distribution for NH3 is better represented by a double Gaussian component profile. Three starting adsorbate orientations per site are required to reach convergence for both Gaussian components of NH3, while 2 orientations are sufficient for CO, and one unique for CH4 (symmetric). Further geometrical and molecular surrounding insights have been provided. These results encompass previously reported results.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:39:04Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30% accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance, especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

### Redefining Superalignment: From Weak-to-Strong Alignment to Human-AI   Co-Alignment to Sustainable Symbiotic Society
**Authors**: Yi Zeng, Feifei Zhao, Yuwei Wang, Enmeng Lu, Yaodong Yang, Lei Wang, Chao Liu, Yitao Liang, Dongcheng Zhao, Bing Han, Haibo Tong, Yao Liang, Dongqi Liang, Kang Sun, Boyuan Chen, Jinyu Fan

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:32:41Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly powerful and autonomous, and may progress to surpass human intelligence levels, namely Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). During the progression from AI to ASI, it may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the Self, others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and for a symbiotic ecology.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:31:46Z

**Summary**: We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that excels in audio understanding, generation, and conversation. We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio.

### LLMpatronous: Harnessing the Power of LLMs For Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Rajesh Yarra

**Summary**: Despite the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various sectors, cyber security continues to rely on traditional static and dynamic analysis tools, hampered by high false positive rates and superficial code comprehension. While generative AI offers promising automation capabilities for software development, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection presents unique challenges. This paper explores the potential and limitations of LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities, acknowledging inherent weaknesses such as hallucinations, limited context length, and knowledge cut-offs. Previous attempts employing machine learning models for vulnerability detection have proven ineffective due to limited real-world applicability, feature engineering challenges, lack of contextual understanding, and the complexities of training models to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. Therefore, we propose a robust AI-driven approach focused on mitigating these limitations and ensuring the quality and reliability of LLM based vulnerability detection. Through innovative methodologies combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Mixtureof-Agents (MoA), this research seeks to leverage the strengths of LLMs while addressing their weaknesses, ultimately paving the way for dependable and efficient AI-powered solutions in securing the ever-evolving software landscape.

### CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization
**Authors**: Tom Zehle, Moritz Schlager, Timo Heiß, Matthias Feurer

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:27:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.

### The cosmic evolution of FRBs inferred from CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog 1
**Authors**: Om Gupta, Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar, Steven L. Finkelstein

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:24:44Z

**Summary**: Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $> 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. The furthest FRB detection with planned radio facilities is expected to be at $z \approx 5$. A radio telescope operating at 200 MHz with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 0.07$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 1 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 400$ square degrees should be able to detect $630^{+730}_{-485}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $53^{+83}_{-43}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.

**Authors**: Ayushi Mishra, Yang Bai, Priyadarshan Narayanasamy, Nakul Garg, Nirupam Roy

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:21:54Z

**Summary**: Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.

### BitNet v2: Native 4-bit Activations with Hadamard Transformation for   1-bit LLMs
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:17:52Z

**Summary**: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2 achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for batched inference.

### Expressing stigma and inappropriate responses prevents LLMs from safely   replacing mental health providers
**Authors**: Jared Moore, Declan Grabb, William Agnew, Kevin Klyman, Stevie Chancellor, Desmond C. Ong, Nick Haber

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:14:21Z

**Summary**: Should a large language model (LLM) be used as a therapist? In this paper, we investigate the use of LLMs to *replace* mental health providers, a use case promoted in the tech startup and research space. We conduct a mapping review of therapy guides used by major medical institutions to identify crucial aspects of therapeutic relationships, such as the importance of a therapeutic alliance between therapist and client. We then assess the ability of LLMs to reproduce and adhere to these aspects of therapeutic relationships by conducting several experiments investigating the responses of current LLMs, such as `gpt-4o`. Contrary to best practices in the medical community, LLMs 1) express stigma toward those with mental health conditions and 2) respond inappropriately to certain common (and critical) conditions in naturalistic therapy settings -- e.g., LLMs encourage clients' delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy. This occurs even with larger and newer LLMs, indicating that current safety practices may not address these gaps. Furthermore, we note foundational and practical barriers to the adoption of LLMs as therapists, such as that a therapeutic alliance requires human characteristics (e.g., identity and stakes). For these reasons, we conclude that LLMs should not replace therapists, and we discuss alternative roles for LLMs in clinical therapy.

### Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling via Simulation-Calibrated   Scientific Machine Learning
**Authors**: Zexi Fan, Yan Sun, Shihao Yang, Yiping Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:12:10Z

**Summary**: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant computational challenges across fields ranging from quantum chemistry to economics and finance. Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.

### Can Code Outlove Blood? A LLM-based VR Experience to Prompt Reflection   on Parental Verbal Abuse
**Authors**: Jiaying Fu, Jialin Gu, Tianyue Gong, Tiange Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:10:51Z

**Summary**: Parental verbal abuse leaves lasting emotional impacts, yet current therapeutic approaches often lack immersive self-reflection opportunities. To address this, we developed a VR experience powered by LLMs to foster reflection on parental verbal abuse. Participants with relevant experiences engage in a dual-phase VR experience: first assuming the role of a verbally abusive parent, interacting with an LLM portraying a child, then observing the LLM reframing abusive dialogue into warm, supportive expressions as a nurturing parent. A qualitative study with 12 participants showed that the experience encourages reflection on their past experiences and fosters supportive emotions. However, these effects vary with participants' personal histories, emphasizing the need for greater personalization in AI-driven emotional support. This study explores the use of LLMs in immersive environment to promote emotional reflection, offering insights into the design of AI-driven emotional support systems.

### DeepDistill: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities via Large-Scale   Difficulty-Graded Data Training
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Tian, Sitong Zhao, Haotian Wang, Shuaiting Chen, Yiping Peng, Yunjie Ji, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:10:20Z

**Summary**: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-Distilled-40M

### Bridge the Domains: Large Language Models Enhanced Cross-domain   Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Qidong Liu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yejing Wang, Zijian Zhang, Howard Zhong, Chong Chen, Xiang Li, Wei Huang, Feng Tian

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:30:25Z

**Summary**: Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference from the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some progress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e., overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by bridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view. Therefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation model (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose an LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a trainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR task. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize user cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into the proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the effectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.

### Spatial Reasoner: A 3D Inference Pipeline for XR Applications
**Authors**: Steven Häsler, Philipp Ackermann

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:27:27Z

**Summary**: Modern extended reality XR systems provide rich analysis of image data and fusion of sensor input and demand AR/VR applications that can reason about 3D scenes in a semantic manner. We present a spatial reasoning framework that bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on', 'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model, enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client- and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR applications.

### Pushing the boundary on Natural Language Inference
**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:20:57Z

**Summary**: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.

### Auto-SLURP: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Multi-Agent Frameworks in   Smart Personal Assistant
**Authors**: Lei Shen, Xiaoyu Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:17:47Z

**Summary**: In recent years, multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly. Despite this progress, there is still a notable absence of benchmark datasets specifically tailored to evaluate their performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Auto-SLURP, a benchmark dataset aimed at evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks in the context of intelligent personal assistants. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset -- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services. This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline, covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remain a work in progress. The dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/lorashen/Auto-SLURP/.

### ThreMoLIA: Threat Modeling of Large Language Model-Integrated   Applications
**Authors**: Felix Viktor Jedrzejewski, Davide Fucci, Oleksandr Adamov

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:11:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently being integrated into industrial software applications to help users perform more complex tasks in less time. However, these LLM-Integrated Applications (LIA) expand the attack surface and introduce new kinds of threats. Threat modeling is commonly used to identify these threats and suggest mitigations. However, it is a time-consuming practice that requires the involvement of a security practitioner. Our goals are to 1) provide a method for performing threat modeling for LIAs early in their lifecycle, (2) develop a threat modeling tool that integrates existing threat models, and (3) ensure high-quality threat modeling. To achieve the goals, we work in collaboration with our industry partner. Our proposed way of performing threat modeling will benefit industry by requiring fewer security experts' participation and reducing the time spent on this activity. Our proposed tool combines LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses sources such as existing threat models and application architecture repositories to continuously create and update threat models. We propose to evaluate the tool offline -- i.e., using benchmarking -- and online with practitioners in the field. We conducted an early evaluation using ChatGPT on a simple LIA and obtained results that encouraged us to proceed with our research efforts.

### Rapid wavefront shaping using an optical gradient acquisition
**Authors**: Sagi Monin, Marina Alterman, Anat Levin

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:41:38Z

**Summary**: Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.

### Characterizing the Impact of Alfvén Wave Forcing in Interplanetary   Space on the Distribution of near-Earth Solar Wind Speeds
**Authors**: B. L. Alterman

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:40:25Z

**Summary**: Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\'en wave energy deposition and thermal pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously identify source region topology.   Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to the continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\'en wave forcing during the solar wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's Alfv\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source regions because the Alfv\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in transit is a consequence of the source region topology.

### Revisiting Data Auditing in Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Hongyu Zhu, Sichu Liang, Wenwen Wang, Boheng Li, Tongxin Yuan, Fangqi Li, ShiLin Wang, Zhuosheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:38:23Z

**Summary**: With the surge of large language models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)--which integrate vision encoders with LLMs for accurate visual grounding--have shown great potential in tasks like generalist agents and robotic control. However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations, and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%). In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions, performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts, and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible. Our study presents a systematic view of the limits and opportunities of MI for VLMs, providing guidance for future efforts in trustworthy data auditing.

### Comparing Uncertainty Measurement and Mitigation Methods for Large   Language Models: A Systematic Review
**Authors**: Toghrul Abbasli, Kentaroh Toyoda, Yuan Wang, Leon Witt, Muhammad Asif Ali, Yukai Miao, Dan Li, Qingsong Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:34:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

### Using Causal Inference to Test Systems with Hidden and Interacting   Variables: An Evaluative Case Study
**Authors**: Michael Foster, Robert M. Hierons, Donghwan Shin, Neil Walkinshaw, Christopher Wild

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:32:24Z

**Summary**: Software systems with large parameter spaces, nondeterminism and high computational cost are challenging to test. Recently, software testing techniques based on causal inference have been successfully applied to systems that exhibit such characteristics, including scientific models and autonomous driving systems. One significant limitation is that these are restricted to test properties where all of the variables involved can be observed and where there are no interactions between variables. In practice, this is rarely guaranteed; the logging infrastructure may not be available to record all of the necessary runtime variable values, and it can often be the case that an output of the system can be affected by complex interactions between variables. To address this, we leverage two additional concepts from causal inference, namely effect modification and instrumental variable methods. We build these concepts into an existing causal testing tool and conduct an evaluative case study which uses the concepts to test three system-level requirements of CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator widely used in autonomous vehicle development and testing. The results show that we can obtain reliable test outcomes without requiring large amounts of highly controlled test data or instrumentation of the code, even when variables interact with each other and are not recorded in the test data.

**Summary**: Chemical synthesis, as a foundational methodology in the creation of transformative molecules, exerts substantial influence across diverse sectors from life sciences to materials and energy. Current chemical synthesis practices emphasize laborious and costly trial-and-error workflows, underscoring the urgent need for advanced AI assistants. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs), typified by GPT-4, have been introduced as an efficient tool to facilitate scientific research. Here, we present Chemma, a fully fine-tuned LLM with 1.28 million pairs of Q&A about reactions, as an assistant to accelerate organic chemistry synthesis. Chemma surpasses the best-known results in multiple chemical tasks, e.g., single-step retrosynthesis and yield prediction, which highlights the potential of general AI for organic chemistry. Via predicting yields across the experimental reaction space, Chemma significantly improves the reaction exploration capability of Bayesian optimization. More importantly, integrated in an active learning framework, Chemma exhibits advanced potential for autonomous experimental exploration and optimization in open reaction spaces. For an unreported Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of cyclic aminoboronates and aryl halides for the synthesis of $\alpha$-Aryl N-heterocycles, the human-AI collaboration successfully explored suitable ligand and solvent (1,4-dioxane) within only 15 runs, achieving an isolated yield of 67%. These results reveal that, without quantum-chemical calculations, Chemma can comprehend and extract chemical insights from reaction data, in a manner akin to human experts. This work opens avenues for accelerating organic chemistry synthesis with adapted large language models.

### SSD-Poser: Avatar Pose Estimation with State Space Duality from Sparse   Observations
**Authors**: Shuting Zhao, Linxin Bai, Liangjing Shao, Ye Zhang, Xinrong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:18:06Z

**Summary**: The growing applications of AR/VR increase the demand for real-time full-body pose estimation from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Although HMDs provide joint signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency, showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### EPO: Explicit Policy Optimization for Strategic Reasoning in LLMs via   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yongbin Li, Yuchuan Wu, Wentao Ma, Aobo Kong, Fei Huang, Jianbin Jiao, Junge Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:03:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications. Code and data are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/EPO.

### STP4D: Spatio-Temporal-Prompt Consistent Modeling for Text-to-4D   Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Yunze Deng, Haijun Xiong, Bin Feng, Xinggang Wang, Wenyu Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:53:15Z

**Summary**: Text-to-4D generation is rapidly developing and widely applied in various scenarios. However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.

### Towards Adaptive Software Agents for Debugging
**Authors**: Yacine Majdoub, Eya Ben Charrada, Haifa Touati

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:48:08Z

**Summary**: Using multiple agents was found to improve the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models. However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.

### StoryGPT-V: Large Language Models as Consistent Story Visualizers
**Authors**: Xiaoqian Shen, Mohamed Elhoseiny

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:47:21Z

**Summary**: Recent generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating realistic and visually pleasing images grounded on textual prompts. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption. Our code is publicly available at: \href{https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/StoryGPT-V}{https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/StoryGPT-V}.

### Generative Evaluation of Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haowei Lin, Xiangyu Wang, Ruilin Yan, Baizhou Huang, Haotian Ye, Jianhua Zhu, Zihao Wang, James Zou, Jianzhu Ma, Yitao Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:02:19Z

**Summary**: With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

### LEAM: A Prompt-only Large Language Model-enabled Antenna Modeling Method
**Authors**: Tao Wu, Kexue Fu, Qiang Hua, Xinxin Liu, Muhammad Ali Imran, Bo Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:29:30Z

**Summary**: Antenna modeling is a time-consuming and complex process, decreasing the speed of antenna analysis and design. In this paper, a large language model (LLM)- enabled antenna modeling method, called LEAM, is presented to address this challenge. LEAM enables automatic antenna model generation based on language descriptions via prompt input, images, descriptions from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple). The effectiveness of LEAM is demonstrated by three examples: a Vivaldi antenna generated from a complete user description, a slotted patch antenna generated from an incomplete user description and the operating frequency, and a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions scanned from the literature. For all the examples, correct antenna models are generated in a few minutes. The code can be accessed via https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM.

### TextTIGER: Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity Prompt   Refinement for Text-to-Image Generation
**Authors**: Shintaro Ozaki, Kazuki Hayashi, Yusuke Sakai, Jingun Kwon, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Manabu Okumura, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:27:44Z

**Summary**: Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub (WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available upon acceptance.

Schreiner, C. Schwertner, K. Shera, M. Stahlberg, A. Stendahl, M. Stukel, C. Tresca, F. Wagner, S. Yue, V. Zema, Y. Zhu, The COSINUS Collaboration

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:17:46Z

**Summary**: COSINUS is a dark matter direct detection experiment using NaI crystals as cryogenic scintillating calorimeters. If no signal is observed, this will constrain the dark matter scattering rate in sodium iodide. We investigate how this constraint can be used to infer that the annual modulation signal observed in DAMA/LIBRA experiment cannot originate from dark matter nuclear recoil events, independent of the DM model. We achieve this by unfolding the DAMA modulation spectrum to obtain the implied unquenched nuclear recoil spectrum, which we compare to the expected COSINUS sensitivity. We find that assuming zero background in the signal region, a 1$\sigma$, 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$ confidence limit exclusion can be obtained with 57, 130 or 250 kg day of exposure, respectively.

### Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Disentanglement for Task-Oriented   Semantic Communications
**Authors**: Omar Erak, Omar Alhussein, Wen Tong

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:17:27Z

**Summary**: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and subpar performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the lack of reliable and reproducible methods to gain insight into the informativeness and minimality of the encoded feature vectors, we introduce a new technique to compute the information retention index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input, reflecting the minimality of the encoded features. The IRI quantifies the minimality and informativeness of the encoded feature vectors across different task-oriented communication techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI. CLAD achieves a predictive performance improvement of around 2.5-3%, along with a 77-90% reduction in IRI and a 57-76% decrease in adversarial attribute inference attack accuracy.

### Review-driven Personalized Preference Reasoning with Large Language   Models for Recommendation
**Authors**: Jieyong Kim, Hyunseo Kim, Hyunjin Cho, SeongKu Kang, Buru Chang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:10:43Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.

**Authors**: Guanqun Bi, Zhuang Chen, Zhoufu Liu, Hongkai Wang, Xiyao Xiao, Yuqiang Xie, Wen Zhang, Yongkang Huang, Yuxuan Chen, Libiao Peng, Yi Feng, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:08:27Z

**Summary**: Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable reasoning.

### Generating ensembles of spatially-coherent in-situ forecasts using flow   matching
**Authors**: David Landry, Claire Monteleoni, Anastase Charantonis

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:00:15Z

**Summary**: We propose a machine-learning-based methodology for in-situ weather forecast postprocessing that is both spatially coherent and multivariate. Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.

### Multilingual Large Language Models and Curse of Multilinguality
**Authors**: Daniil Gurgurov, Tanja Bäumel, Tatiana Anikina

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:53:27Z

**Summary**: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained large popularity among Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers and practitioners. These models, trained on huge datasets, show proficiency across various languages and demonstrate effectiveness in numerous downstream tasks. This paper navigates the landscape of multilingual LLMs, providing an introductory overview of their technical aspects. It explains underlying architectures, objective functions, pre-training data sources, and tokenization methods. This work explores the unique features of different model types: encoder-only (mBERT, XLM-R), decoder-only (XGLM, PALM, BLOOM, GPT-3), and encoder-decoder models (mT5, mBART). Additionally, it addresses one of the significant limitations of multilingual LLMs - the curse of multilinguality - and discusses current attempts to overcome it.

### Efficient Single-Pass Training for Multi-Turn Reasoning
**Authors**: Ritesh Goru, Shanay Mehta, Prateek Jain

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:46:56Z

**Summary**: Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on multi-turn reasoning datasets.

### An e-MERLIN & EVN radio counterpart to the ultraluminous X-ray source   M82 X-1
**Authors**: D. Williams-Baldwin, T. W. B. Muxlow, G. Lucatelli, R. J. Beswick

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:58:33Z

**Summary**: Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray bright (L$_{\rm X-ray} >$3$\times$10$^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$) extra-galactic objects that are powered by either neutron stars, or stellar or intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) but few have been detected in the radio waveband. In the nearby galaxy M82, the brightest ULX - M82 X$-$1, is thought to be associated with an IMBH but to date does not have a radio counterpart. We present deep wide-band reprocessed e-MERLIN images observed in 2015 May with an r.m.s. sensitivity of 7$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and report the discovery of a new radio source with an integrated flux of S$_{\rm \nu=4.88\,GHz}$ = 174$\pm$15$\mu$Jy, which is spatially co-incident with the Chandra X-ray position of M82 X$-$1. This source is not detected in archival MERLIN/e-MERLIN observations in the last three decades. A search for intra-observation variability in the 2015 e-MERLIN data was inconclusive, but a comparison with 1.5 GHz e-MERLIN observations taken a week prior yielded no detection. We also detect the source at the same position with milliarcsecond angular resolution in EVN+e-MERLIN data from 2021 March at 53$\pm$10$\mu$Jy. The radio source position is ICRF J2000 RA: 09$^{h}$55$^{m}$50.1172$^{s}$, Dec: +69$^{\circ}$40'46.606" ($\pm$1.5 mas). These radio fluxes are consistent with other radio-detected ULXs on the radio:X-ray plane and points towards a stellar/intermediate-mass black hole. The black hole mass inferred by the `fundamental plane of black hole activity' is 2650 M$_{\odot}$, but this value remains highly uncertain.

### HALO: Hardware-aware quantization with low critical-path-delay weights   for LLM acceleration
**Authors**: Rohan Juneja, Shivam Aggarwal, Safeen Huda, Tulika Mitra, Li-Shiuan Peh

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:54:59Z

**Summary**: Quantization is critical for efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs). Yet conventional methods remain hardware-agnostic, limited to bit-width constraints, and do not account for intrinsic circuit characteristics such as the timing behaviors and energy profiles of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units. This disconnect from circuit-level behavior limits the ability to exploit available timing margins and energy-saving opportunities, reducing the overall efficiency of deployment on modern accelerators.   To address these limitations, we propose HALO, a versatile framework for Hardware-Aware Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). Unlike traditional methods, HALO explicitly incorporates detailed hardware characteristics, including critical-path timing and power consumption, into its quantization approach. HALO strategically selects weights with low critical-path-delays enabling higher operational frequencies and dynamic frequency scaling without disrupting the architecture's dataflow. Remarkably, HALO achieves these improvements with only a few dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) adjustments, ensuring simplicity and practicality in deployment. Additionally, by reducing switching activity within the MAC units, HALO effectively lowers energy consumption. Evaluations on accelerators such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) demonstrate that HALO significantly enhances inference efficiency, achieving average performance improvements of 270% and energy savings of 51% over baseline quantization methods, all with minimal impact on accuracy.

### Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection
**Authors**: Le Wang, Zonghao Ying, Tianyuan Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Shengshan Hu, Mingchuan Zhang, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:46:35Z

**Summary**: The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.

**Authors**: Nguyen Vu Khai Tam, Cao Huyen My, Vo Nguyen Le Duy

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:43:01Z

**Summary**: Transfer learning (TL) for high-dimensional regression (HDR) is an important problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited sample size in the target task. However, there currently lacks a method to quantify the statistical significance of the relationship between features and the response in TL-HDR settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical inference framework for assessing the reliability of feature selection in TL-HDR, called PTL-SI (Post-TL Statistical Inference). The core contribution of PTL-SI is its ability to provide valid $p$-values to features selected in TL-HDR, thereby rigorously controlling the false positive rate (FPR) at desired significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Furthermore, we enhance statistical power by incorporating a strategic divide-and-conquer approach into our framework. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed PTL-SI through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional datasets, confirming its theoretical properties and utility in testing the reliability of feature selection in TL scenarios.

### Estimation of the second-order coherence function using quantum   reservoir and ensemble methods
**Authors**: Dogyun Ko, Stanisław Świerczewski, Andrzej Opala, Michał Matuszewski, Amir Rahmani

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:35:08Z

**Summary**: We propose a machine learning-based approach enhanced by quantum reservoir computing (QRC) to estimate the zero-time second-order correlation function g2(0). Typically, measuring g2(0) requires single-photon detectors and time-correlated measurements. Machine learning may offer practical solutions by training a model to estimate g2(0) solely from average intensity measurements. In our method, emission from a given quantum source is first processed in QRC. During the inference phase, only intensity measurements are used, which are then passed to a software-based decision tree-based ensemble model. We evaluate this hybrid quantum-classical approach across a variety of quantum optical systems and demonstrate that it provides accurate estimates of g2(0). We further extend our analysis to assess the ability of a trained model to generalize beyond its training distribution, both to the same system under different physical parameters and to fundamentally different quantum sources. While the model may yield reliable estimates within specific regimes, its performance across distinct systems is generally limited.

**Authors**: Yilin Zhai, Hongyuan Shi, Chao Zhan, Qing Wang, Zaijin You, Nan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:51:09Z

**Summary**: Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal resilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine learning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a large language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized for wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to historical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the Northwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1) 14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to PatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units; (2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3) sustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4) demonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12) against specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling paradigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both computationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex geophysical systems modeling.

**Authors**: Rui Meng, Xiqi Cheng, Song Gao, Xiaodong Xu, Chen Dong, Guoshun Nan, Xiaofeng Tao, Ping Zhang, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:46:38Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA), which focuses on achieving endogenous security and intelligent identity authentication, has attracted considerable interest. When compared with Discriminative AI (DAI), Generative AI (GAI) offers several advantages, such as fingerprint data augmentation, fingerprint denoising and reconstruction, and protection against adversarial attacks. Inspired by these innovations, this paper provides a systematic exploration of GAI's integration into PLA frameworks. We commence with a review of representative authentication techniques, emphasizing PLA's inherent strengths. Following this, we revisit four typical GAI models and contrast the limitations of DAI with the potential of GAI in addressing PLA challenges, including insufficient fingerprint data, environment noises and inferences, perturbations in fingerprint data, and complex tasks. Specifically, we delve into providing GAI-enhance methods for PLA across the data, model, and application layers in detail. Moreover, we present a case study that combines fingerprint extrapolation, generative diffusion models, and cooperative nodes to illustrate the superiority of GAI in bolstering the reliability of PLA compared to DAI. Additionally, we outline potential future research directions for GAI-based PLA.

### BackSlash: Rate Constrained Optimized Training of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jun Wu, Jiangtao Wen, Yuxing Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:26:21Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:15:51Z

**Summary**: Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.

### EcoServe: Enabling Cost-effective LLM Serving with Proactive Intra- and   Inter-Instance Orchestration
**Authors**: Jiangsu Du, Hongbin Zhang, Taosheng Wei, Zhenyi Zheng, Kaiyi Wu, Zhiguang Chen, Yutong Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:06:22Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM serving strategies can be categorized based on whether prefill and decode phases are disaggregated: non-disaggregated (NoDG) or fully disaggregated (FuDG). However, the NoDG strategy leads to strong prefill-decode interference and the FuDG strategy highly relies on high-performance interconnects, making them less cost-effective.   We introduce EcoServe, a system that enables cost-effective LLM serving on clusters with commodity interconnects. EcoServe is built on the partially disaggregated (PaDG) strategy, applying temporal disaggregation and rolling activation for proactive intra- and inter-instance scheduling. It first disaggregates the prefill and decode phases along the time dimension within a single instance to mitigate inter-phase interference and enhance throughput. Next, it coordinates multiple instances and cyclically activates them to ensure the continuous availability of prefill processing, thereby improving latency. Thus, EcoServe's basic serving unit is the macro instance, within which multiple instances collaborate. It further integrates an adaptive scheduling algorithm to route requests in a macro instance and a mitosis scaling approach to enable fine-grained capacity scaling. Beyond delivering high goodput, EcoServe excels in load balancing, hardware cost, parallelism compatibility, and even engineering simplicity compared to existing solutions.   When serving 30B- and 70B-scale models on a production-level cluster with 32 NVIDIA L20 GPUs using commodity Ethernet, EcoServe averagely improves goodput by 82.49%, 86.17%, 122.76%, and 126.96% over four representative NoDG and FuDG systems.

### NoEsis: Differentially Private Knowledge Transfer in Modular LLM   Adaptation
**Authors**: Rob Romijnders, Stefanos Laskaridis, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Hamed Haddadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:56:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLM) are typically trained on vast amounts of data from various sources. Even when designed modularly (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts), LLMs can leak privacy on their sources. Conversely, training such models in isolation arguably prohibits generalization. To this end, we propose a framework, NoEsis, which builds upon the desired properties of modularity, privacy, and knowledge transfer. NoEsis integrates differential privacy with a hybrid two-staged parameter-efficient fine-tuning that combines domain-specific low-rank adapters, acting as experts, with common prompt tokens, acting as a knowledge-sharing backbone. Results from our evaluation on CodeXGLUE showcase that NoEsis can achieve provable privacy guarantees with tangible knowledge transfer across domains, and empirically show protection against Membership Inference Attacks. Finally, on code completion tasks, NoEsis bridges at least 77% of the accuracy gap between the non-shared and the non-private baseline.

### Neuroplasticity in Artificial Intelligence -- An Overview and   Inspirations on Drop In & Out Learning
**Authors**: Yupei Li, Manuel Milling, Björn W. Schuller

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:54:59Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved new levels of performance and spread in public usage with the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs). Initially inspired by human neurons and their connections, NNs have become the foundation of AI models for many advanced architectures. However, some of the most integral processes in the human brain, particularly neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in addition to the more spread neuroapoptosis have largely been ignored in DNN architecture design. Instead, contemporary AI development predominantly focuses on constructing advanced frameworks, such as large language models, which retain a static structure of neural connections during training and inference. In this light, we explore how neurogenesis, neuroapoptosis, and neuroplasticity can inspire future AI advances. Specifically, we examine analogous activities in artificial NNs, introducing the concepts of ``dropin'' for neurogenesis and revisiting ``dropout'' and structural pruning for neuroapoptosis. We additionally suggest neuroplasticity combining the two for future large NNs in ``life-long learning'' settings following the biological inspiration. We conclude by advocating for greater research efforts in this interdisciplinary domain and identifying promising directions for future exploration.

**Authors**: Wujie Fu, Xiaodong Shi, Lei Shi, Sakthi Sanjeev Mohanraj, Yuan Gao, Luo Qi, Pragati Aashna, Zexian Wang, Guanyu Chen, Di Zhu, Aaron Danner

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:54:21Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming modern life, yet the growing scale of AI applications places mounting demands on computational resources, raising sustainability concerns. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a promising alternative, enabling massive parallelism, low latency, and reduced electrical overhead, particularly excelling in high-throughput linear operations. However, passive and fully optical nonlinear activation functions with equally superb performance remain rare, posing a critical bottleneck in realizing all-optical neural networks on PICs. Here, we demonstrate a compact and readily integrated all-optical nonlinear activation function, experimentally realized through highly pump-depleted second-harmonic generation (SHG) in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nanophotonic waveguides, achieving 79% absolute conversion efficiency. This activation exhibits a sigmoid-like, wavelength-selective response with femtosecond-scale dynamics and light-speed processing, requiring no electrical control or auxiliary optical signals. We further validate its feasibility for neural inference by combining the measured SHG-based nonlinearity with linear operations implemented via a Mach-Zehnder interferometer system on a silicon PIC. Our demonstration achieves performance on par with digital implementations in real-world tasks, including airfoil regression and medical image classification. These results pave the way toward scalable, high-speed, and fully integrated all-optical neural networks for next-generation photonic AI hardware.

### Pre-DPO: Improving Data Utilization in Direct Preference Optimization   Using a Guiding Reference Model
**Authors**: Junshu Pan, Wei Shen, Shulin Huang, Qiji Zhou, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:47:16Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.

### Revisiting Locally Differentially Private Protocols: Towards Better   Trade-offs in Privacy, Utility, and Attack Resistance
**Authors**: Héber H. Arcolezi, Sébastien Gambs

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:40:09Z

**Summary**: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) offers strong privacy protection, especially in settings in which the server collecting the data is untrusted. However, designing LDP mechanisms that achieve an optimal trade-off between privacy, utility and robustness to adversarial inference attacks remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a general multi-objective optimization framework for refining LDP protocols, enabling the joint optimization of privacy and utility under various adversarial settings. While our framework is flexible to accommodate multiple privacy and security attacks as well as utility metrics, in this paper, we specifically optimize for Attacker Success Rate (ASR) under \emph{data reconstruction attack} as a concrete measure of privacy leakage and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a measure of utility. More precisely, we systematically revisit these trade-offs by analyzing eight state-of-the-art LDP protocols and proposing refined counterparts that leverage tailored optimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed adaptive mechanisms consistently outperform their non-adaptive counterparts, achieving substantial reductions in ASR while preserving utility, and pushing closer to the ASR-MSE Pareto frontier. By bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world vulnerabilities, our framework enables modular and context-aware deployment of LDP mechanisms with tunable privacy-utility trade-offs.

### SoK: Timeline based event reconstruction for digital forensics:   Terminology, methodology, and current challenges
**Authors**: Frank Breitinger, Hudan Studiawan, Chris Hargreaves

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:33:35Z

**Summary**: Event reconstruction is a technique that examiners can use to attempt to infer past activities by analyzing digital artifacts. Despite its significance, the field suffers from fragmented research, with studies often focusing narrowly on aspects like timeline creation or tampering detection. This paper addresses the lack of a unified perspective by proposing a comprehensive framework for timeline-based event reconstruction, adapted from traditional forensic science models. We begin by harmonizing existing terminology and presenting a cohesive diagram that clarifies the relationships between key elements of the reconstruction process. Through a comprehensive literature survey, we classify and organize the main challenges, extending the discussion beyond common issues like data volume. Lastly, we highlight recent advancements and propose directions for future research, including specific research gaps. By providing a structured approach, key findings, and a clearer understanding of the underlying challenges, this work aims to strengthen the foundation of digital forensics.

### Dual-Branch HNSW Approach with Skip Bridges and LID-Driven Optimization
**Authors**: Hy Nguyen, Nguyen Hung Nguyen, Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:22:17Z

**Summary**: The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is widely used for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, leveraging the principles of navigable small-world graphs. However, it faces some limitations. The first is the local optima problem, which arises from the algorithm's greedy search strategy, selecting neighbors based solely on proximity at each step. This often leads to cluster disconnections. The second limitation is that HNSW frequently fails to achieve logarithmic complexity, particularly in high-dimensional datasets, due to the exhaustive traversal through each layer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that mitigates local optima and cluster disconnections while enhancing the construction speed, maintaining inference speed. The first component is a dual-branch HNSW structure with LID-based insertion mechanisms, enabling traversal from multiple directions. This improves outlier node capture, enhances cluster connectivity, accelerates construction speed and reduces the risk of local minima. The second component incorporates a bridge-building technique that bypasses redundant intermediate layers, maintaining inference and making up the additional computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch structure. Experiments on various benchmarks and datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms the original HNSW in both accuracy and speed. We evaluated six datasets across Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing recall improvements of 18\% in NLP, and up to 30\% in CV tasks while reducing the construction time by up to 20\% and maintaining the inference speed. We did not observe any trade-offs in our algorithm. Ablation studies revealed that LID-based insertion had the greatest impact on performance, followed by the dual-branch structure and bridge-building components.

### Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime   Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies
**Authors**: Chen Xu, Tony Khuong Nguyen, Emma Dixon, Christopher Rodriguez, Patrick Miller, Robert Lee, Paarth Shah, Rares Ambrus, Haruki Nishimura, Masha Itkina

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:12:28Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.

### Think, Prune, Train, Improve: Scaling Reasoning without Scaling Models
**Authors**: Caia Costello, Simon Guo, Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:48:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in programming and mathematical reasoning tasks, but are constrained by limited high-quality training data. Synthetic data can be leveraged to enhance fine-tuning outcomes, but several factors influence this process, including model size, synthetic data volume, pruning strategy, and number of fine-tuning rounds. We explore these axes and investigate which conditions enable model self-improvement. We introduce the Think, Prune, Train process, a scalable framework that iteratively fine-tunes models on their own reasoning traces, using ground-truth pruning to ensure high-quality training data. This approach yields improved performance: on GSM8K, Gemma2-2B achieves a Pass@1 of 57.6% (from 41.9%), Gemma2-9B reaches 82%, matching LLaMA-3.1-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B attains 91%, even surpassing GPT-4o, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-generated reasoning and systematic data selection for improving LLM capabilities.

### Evaluating Evaluation Metrics -- The Mirage of Hallucination Detection
**Authors**: Atharva Kulkarni, Yuan Zhang, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Xiou Ge, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Dhivya Piraviperumal, Swabha Swayamdipta, Hong Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:37:29Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

### A Case Study Exploring the Current Landscape of Synthetic Medical Record   Generation with Commercial LLMs
**Authors**: Yihan Lin, Zhirong Bella Yu, Simon Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:34:43Z

**Summary**: Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer a valuable opportunity to create privacy preserving and harmonized structured data, supporting numerous applications in healthcare. Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations, and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individuals privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize across different hospitals, a long standing issue in the field. In this work, we evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize across diverse hospital settings.

### Study on Real-Time Road Surface Reconstruction Using Stereo Vision
**Authors**: Deepak Ghimire, Byoungjun Kim, Donghoon Kim, SungHwan Jeong

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:30:50Z

**Summary**: Road surface reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, providing essential information for safe and smooth navigation. This paper enhances the RoadBEV [1] framework for real-time inference on edge devices by optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. To achieve this, we proposed to apply Isomorphic Global Structured Pruning to the stereo feature extraction backbone, reducing network complexity while maintaining performance. Additionally, the head network is redesigned with an optimized hourglass structure, dynamic attention heads, reduced feature channels, mixed precision inference, and efficient probability volume computation. Our approach improves inference speed while achieving lower reconstruction error, making it well-suited for real-time road surface reconstruction in autonomous driving.

### Debiased Continuous Updating GMM with Many Weak Instruments
**Authors**: Di Zhang, Baoluo Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:26:00Z

**Summary**: Many weak instrumental variables (IVs) are routinely used in the health and social sciences to improve identification and inference, but can lead to bias in the usual two-step generalized method of moments methods. We propose a new debiased continuous updating estimator (CUE) which simultaneously address the biases from the diverging number of weak IVs, and concomitant first-step nonparametric or high-dimensional estimation of regression functions in the measured covariates. We establish mean-square rate requirements on the first-step estimators so that debiased CUE remains consistent and asymptotically normal under a many weak IVs asymptotic regime, in which the number of IVs diverges with sample size while identification shrinks. We evaluate the proposed method via extensive Monte Carlo studies and an empirical application to estimate the returns to education.

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel two-stage active learning (AL) pipeline for automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining unsupervised and supervised AL methods. The first stage utilizes unsupervised AL by using x-vectors clustering for diverse sample selection from unlabeled speech data, thus establishing a robust initial dataset for the subsequent supervised AL. The second stage incorporates a supervised AL strategy, with a batch AL method specifically developed for ASR, aimed at selecting diverse and informative batches of samples. Here, sample diversity is also achieved using x-vectors clustering, while the most informative samples are identified using a Bayesian AL method tailored for ASR with an adaptation of Monte Carlo dropout to approximate Bayesian inference. This approach enables precise uncertainty estimation, thereby enhancing ASR model training with significantly reduced data requirements. Our method has shown superior performance compared to competing methods on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and OOD test sets, demonstrating that strategic sample selection and innovative Bayesian modeling can substantially optimize both labeling effort and data utilization in deep learning-based ASR applications.

### Comparative Study on the Discourse Meaning of Chinese and English Media   in the Paris Olympics Based on LDA Topic Modeling Technology and LLM Prompt   Engineering
**Authors**: Yinglong Yu, Zhaopu Yao, Fang Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:23:55Z

**Summary**: This study analyzes Chinese and English media reports on the Paris Olympics using topic modeling, Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering, and corpus phraseology methods to explore similarities and differences in discourse construction and attitudinal meanings. Common topics include the opening ceremony, athlete performance, and sponsorship brands. Chinese media focus on specific sports, sports spirit, doping controversies, and new technologies, while English media focus on female athletes, medal wins, and eligibility controversies. Chinese reports show more frequent prepositional co-occurrences and positive semantic prosody in describing the opening ceremony and sports spirit. English reports exhibit positive semantic prosody when covering female athletes but negative prosody in predicting opening ceremony reactions and discussing women's boxing controversies.

### The Evolution of Heavy Ion Abundances with Solar Activity
**Authors**: B. L. Alterman, Y. J. Rivera, S. T. Lepri, J. M. Raines, R. D'Amicis

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:39:20Z

**Summary**: When observed at 1 AU, slow solar wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions with magnetic topologies that are intermittently open to the heliosphere. Fast wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere eg coronal holes. The evolution of the solar wind helium abundance (AHe) with solar activity is likely driven by the evolution of different solar wind source regions. Separating the solar wind into fast and slow for each element based on its characteristic speed derived in Alterman et al. (2025) we quantify the evolution of helium and heavy element abundances $(X/H):(X/H)_\mathrm{photo}$ with solar activity. We show that AHe strongly correlates with sunspot number; in slow and fast wind the average non-transient solar wind AHe is limited to 51% of its photospheric value; slow wind heavy element abundances evolve significantly with solar activity; fast wind heavy element abundances do not; the correlation coefficient with sunspot number of elemental abundances for species heavier than He monotonically increases with increasing mass; and the correlation coefficients between the in situ observations and the normalized sunspot number are stronger than those using the unnormalized sunspot number. We infer that the sunspot number is a clock timing the solar cycle but not the driver of the physical process underlying the evolution of these abundances with solar activity; this underlying process is likely related to the energy available to accelerate the solar plasma from the chromosphere and transition region or low corona into the solar wind; and differences between the evolution of slow and fast solar wind abundances are similarly related to the energy available to accelerate the elements at these heights above the Suns surface.

### Leveraging Label Semantics and Meta-Label Refinement for Multi-Label   Question Classification
**Authors**: Shi Dong, Xiaobei Niu, Rui Zhong, Zhifeng Wang, Mingzhang Zuo

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:36:19Z

**Summary**: Accurate annotation of educational resources is crucial for effective personalized learning and resource recommendation in online education. However, fine-grained knowledge labels often overlap or share similarities, making it difficult for existing multi-label classification methods to differentiate them. The label distribution imbalance due to sparsity of human annotations further intensifies these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces RR2QC, a novel Retrieval Reranking method to multi-label Question Classification by leveraging label semantics and meta-label refinement. First, RR2QC improves the pre-training strategy by utilizing semantic relationships within and across label groups. Second, it introduces a class center learning task to align questions with label semantics during downstream training. Finally, this method decomposes labels into meta-labels and uses a meta-label classifier to rerank the retrieved label sequences. In doing so, RR2QC enhances the understanding and prediction capability of long-tail labels by learning from meta-labels that frequently appear in other labels. Additionally, a mathematical LLM is used to generate solutions for questions, extracting latent information to further refine the model's insights. Experimental results show that RR2QC outperforms existing methods in Precision@K and F1 scores across multiple educational datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for online education applications. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/78Erii/RR2QC.

### Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment
**Authors**: Leitian Tao, Yixuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:34:47Z

**Summary**: The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback.

### Random-Set Large Language Models
**Authors**: Muhammad Mubashar, Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Fabio Cuzzolin

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:25:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b, Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the capability to detect when its hallucinating.

**Authors**: Yuqiao Yang, Yongzhao Zhang, Wenhao Liu, Jun Li, Pengtao Shi, DingYu Zhong, Jie Yang, Ting Chen, Sheng Cao, Yuntao Ren, Yongyue Wu, Xiaosong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:19:02Z

**Summary**: As modern vehicles evolve into intelligent and connected systems, their growing complexity introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) has therefore become essential for managing these risks under mandatory regulations. However, existing TARA automation methods rely on static threat libraries, limiting their utility in the detailed, function-level analyses demanded by industry. This paper introduces DefenseWeaver, the first system that automates function-level TARA using component-specific details and large language models (LLMs). DefenseWeaver dynamically generates attack trees and risk evaluations from system configurations described in an extended OpenXSAM++ format, then employs a multi-agent framework to coordinate specialized LLM roles for more robust analysis. To further adapt to evolving threats and diverse standards, DefenseWeaver incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with expert-curated TARA reports. We validated DefenseWeaver through deployment in four automotive security projects, where it identified 11 critical attack paths, verified through penetration testing, and subsequently reported and remediated by the relevant automakers and suppliers. Additionally, DefenseWeaver demonstrated cross-domain adaptability, successfully applying to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and marine navigation systems. In comparison to human experts, DefenseWeaver outperformed manual attack tree generation across six assessment scenarios. Integrated into commercial cybersecurity platforms such as UAES and Xiaomi, DefenseWeaver has generated over 8,200 attack trees. These results highlight its ability to significantly reduce processing time, and its scalability and transformative impact on cybersecurity across industries.

### Stabilizing Reasoning in Medical LLMs with Continued Pretraining and   Reasoning Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Wataru Kawakami, Keita Suzuki, Junichiro Iwasawa

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:15:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first, Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:14:14Z

**Summary**: Recent Computer-Using Agents (CUAs), powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), offer a promising direction for automating complex desktop workflows through natural language. However, most existing CUAs remain conceptual prototypes, hindered by shallow OS integration, fragile screenshot-based interaction, and disruptive execution.   We present UFO2, a multiagent AgentOS for Windows desktops that elevates CUAs into practical, system-level automation. UFO2 features a centralized HostAgent for task decomposition and coordination, alongside a collection of application-specialized AppAgent equipped with native APIs, domain-specific knowledge, and a unified GUI--API action layer. This architecture enables robust task execution while preserving modularity and extensibility. A hybrid control detection pipeline fuses Windows UI Automation (UIA) with vision-based parsing to support diverse interface styles. Runtime efficiency is further enhanced through speculative multi-action planning, reducing per-step LLM overhead. Finally, a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) interface enables automation within an isolated virtual desktop, allowing agents and users to operate concurrently without interference.   We evaluate UFO2 across over 20 real-world Windows applications, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and execution accuracy over prior CUAs. Our results show that deep OS integration unlocks a scalable path toward reliable, user-aligned desktop automation.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:08:45Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). That is, C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup. This is so, due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build concurrent communication collectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### Modular integration of neural connectomics, dynamics and biomechanics   for identification of behavioral sensorimotor pathways in Caenorhabditis   elegans
**Authors**: Jimin Kim, Jeremy T. Florman, Julia A. Santos, Mark J. Alkema, Eli Shlizerman

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:04:03Z

**Summary**: Computational approaches which emulate in-vivo nervous system are needed to investigate mechanisms of the brain to orchestrate behavior. Such approaches must integrate a series of biophysical models encompassing the nervous system, muscles, biomechanics to allow observing the system in its entirety while supporting model variations. Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling framework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a model as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each describing specific biophysical processes across different modalities. Utilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans built upon the complete connectome. The model integrates a series of 7 modules: i) intra-cellular dynamics, ii) electrical and iii) chemical extra-cellular neural dynamics, iv) translation of neural activity to muscle calcium dynamics, v) muscle calcium dynamics to muscle forces, vi) muscle forces to body postures and vii) proprioceptive feedback. We validate the base model by in-silico injection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with locomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications of in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show that the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward and backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance and turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer novel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors. To further dissect mechanisms of locomotion, we utilize modWorm to introduce empirical based model variations and model optimizations to elucidate their effects on simulated locomotion. Our results show that modWorm can be utilized to identify neural circuits which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.

### Quadratic Interest Network for Multimodal Click-Through Rate Prediction
**Authors**: Honghao Li, Hanwei Li, Jing Zhang, Yi Zhang, Ziniu Yu, Lei Sang, Yiwen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:02:28Z

**Summary**: Multimodal click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a key technique in industrial recommender systems. It leverages heterogeneous modalities such as text, images, and behavioral logs to capture high-order feature interactions between users and items, thereby enhancing the system's understanding of user interests and its ability to predict click behavior. The primary challenge in this field lies in effectively utilizing the rich semantic information from multiple modalities while satisfying the low-latency requirements of online inference in real-world applications. To foster progress in this area, the Multimodal CTR Prediction Challenge Track of the WWW 2025 EReL@MIR Workshop formulates the problem into two tasks: (1) Task 1 of Multimodal Item Embedding: this task aims to explore multimodal information extraction and item representation learning methods that enhance recommendation tasks; and (2) Task 2 of Multimodal CTR Prediction: this task aims to explore what multimodal recommendation model can effectively leverage multimodal embedding features and achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model for Task 2, named Quadratic Interest Network (QIN) for Multimodal CTR Prediction. Specifically, QIN employs adaptive sparse target attention to extract multimodal user behavior features, and leverages Quadratic Neural Networks to capture high-order feature interactions. As a result, QIN achieved an AUC of 0.9798 on the leaderboard and ranked second in the competition. The model code, training logs, hyperparameter configurations, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/salmon1802/QIN.

### PropRAG: Guiding Retrieval with Beam Search over Proposition Paths
**Authors**: Jingjin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:47:34Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard non-parametric approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting common in continual learning. However, standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the interconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning (associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured RAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples, the inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework leveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm over proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains. Crucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without invoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and pre-computed embeddings. This avoids online LLM inference costs and potential inconsistencies during evidence gathering. LLMs are used effectively offline for high-quality proposition extraction and post-retrieval for answer generation. PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 results on PopQA (55.3%), 2Wiki (93.7%), HotpotQA (97.0%), and MuSiQue (77.3%), alongside top F1 scores (e.g., 52.4% on MuSiQue). By improving evidence retrieval through richer representation and explicit, LLM-free online path finding, PropRAG advances non-parametric continual learning.

### S3MOT: Monocular 3D Object Tracking with Selective State Space Model
**Authors**: Zhuohao Yan, Shaoquan Feng, Xingxing Li, Yuxuan Zhou, Chunxi Xia, Shengyu Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:45:35Z

**Summary**: Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential for advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/bytepioneerX/s3mot.

### M4U: Evaluating Multilingual Understanding and Reasoning for Large   Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Jiayu Xu, Senwei Xie, Ruiping Wang, Jialin Li, Zhaojie Xie, Bin Zhang, Chuyan Xiong, Xilin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:37:45Z

**Summary**: Multilingual capability is an essential aspect for large multimodal models, since they are usually deployed across various countries and languages. However, most existing benchmarks for multilingual multimodal reasoning struggle to differentiate between models of varying performance; even language models without visual capabilities can easily achieve high scores. This leaves a comprehensive evaluation of leading multilingual multimodal models largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce M4U, a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing the capability of multi-discipline multilingual multimodal understanding and reasoning. M4U contains 10k samples covering 64 disciplines across 16 subfields in Science, Engineering, and Healthcare in six languages. Using M4U, we conduct extensive evaluations of leading Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools. The evaluation results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.6% average accuracy on M4U. Additionally, we observe that the leading LMMs exhibit significant language preferences. Our in-depth analysis indicates that leading LMMs, including GPT-4o, struggle to perform reasoning using multilingual information present in both visual and textual context. Specifically, they suffer performance degradation when prompted with cross-lingual multimodal questions. Our code and dataset is public available.

### LLM-Guided Open RAN: Empowering Hierarchical RAN Intelligent Control
**Authors**: Lingyan Bao, Sinwoong Yun, Jemin Lee, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:18:23Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a significant interest in deploying LLMempowered algorithms for wireless communication networks. Meanwhile, open radio access network (O-RAN) techniques offer unprecedented flexibility, with the non-real-time (non-RT) radio access network (RAN) intelligent controller (RIC) (non-RT RIC) and near-real-time (near-RT) RIC (near-RT RIC) components enabling intelligent resource management across different time scales. In this paper, we propose the LLM empowered hierarchical RIC (LLM-hRIC) framework to improve the collaboration between RICs. This framework integrates LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient network resource management. In this framework, LLMs-empowered non-RT RICs provide strategic guidance and high-level policies based on environmental context. Concurrently, RL-empowered near-RT RICs perform low-latency tasks based on strategic guidance and local near-RT observation. We evaluate the LLM-hRIC framework in an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network setting. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Finally, we discuss the key future challenges in applying LLMs to O-RAN.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:54:24Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V. The data and code are available at https://github.com/Kizna1ver/DREAM.

### Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal Clinical Rationale Generation for Disease   Diagnosis with Small Language Models
**Authors**: Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Yida Xu, Yunya Song, Xian Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:53:34Z

**Summary**: Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack of domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable mutlimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in a same encoding space, enabling it naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### TRACE Back from the Future: A Probabilistic Reasoning Approach to   Controllable Language Generation
**Authors**: Gwen Yidou Weng, Benjie Wang, Guy Van den Broeck

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:59:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead, adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly extends to composite attributes.

### Facets, Taxonomies, and Syntheses: Navigating Structured Representations   in LLM-Assisted Literature Review
**Authors**: Raymond Fok, Joseph Chee Chang, Marissa Radensky, Pao Siangliulue, Jonathan Bragg, Amy X. Zhang, Daniel S. Weld

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T17:09:29Z

**Summary**: Comprehensive literature review requires synthesizing vast amounts of research -- a labor intensive and cognitively demanding process. Most prior work focuses either on helping researchers deeply understand a few papers (e.g., for triaging or reading), or retrieving from and visualizing a vast corpus. Deep analysis and synthesis of large paper collections (e.g., to produce a survey paper) is largely conducted manually with little support. We present DimInd, an interactive system that scaffolds literature review across large paper collections through LLM-generated structured representations. DimInd scaffolds literature understanding with multiple levels of compression, from papers, to faceted literature comparison tables with information extracted from individual papers, to taxonomies of concepts, to narrative syntheses. Users are guided through these successive information transformations while maintaining provenance to source text. In an evaluation with 23 researchers, DimInd supported participants in extracting information and conceptually organizing papers with less effort compared to a ChatGPT-assisted baseline workflow.

### Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse
**Authors**: George Drayson, Emine Yilmaz, Vasileios Lampos

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:53:47Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present. We release our code at https://github.com/GeorgeDrayson/model_collapse.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:47:44Z

**Summary**: The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

### A Picture is Worth A Thousand Numbers: Enabling LLMs Reason about Time   Series via Visualization
**Authors**: Haoxin Liu, Chenghao Liu, B. Aditya Prakash

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:39:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), with demonstrated reasoning abilities across multiple domains, are largely underexplored for time-series reasoning (TsR), which is ubiquitous in the real world. In this work, we propose TimerBed, the first comprehensive testbed for evaluating LLMs' TsR performance. Specifically, TimerBed includes stratified reasoning patterns with real-world tasks, comprehensive combinations of LLMs and reasoning strategies, and various supervised models as comparison anchors. We perform extensive experiments with TimerBed, test multiple current beliefs, and verify the initial failures of LLMs in TsR, evidenced by the ineffectiveness of zero shot (ZST) and performance degradation of few shot in-context learning (ICL). Further, we identify one possible root cause: the numerical modeling of data. To address this, we propose a prompt-based solution VL-Time, using visualization-modeled data and language-guided reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Vl-Time enables multimodal LLMs to be non-trivial ZST and powerful ICL reasoners for time series, achieving about 140% average performance improvement and 99% average token costs reduction.

### FoC: Figure out the Cryptographic Functions in Stripped Binaries with   LLMs
**Authors**: Xiuwei Shang, Guoqiang Chen, Shaoyin Cheng, Shikai Guo, Yanming Zhang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:39:40Z

**Summary**: Analyzing the behavior of cryptographic functions in stripped binaries is a challenging but essential task. Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection. Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries. In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoC-BinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language. The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches. To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database. In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain. And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions. Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score. FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.

### DCFormer: Efficient 3D Vision-Language Modeling with Decomposed   Convolutions
**Authors**: Gorkem Can Ates, Yu Xin, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:36:21Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely applied to 2D medical image analysis due to their ability to align visual and textual representations. However, extending VLMs to 3D imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs often rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, or on 3D convolutions, which require large numbers of parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along the depth, height, and width dimensions. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is trained and evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports. In zero-shot and fine-tuned detection of 18 pathologies, as well as in image-text retrieval tasks, DCFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D vision encoders, including CT-ViT, ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/DCFormer.

### Generative Induction of Dialogue Task Schemas with Streaming Refinement   and Simulated Interactions
**Authors**: James D. Finch, Yasasvi Josyula, Jinho D. Choi

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:29:45Z

**Summary**: In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, Slot Schema Induction (SSI) is essential for automatically identifying key information slots from dialogue data without manual intervention. This paper presents a novel state-of-the-art (SoTA) approach that formulates SSI as a text generation task, where a language model incrementally constructs and refines a slot schema over a stream of dialogue data. To develop this approach, we present a fully automatic LLM-based TOD simulation method that creates data with high-quality state labels for novel task domains. Furthermore, we identify issues in SSI evaluation due to data leakage and poor metric alignment with human judgment. We resolve these by creating new evaluation data using our simulation method with human guidance and correction, as well as designing improved evaluation metrics. These contributions establish a foundation for future SSI research and advance the SoTA in dialogue understanding and system development.

### ElChat: Adapting Chat Language Models Using Only Target Unlabeled   Language Data
**Authors**: Atsuki Yamaguchi, Terufumi Morishita, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:08:57Z

**Summary**: Vocabulary expansion (VE) is the de-facto approach to language adaptation of large language models (LLMs) by adding new tokens and continuing pre-training on target data. While this is effective for base models trained on unlabeled data, it poses challenges for chat models trained to follow instructions through labeled conversation data. Directly adapting the latter with VE on target unlabeled data may result in forgetting chat abilities. While ideal, target chat data is often unavailable or costly to create for low-resource languages, and machine-translated alternatives are not always effective. To address this issue, previous work proposed using a base and chat model from the same family. This method first adapts the base LLM with VE on target unlabeled data and then converts it to a chat model by adding a chat vector (CV) derived from the weight difference between the source base and chat models. We propose ElChat, a new language adaptation method for chat LLMs that adapts a chat model directly on target unlabeled data, without a base model. It elicits chat abilities by injecting information from the source chat model. ElChat offers more robust and competitive target language and safety performance while achieving superior English, chat, and instruction-following abilities compared to CV.

### Enhancing Strawberry Yield Forecasting with Backcasted IoT Sensor Data   and Machine Learning
**Authors**: Tewodros Alemu Ayall, Andy Li, Matthew Beddows, Milan Markovic, Georgios Leontidis

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T16:02:50Z

**Summary**: Due to rapid population growth globally, digitally-enabled agricultural sectors are crucial for sustainable food production and making informed decisions about resource management for farmers and various stakeholders. The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that collect real-time observations of various environmental (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and operational factors (e.g., irrigation) influencing production is often seen as a critical step to enable additional novel downstream tasks, such as AI-based yield forecasting. However, since AI models require large amounts of data, this creates practical challenges in a real-world dynamic farm setting where IoT observations would need to be collected over a number of seasons. In this study, we deployed IoT sensors in strawberry production polytunnels for two growing seasons to collect environmental data, including water usage, external and internal temperature, external and internal humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation. The sensor observations were combined with manually provided yield records spanning a period of four seasons. To bridge the gap of missing IoT observations for two additional seasons, we propose an AI-based backcasting approach to generate synthetic sensor observations using historical weather data from a nearby weather station and the existing polytunnel observations. We built an AI-based yield forecasting model to evaluate our approach using the combination of real and synthetic observations. Our results demonstrated that incorporating synthetic data improved yield forecasting accuracy, with models incorporating synthetic data outperforming those trained only on historical yield, weather records, and real sensor data.

### Efficient Budget Allocation for Large-Scale LLM-Enabled Virtual   Screening
**Authors**: Zaile Li, Weiwei Fan, L. Jeff Hong

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:59:19Z

**Summary**: Screening tasks that aim to identify a small subset of top alternatives from a large pool are common in business decision-making processes. These tasks often require substantial human effort to evaluate each alternative's performance, making them time-consuming and costly. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their ability to generate outputs that align well with human evaluations, we consider an LLM-as-human-evaluator approach for conducting screening virtually, thereby reducing the cost burden. To achieve scalability and cost-effectiveness in virtual screening, we identify that the stochastic nature of LLM outputs and their cost structure necessitate efficient budget allocation across all alternatives. To address this, we propose using a top-$m$ greedy evaluation mechanism, a simple yet effective approach that keeps evaluating the current top-$m$ alternatives, and design the explore-first top-$m$ greedy (EFG-$m$) algorithm. We prove that EFG-$m$ is both sample-optimal and consistent in large-scale virtual screening. Surprisingly, we also uncover a bonus ranking effect, where the algorithm naturally induces an indifference-based ranking within the selected subset. To further enhance practicality, we design a suite of algorithm variants to improve screening performance and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments validate our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. Lastly, we conduct a case study on LLM-based virtual screening. The study shows that while LLMs alone may not provide meaningful screening and ranking results when directly queried, integrating them with our sample-optimal algorithms unlocks their potential for cost-effective, large-scale virtual screening.

### The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Avner Seror

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:47:33Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40 leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning, but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:39:04Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30% accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance, especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:31:46Z

**Summary**: We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that excels in audio understanding, generation, and conversation. We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio.

### LLMpatronous: Harnessing the Power of LLMs For Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Rajesh Yarra

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:30:40Z

**Summary**: Despite the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various sectors, cyber security continues to rely on traditional static and dynamic analysis tools, hampered by high false positive rates and superficial code comprehension. While generative AI offers promising automation capabilities for software development, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection presents unique challenges. This paper explores the potential and limitations of LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities, acknowledging inherent weaknesses such as hallucinations, limited context length, and knowledge cut-offs. Previous attempts employing machine learning models for vulnerability detection have proven ineffective due to limited real-world applicability, feature engineering challenges, lack of contextual understanding, and the complexities of training models to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. Therefore, we propose a robust AI-driven approach focused on mitigating these limitations and ensuring the quality and reliability of LLM based vulnerability detection. Through innovative methodologies combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Mixtureof-Agents (MoA), this research seeks to leverage the strengths of LLMs while addressing their weaknesses, ultimately paving the way for dependable and efficient AI-powered solutions in securing the ever-evolving software landscape.

### CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization
**Authors**: Tom Zehle, Moritz Schlager, Timo Heiß, Matthias Feurer

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:27:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.

### Spatial Audio Processing with Large Language Model on Wearable Devices
**Authors**: Ayushi Mishra, Yang Bai, Priyadarshan Narayanasamy, Nakul Garg, Nirupam Roy

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:21:54Z

**Summary**: Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.

### BitNet v2: Native 4-bit Activations with Hadamard Transformation for   1-bit LLMs
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:17:52Z

**Summary**: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2 achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for batched inference.

### Expressing stigma and inappropriate responses prevents LLMs from safely   replacing mental health providers
**Authors**: Jared Moore, Declan Grabb, William Agnew, Kevin Klyman, Stevie Chancellor, Desmond C. Ong, Nick Haber

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:14:21Z

**Summary**: Should a large language model (LLM) be used as a therapist? In this paper, we investigate the use of LLMs to *replace* mental health providers, a use case promoted in the tech startup and research space. We conduct a mapping review of therapy guides used by major medical institutions to identify crucial aspects of therapeutic relationships, such as the importance of a therapeutic alliance between therapist and client. We then assess the ability of LLMs to reproduce and adhere to these aspects of therapeutic relationships by conducting several experiments investigating the responses of current LLMs, such as `gpt-4o`. Contrary to best practices in the medical community, LLMs 1) express stigma toward those with mental health conditions and 2) respond inappropriately to certain common (and critical) conditions in naturalistic therapy settings -- e.g., LLMs encourage clients' delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy. This occurs even with larger and newer LLMs, indicating that current safety practices may not address these gaps. Furthermore, we note foundational and practical barriers to the adoption of LLMs as therapists, such as that a therapeutic alliance requires human characteristics (e.g., identity and stakes). For these reasons, we conclude that LLMs should not replace therapists, and we discuss alternative roles for LLMs in clinical therapy.

### Can Code Outlove Blood? A LLM-based VR Experience to Prompt Reflection   on Parental Verbal Abuse
**Authors**: Jiaying Fu, Jialin Gu, Tianyue Gong, Tiange Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:10:51Z

**Summary**: Parental verbal abuse leaves lasting emotional impacts, yet current therapeutic approaches often lack immersive self-reflection opportunities. To address this, we developed a VR experience powered by LLMs to foster reflection on parental verbal abuse. Participants with relevant experiences engage in a dual-phase VR experience: first assuming the role of a verbally abusive parent, interacting with an LLM portraying a child, then observing the LLM reframing abusive dialogue into warm, supportive expressions as a nurturing parent. A qualitative study with 12 participants showed that the experience encourages reflection on their past experiences and fosters supportive emotions. However, these effects vary with participants' personal histories, emphasizing the need for greater personalization in AI-driven emotional support. This study explores the use of LLMs in immersive environment to promote emotional reflection, offering insights into the design of AI-driven emotional support systems.

### DeepDistill: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities via Large-Scale   Difficulty-Graded Data Training
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Tian, Sitong Zhao, Haotian Wang, Shuaiting Chen, Yiping Peng, Yunjie Ji, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:10:20Z

**Summary**: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark.

**Authors**: Jingtong Gao, Yewen Li, Shuai Mao, Peng Jiang, Nan Jiang, Yejing Wang, Qingpeng Cai, Fei Pan, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai, Bo An, Xiangyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:04:43Z

**Summary**: Auto-bidding, with its strong capability to optimize bidding decisions within dynamic and competitive online environments, has become a pivotal strategy for advertising platforms. Existing approaches typically employ rule-based strategies or Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. However, rule-based strategies lack the flexibility to adapt to time-varying market conditions, and RL-based methods struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observations within Markov Decision Process (MDP) frameworks. Furthermore, these approaches often face challenges in ensuring strategy adaptability across diverse advertising objectives. Additionally, as offline training methods are increasingly adopted to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of stable online strategies, the issues of documented behavioral patterns and behavioral collapse resulting from training on fixed offline datasets become increasingly significant. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel offline Generative Auto-bidding framework with Value-Guided Explorations (GAVE). GAVE accommodates various advertising objectives through a score-based Return-To-Go (RTG) module. Moreover, GAVE integrates an action exploration mechanism with an RTG-based evaluation method to explore novel actions while ensuring stability-preserving updates. A learnable value function is also designed to guide the direction of action exploration and mitigate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problems. Experimental results on two offline datasets and real-world deployments demonstrate that GAVE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests. By applying the core methods of this framework, we proudly secured first place in the NeurIPS 2024 competition, 'AIGB Track: Learning Auto-Bidding Agents with Generative Models'.

### Trade-offs in Reliability and Performance Using Selective Beamforming   for Ultra-Massive MIMO
**Authors**: Anis Hamadouche, Mathini Sellathurai

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:52:38Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the optimization challenges in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems, focusing on array selection and beamforming in dynamic and diverse operational contexts. We introduce a novel array selection criterion that incorporates antenna health information into the optimization process, distinguishing our approach from traditional methods. Our methodology employs dual proximal-gradient ascent to effectively tackle the constrained non-convex and non-smooth nature of sparse array selection problems. A central feature of our strategy is the implementation of proportional fairness among communication users, aligning with system resource limitations while ensuring minimum rate requirements for all users. This approach not only enhances system efficiency and responsiveness but also ensures equitable resource distribution. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in optimizing Ultra-Massive MIMO system performance, demonstrating their applicability in complex communication scenarios. Our findings reveal key trade-offs influenced by the sparsity promotion weight (\(\gamma\)). As \(\gamma\) increases, spectral efficiency (SE) and communication rate (Ri) decrease, while beamforming matrix density (BMD) reduces and antenna reliability (RL) significantly improves. These results highlight the critical balance between performance and reliability, essential for the practical deployment of Ultra-Massive MIMO systems. This work advances the field by providing innovative solutions and new insights into array selection and beamforming optimization, setting a foundation for future research in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems.

### PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory   Planner
**Authors**: Kota Kondo, Claudius T. Tewari, Andrea Tagliabue, Jesus Tordesillas, Parker C. Lusk, Mason B. Peterson, Jonathan P. How

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:44:51Z

**Summary**: In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.

### Bridge the Domains: Large Language Models Enhanced Cross-domain   Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Qidong Liu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yejing Wang, Zijian Zhang, Howard Zhong, Chong Chen, Xiang Li, Wei Huang, Feng Tian

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:30:25Z

**Summary**: Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference from the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some progress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e., overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by bridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view. Therefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation model (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose an LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a trainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR task. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize user cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into the proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the effectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.

### Auto-SLURP: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Multi-Agent Frameworks in   Smart Personal Assistant
**Authors**: Lei Shen, Xiaoyu Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:17:47Z

**Summary**: In recent years, multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly. Despite this progress, there is still a notable absence of benchmark datasets specifically tailored to evaluate their performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Auto-SLURP, a benchmark dataset aimed at evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks in the context of intelligent personal assistants. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset -- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services. This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline, covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remain a work in progress. The dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/lorashen/Auto-SLURP/.

### ThreMoLIA: Threat Modeling of Large Language Model-Integrated   Applications
**Authors**: Felix Viktor Jedrzejewski, Davide Fucci, Oleksandr Adamov

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:11:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently being integrated into industrial software applications to help users perform more complex tasks in less time. However, these LLM-Integrated Applications (LIA) expand the attack surface and introduce new kinds of threats. Threat modeling is commonly used to identify these threats and suggest mitigations. However, it is a time-consuming practice that requires the involvement of a security practitioner. Our goals are to 1) provide a method for performing threat modeling for LIAs early in their lifecycle, (2) develop a threat modeling tool that integrates existing threat models, and (3) ensure high-quality threat modeling. To achieve the goals, we work in collaboration with our industry partner. Our proposed way of performing threat modeling will benefit industry by requiring fewer security experts' participation and reducing the time spent on this activity. Our proposed tool combines LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses sources such as existing threat models and application architecture repositories to continuously create and update threat models. We propose to evaluate the tool offline -- i.e., using benchmarking -- and online with practitioners in the field. We conducted an early evaluation using ChatGPT on a simple LIA and obtained results that encouraged us to proceed with our research efforts.

### Predicting sampling advantage of stochastic Ising Machines for Quantum   Simulations
**Authors**: Rutger J. L. F. Berns, Davi R. Rodrigues, Giovanni Finocchio, Johan H. Mentink

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T14:01:00Z

**Summary**: Stochastic Ising machines, sIMs, are highly promising accelerators for optimization and sampling of computational problems that can be formulated as an Ising model. Here we investigate the computational advantage of sIM for simulations of quantum magnets with neural-network quantum states (NQS), in which the quantum many-body wave function is mapped onto an Ising model. We study the sampling performance of sIM for NQS by comparing sampling on a software-emulated sIM with standard Metropolis-Hastings sampling for NQS. We quantify the sampling efficiency by the number of steps required to reach iso-accurate stochastic estimation of the variational energy and show that this is entirely determined by the autocorrelation time of the sampling. This enables predications of sampling advantage without direct deployment on hardware. For the quantum Heisenberg models studied and experimental results on the runtime of sIMs, we project a possible speed-up of 100 to 10000, suggesting great opportunities for studying complex quantum systems at larger scales.

### Revisiting Data Auditing in Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Hongyu Zhu, Sichu Liang, Wenwen Wang, Boheng Li, Tongxin Yuan, Fangqi Li, ShiLin Wang, Zhuosheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:38:23Z

**Summary**: With the surge of large language models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)--which integrate vision encoders with LLMs for accurate visual grounding--have shown great potential in tasks like generalist agents and robotic control. However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations, and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%). In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions, performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts, and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible. Our study presents a systematic view of the limits and opportunities of MI for VLMs, providing guidance for future efforts in trustworthy data auditing.

### Comparing Uncertainty Measurement and Mitigation Methods for Large   Language Models: A Systematic Review
**Authors**: Toghrul Abbasli, Kentaroh Toyoda, Yuan Wang, Leon Witt, Muhammad Asif Ali, Yukai Miao, Dan Li, Qingsong Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:34:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

### Large Language Models to Accelerate Organic Chemistry Synthesis
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Yang Han, Shuai Chen, Ruijie Yu, Xin Zhao, Xianbin Liu, Kaipeng Zeng, Mengdi Yu, Jidong Tian, Feng Zhu, Xiaokang Yang, Yaohui Jin, Yanyan Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:30:07Z

**Summary**: Chemical synthesis, as a foundational methodology in the creation of transformative molecules, exerts substantial influence across diverse sectors from life sciences to materials and energy. Current chemical synthesis practices emphasize laborious and costly trial-and-error workflows, underscoring the urgent need for advanced AI assistants. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs), typified by GPT-4, have been introduced as an efficient tool to facilitate scientific research. Here, we present Chemma, a fully fine-tuned LLM with 1.28 million pairs of Q&A about reactions, as an assistant to accelerate organic chemistry synthesis. Chemma surpasses the best-known results in multiple chemical tasks, e.g., single-step retrosynthesis and yield prediction, which highlights the potential of general AI for organic chemistry. Via predicting yields across the experimental reaction space, Chemma significantly improves the reaction exploration capability of Bayesian optimization. More importantly, integrated in an active learning framework, Chemma exhibits advanced potential for autonomous experimental exploration and optimization in open reaction spaces. For an unreported Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of cyclic aminoboronates and aryl halides for the synthesis of $\alpha$-Aryl N-heterocycles, the human-AI collaboration successfully explored suitable ligand and solvent (1,4-dioxane) within only 15 runs, achieving an isolated yield of 67%. These results reveal that, without quantum-chemical calculations, Chemma can comprehend and extract chemical insights from reaction data, in a manner akin to human experts. This work opens avenues for accelerating organic chemistry synthesis with adapted large language models.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:08:59Z

**Summary**: Molecular Communication (MC) has long been envisioned to enable an Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) with medical applications, where nanomachines within the human body conduct monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy at micro- and nanoscale levels. MC involves information transfer via molecules and is supported by well-established theoretical models. However, practically achieving reliable, energy-efficient, and bio-compatible communication at these scales still remains a challenge. Air-Based Molecular Communication (ABMC) is a type of MC that operates over larger, meter-scale distances and extends even outside the human body. Therefore, devices and techniques to realize ABMC are readily accessible, and associated use cases can be very promising in the near future. Exhaled breath analysis has previously been proposed. It provides a non-invasive approach for health monitoring, leveraging existing commercial sensor technologies and reducing deployment barriers. The breath contains a diverse range of molecules and particles that serve as biomarkers linked to various physiological and pathological conditions. The plethora of proven methods, models, and optimization approaches in MC enable macroscale breath analysis, treating human as the transmitter, the breath as the information carrier, and macroscale sensors as the receiver. Using ABMC to interface with the inherent dynamic networks of cells, tissues, and organs could create a novel Internet of Bio Things (IoBT), a preliminary macroscale stage of the IoBNT. This survey extensively reviews exhaled breath modeling and analysis through the lens of MC, offering insights into theoretical frameworks and practical implementations from ABMC, bringing the IoBT a step closer to real-world use.

### EPO: Explicit Policy Optimization for Strategic Reasoning in LLMs via   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yongbin Li, Yuchuan Wu, Wentao Ma, Aobo Kong, Fei Huang, Jianbin Jiao, Junge Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T13:03:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications. Code and data are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/EPO.

### Towards Adaptive Software Agents for Debugging
**Authors**: Yacine Majdoub, Eya Ben Charrada, Haifa Touati

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:48:08Z

**Summary**: Using multiple agents was found to improve the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models. However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.

### StoryGPT-V: Large Language Models as Consistent Story Visualizers
**Authors**: Xiaoqian Shen, Mohamed Elhoseiny

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:47:21Z

**Summary**: Recent generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating realistic and visually pleasing images grounded on textual prompts. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption. Our code is publicly available at: \href{https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/StoryGPT-V}{https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/StoryGPT-V}.

### Generative Evaluation of Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haowei Lin, Xiangyu Wang, Ruilin Yan, Baizhou Huang, Haotian Ye, Jianhua Zhu, Zihao Wang, James Zou, Jianzhu Ma, Yitao Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T12:02:19Z

**Summary**: With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

### LEAM: A Prompt-only Large Language Model-enabled Antenna Modeling Method
**Authors**: Tao Wu, Kexue Fu, Qiang Hua, Xinxin Liu, Muhammad Ali Imran, Bo Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:29:30Z

**Summary**: Antenna modeling is a time-consuming and complex process, decreasing the speed of antenna analysis and design. In this paper, a large language model (LLM)- enabled antenna modeling method, called LEAM, is presented to address this challenge. LEAM enables automatic antenna model generation based on language descriptions via prompt input, images, descriptions from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple). The effectiveness of LEAM is demonstrated by three examples: a Vivaldi antenna generated from a complete user description, a slotted patch antenna generated from an incomplete user description and the operating frequency, and a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions scanned from the literature. For all the examples, correct antenna models are generated in a few minutes. The code can be accessed via https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM.

### TextTIGER: Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity Prompt   Refinement for Text-to-Image Generation
**Authors**: Shintaro Ozaki, Kazuki Hayashi, Yusuke Sakai, Jingun Kwon, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Manabu Okumura, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:27:44Z

**Summary**: Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub (WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available upon acceptance.

**Authors**: Jieyong Kim, Hyunseo Kim, Hyunjin Cho, SeongKu Kang, Buru Chang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:10:43Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.

**Authors**: Guanqun Bi, Zhuang Chen, Zhoufu Liu, Hongkai Wang, Xiyao Xiao, Yuqiang Xie, Wen Zhang, Yongkang Huang, Yuxuan Chen, Libiao Peng, Yi Feng, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T11:08:27Z

**Summary**: Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable reasoning.

**Authors**: Daniil Gurgurov, Tanja Bäumel, Tatiana Anikina

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:53:27Z

**Summary**: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained large popularity among Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers and practitioners. These models, trained on huge datasets, show proficiency across various languages and demonstrate effectiveness in numerous downstream tasks. This paper navigates the landscape of multilingual LLMs, providing an introductory overview of their technical aspects. It explains underlying architectures, objective functions, pre-training data sources, and tokenization methods. This work explores the unique features of different model types: encoder-only (mBERT, XLM-R), decoder-only (XGLM, PALM, BLOOM, GPT-3), and encoder-decoder models (mT5, mBART). Additionally, it addresses one of the significant limitations of multilingual LLMs - the curse of multilinguality - and discusses current attempts to overcome it.

### Efficient Single-Pass Training for Multi-Turn Reasoning
**Authors**: Ritesh Goru, Shanay Mehta, Prateek Jain

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:46:56Z

**Summary**: Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on multi-turn reasoning datasets.

**Authors**: Surajit Majumder, Paritosh Ranjan, Prodip Roy, Bhuban Padhan

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:39:42Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces decentralized and modular neural network framework designed to enhance the scalability, interpretability, and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. At the heart of this framework is a dynamic switch mechanism that governs the selective activation and training of individual neurons based on input characteristics, allowing neurons to specialize in distinct segments of the data domain. This approach enables neurons to learn from disjoint subsets of data, mimicking biological brain function by promoting task specialization and improving the interpretability of neural network behavior. Furthermore, the paper explores the application of federated learning and decentralized training for real-world AI deployments, particularly in edge computing and distributed environments. By simulating localized training on non-overlapping data subsets, we demonstrate how modular networks can be efficiently trained and evaluated. The proposed framework also addresses scalability, enabling AI systems to handle large datasets and distributed processing while preserving model transparency and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the potential of this approach in advancing the design of scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient AI systems for diverse applications.

### "Two Means to an End Goal": Connecting Explainability and Contestability   in the Regulation of Public Sector AI
**Authors**: Timothée Schmude, Mireia Yurrita, Kars Alfrink, Thomas Le Goff, Tiphaine Viard

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:34:00Z

**Summary**: Explainability and its emerging counterpart contestability have become important normative and design principles for the trustworthy use of AI as they enable users and subjects to understand and challenge AI decisions. However, the regulation of AI systems spans technical, legal, and organizational dimensions, producing a multiplicity in meaning that complicates the implementation of explainability and contestability. Resolving this conceptual ambiguity requires specifying and comparing the meaning of both principles across regulation dimensions, disciplines, and actors. This process, here defined as translation, is essential to provide guidance on the principles' realization. We present the findings of a semi-structured interview study with 14 interdisciplinary AI regulation experts. We report on the experts' understanding of the intersection between explainability and contestability in public AI regulation, their advice for a decision subject and a public agency in a welfare allocation AI use case, and their perspectives on the connections and gaps within the research landscape. We provide differentiations between descriptive and normative explainability, judicial and non-judicial channels of contestation, and individual and collective contestation action. We further outline three translation processes in the alignment of top-down and bottom-up regulation, the assignment of responsibility for interpreting regulations, and the establishment of interdisciplinary collaboration. Our contributions include an empirically grounded conceptualization of the intersection between explainability and contestability and recommendations on implementing these principles in public institutions. We believe our contributions can inform policy-making and regulation of these core principles and enable more effective and equitable design, development, and deployment of trustworthy public AI systems.

**Authors**: Pierre-Carl Langlais, Pavel Chizhov, Mattia Nee, Carlos Rosas Hinostroza, Matthieu Delsart, Irène Girard, Othman Hicheur, Anastasia Stasenko, Ivan P. Yamshchikov

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T10:17:04Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new generation of small reasoning models for RAG, search, and source summarization. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.

### Whole-body End-Effector Pose Tracking
**Authors**: Tifanny Portela, Andrei Cramariuc, Mayank Mittal, Marco Hutter

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:59:56Z

**Summary**: Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.

### HALO: Hardware-aware quantization with low critical-path-delay weights   for LLM acceleration
**Authors**: Rohan Juneja, Shivam Aggarwal, Safeen Huda, Tulika Mitra, Li-Shiuan Peh

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:54:59Z

**Summary**: Quantization is critical for efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs). Yet conventional methods remain hardware-agnostic, limited to bit-width constraints, and do not account for intrinsic circuit characteristics such as the timing behaviors and energy profiles of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units. This disconnect from circuit-level behavior limits the ability to exploit available timing margins and energy-saving opportunities, reducing the overall efficiency of deployment on modern accelerators.   To address these limitations, we propose HALO, a versatile framework for Hardware-Aware Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). Unlike traditional methods, HALO explicitly incorporates detailed hardware characteristics, including critical-path timing and power consumption, into its quantization approach. HALO strategically selects weights with low critical-path-delays enabling higher operational frequencies and dynamic frequency scaling without disrupting the architecture's dataflow. Remarkably, HALO achieves these improvements with only a few dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) adjustments, ensuring simplicity and practicality in deployment. Additionally, by reducing switching activity within the MAC units, HALO effectively lowers energy consumption. Evaluations on accelerators such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) demonstrate that HALO significantly enhances inference efficiency, achieving average performance improvements of 270% and energy savings of 51% over baseline quantization methods, all with minimal impact on accuracy.

### Data-Driven Calibration of Prediction Sets in Large Vision-Language   Models Based on Inductive Conformal Prediction
**Authors**: Yuanchang Ye, Weiyan Wen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:34:59Z

**Summary**: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

### Copper-impurity-free photonic integrated circuits enable deterministic   soliton microcombs
**Authors**: Xinru Ji, Xurong Li, Zheru Qiu, Rui Ning Wang, Marta Divall, Andrey Gelash, Grigory Lihachev, Tobias J. Kippenberg

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:18:52Z

**Summary**: Chip-scale optical frequency combs based on microresonators (microcombs) enable GHz-THz repetition rates, broad bandwidth, compactness, and compatibility with wafer-scale manufacturing. Silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits have become a leading platform due to their low loss, broad transparency, lithographic dispersion control, and commercial 200-mm-wafer foundry access. They have enabled system-level applications in optical communications, LiDAR, frequency synthesis, low-noise microwave generation, and convolutional processing. However, real-world deployment is hindered by the challenge of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to thermal instabilities. Although techniques like pulsed pumping, fast scanning, and auxiliary lasers help mitigate these effects, they often add complexity or reduce soliton stability. In this work, we overcome thermal limitations and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in silicon nitride photonic circuits. We trace the thermal effects to copper impurities within waveguides, originating from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade silicon wafers that are gettered into silicon nitride during fabrication. By developing effective copper removal techniques, we significantly reduce thermal instabilities. This enables soliton generation with arbitrary or slow laser scanning, removing a key barrier to microcomb deployment. Our approach is compatible with front-end-of-line foundry processing, paving the way for broader adoption of soliton microcomb technologies.

### Robust Kernel Hypothesis Testing under Data Corruption
**Authors**: Antonin Schrab, Ilmun Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T09:16:54Z

**Summary**: We propose a general method for constructing robust permutation tests under data corruption. The proposed tests effectively control the non-asymptotic type I error under data corruption, and we prove their consistency in power under minimal conditions. This contributes to the practical deployment of hypothesis tests for real-world applications with potential adversarial attacks. For the two-sample and independence settings, we show that our kernel robust tests are minimax optimal, in the sense that they are guaranteed to be non-asymptotically powerful against alternatives uniformly separated from the null in the kernel MMD and HSIC metrics at some optimal rate (tight with matching lower bound). We point out that existing differentially private tests can be adapted to be robust to data corruption, and we demonstrate in experiments that our proposed tests achieve much higher power than these private tests. Finally, we provide publicly available implementations and empirically illustrate the practicality of our robust tests.

**Authors**: Yilin Zhai, Hongyuan Shi, Chao Zhan, Qing Wang, Zaijin You, Nan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:51:09Z

**Summary**: Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal resilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine learning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a large language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized for wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to historical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the Northwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1) 14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to PatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units; (2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3) sustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4) demonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12) against specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling paradigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both computationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex geophysical systems modeling.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:29:00Z

**Summary**: We introduce PerfCam, an open source Proof-of-Concept (PoC) digital twinning framework that combines camera and sensory data with 3D Gaussian Splatting and computer vision models for digital twinning, object tracking, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) extraction in industrial production lines. By utilizing 3D reconstruction and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), PerfCam offers a semi-automated approach to object tracking and spatial mapping, enabling digital twins that capture real-time KPIs such as availability, performance, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), and rate of conveyor belts in the production line. We validate the effectiveness of PerfCam through a practical deployment within realistic test production lines in the pharmaceutical industry and contribute an openly published dataset to support further research and development in the field. The results demonstrate PerfCam's ability to deliver actionable insights through its precise digital twin capabilities, underscoring its value as an effective tool for developing usable digital twins in smart manufacturing environments and extracting operational analytics.

### BackSlash: Rate Constrained Optimized Training of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jun Wu, Jiangtao Wen, Yuxing Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:26:21Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:15:51Z

**Summary**: Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.

### Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Simplified Design for Uniform   Service Quality
**Authors**: Wei Jiang, Hans Dieter Schotten

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:07:42Z

**Summary**: In traditional cellular networks, users at the cell edge often suffer from poor quality of service (QoS) due to large distance-dependent path loss and severe inter-cell interference. While cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-out (MIMO) mitigates this issue by distributing access points (APs) to ensure uniform QoS, the deployment of numerous distributed APs and a fronthaul network incurs high infrastructure costs. To balance performance and cost efficiency, this article proposes a simplified design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) massive MIMO. The key idea is to reduce the number of APs, thus minimizing the scale of the fronthaul network. The antennas from the decommissioned APs are aggregated at a central base station (cBS), which also serves as the coordinator for distributed APs. We derive closed-form expressions for uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) for HCF, CF, and cellular massive MIMO under pilot contamination and correlated fading channels, considering the use of multi-antenna APs. Numerical results confirm that the hierarchical architecture achieves $95\%$-likely per-user SE comparable to CF, enhancing cell-edge user rates in cellular systems by over 100 times, while significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the fronthaul network in CF. We develop max-min fairness algorithms for joint power control of the cBS and APs in the downlink, and the users in the uplink. These algorithms not only boost fairness and system capacity but also dramatically lower transmission power, e.g., achieving over $70\%$ savings in uplink, particularly beneficial for battery-powered mobile devices.

### EcoServe: Enabling Cost-effective LLM Serving with Proactive Intra- and   Inter-Instance Orchestration
**Authors**: Jiangsu Du, Hongbin Zhang, Taosheng Wei, Zhenyi Zheng, Kaiyi Wu, Zhiguang Chen, Yutong Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T08:06:22Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM serving strategies can be categorized based on whether prefill and decode phases are disaggregated: non-disaggregated (NoDG) or fully disaggregated (FuDG). However, the NoDG strategy leads to strong prefill-decode interference and the FuDG strategy highly relies on high-performance interconnects, making them less cost-effective.   We introduce EcoServe, a system that enables cost-effective LLM serving on clusters with commodity interconnects. EcoServe is built on the partially disaggregated (PaDG) strategy, applying temporal disaggregation and rolling activation for proactive intra- and inter-instance scheduling. It first disaggregates the prefill and decode phases along the time dimension within a single instance to mitigate inter-phase interference and enhance throughput. Next, it coordinates multiple instances and cyclically activates them to ensure the continuous availability of prefill processing, thereby improving latency. Thus, EcoServe's basic serving unit is the macro instance, within which multiple instances collaborate. It further integrates an adaptive scheduling algorithm to route requests in a macro instance and a mitosis scaling approach to enable fine-grained capacity scaling. Beyond delivering high goodput, EcoServe excels in load balancing, hardware cost, parallelism compatibility, and even engineering simplicity compared to existing solutions.   When serving 30B- and 70B-scale models on a production-level cluster with 32 NVIDIA L20 GPUs using commodity Ethernet, EcoServe averagely improves goodput by 82.49%, 86.17%, 122.76%, and 126.96% over four representative NoDG and FuDG systems.

### NoEsis: Differentially Private Knowledge Transfer in Modular LLM   Adaptation
**Authors**: Rob Romijnders, Stefanos Laskaridis, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Hamed Haddadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:56:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLM) are typically trained on vast amounts of data from various sources. Even when designed modularly (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts), LLMs can leak privacy on their sources. Conversely, training such models in isolation arguably prohibits generalization. To this end, we propose a framework, NoEsis, which builds upon the desired properties of modularity, privacy, and knowledge transfer. NoEsis integrates differential privacy with a hybrid two-staged parameter-efficient fine-tuning that combines domain-specific low-rank adapters, acting as experts, with common prompt tokens, acting as a knowledge-sharing backbone. Results from our evaluation on CodeXGLUE showcase that NoEsis can achieve provable privacy guarantees with tangible knowledge transfer across domains, and empirically show protection against Membership Inference Attacks. Finally, on code completion tasks, NoEsis bridges at least 77% of the accuracy gap between the non-shared and the non-private baseline.

### Pre-DPO: Improving Data Utilization in Direct Preference Optimization   Using a Guiding Reference Model
**Authors**: Junshu Pan, Wei Shen, Shulin Huang, Qiji Zhou, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:47:16Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.

### Revisiting Locally Differentially Private Protocols: Towards Better   Trade-offs in Privacy, Utility, and Attack Resistance
**Authors**: Héber H. Arcolezi, Sébastien Gambs

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:40:09Z

**Summary**: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) offers strong privacy protection, especially in settings in which the server collecting the data is untrusted. However, designing LDP mechanisms that achieve an optimal trade-off between privacy, utility and robustness to adversarial inference attacks remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a general multi-objective optimization framework for refining LDP protocols, enabling the joint optimization of privacy and utility under various adversarial settings. While our framework is flexible to accommodate multiple privacy and security attacks as well as utility metrics, in this paper, we specifically optimize for Attacker Success Rate (ASR) under \emph{data reconstruction attack} as a concrete measure of privacy leakage and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a measure of utility. More precisely, we systematically revisit these trade-offs by analyzing eight state-of-the-art LDP protocols and proposing refined counterparts that leverage tailored optimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed adaptive mechanisms consistently outperform their non-adaptive counterparts, achieving substantial reductions in ASR while preserving utility, and pushing closer to the ASR-MSE Pareto frontier. By bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world vulnerabilities, our framework enables modular and context-aware deployment of LDP mechanisms with tunable privacy-utility trade-offs.

**Authors**: Hanlin Sheng, Xinming Wu, Hang Gao, Haibin Di, Sergey Fomel, Jintao Li, Xu Si

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:35:21Z

**Summary**: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence, have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years, particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular, considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in the field.

### Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime   Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies
**Authors**: Chen Xu, Tony Khuong Nguyen, Emma Dixon, Christopher Rodriguez, Patrick Miller, Robert Lee, Paarth Shah, Rares Ambrus, Haruki Nishimura, Masha Itkina

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T07:12:28Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.

### Think, Prune, Train, Improve: Scaling Reasoning without Scaling Models
**Authors**: Caia Costello, Simon Guo, Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:48:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in programming and mathematical reasoning tasks, but are constrained by limited high-quality training data. Synthetic data can be leveraged to enhance fine-tuning outcomes, but several factors influence this process, including model size, synthetic data volume, pruning strategy, and number of fine-tuning rounds. We explore these axes and investigate which conditions enable model self-improvement. We introduce the Think, Prune, Train process, a scalable framework that iteratively fine-tunes models on their own reasoning traces, using ground-truth pruning to ensure high-quality training data. This approach yields improved performance: on GSM8K, Gemma2-2B achieves a Pass@1 of 57.6% (from 41.9%), Gemma2-9B reaches 82%, matching LLaMA-3.1-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B attains 91%, even surpassing GPT-4o, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-generated reasoning and systematic data selection for improving LLM capabilities.

**Authors**: Atharva Kulkarni, Yuan Zhang, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Xiou Ge, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Dhivya Piraviperumal, Swabha Swayamdipta, Hong Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:37:29Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

### A Case Study Exploring the Current Landscape of Synthetic Medical Record   Generation with Commercial LLMs
**Authors**: Yihan Lin, Zhirong Bella Yu, Simon Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:34:43Z

**Summary**: Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer a valuable opportunity to create privacy preserving and harmonized structured data, supporting numerous applications in healthcare. Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations, and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individuals privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize across different hospitals, a long standing issue in the field. In this work, we evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize across diverse hospital settings.

### Comparative Study on the Discourse Meaning of Chinese and English Media   in the Paris Olympics Based on LDA Topic Modeling Technology and LLM Prompt   Engineering
**Authors**: Yinglong Yu, Zhaopu Yao, Fang Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T06:23:55Z

**Summary**: This study analyzes Chinese and English media reports on the Paris Olympics using topic modeling, Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering, and corpus phraseology methods to explore similarities and differences in discourse construction and attitudinal meanings. Common topics include the opening ceremony, athlete performance, and sponsorship brands. Chinese media focus on specific sports, sports spirit, doping controversies, and new technologies, while English media focus on female athletes, medal wins, and eligibility controversies. Chinese reports show more frequent prepositional co-occurrences and positive semantic prosody in describing the opening ceremony and sports spirit. English reports exhibit positive semantic prosody when covering female athletes but negative prosody in predicting opening ceremony reactions and discussing women's boxing controversies.

### Leveraging Label Semantics and Meta-Label Refinement for Multi-Label   Question Classification
**Authors**: Shi Dong, Xiaobei Niu, Rui Zhong, Zhifeng Wang, Mingzhang Zuo

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:36:19Z

**Summary**: Accurate annotation of educational resources is crucial for effective personalized learning and resource recommendation in online education. However, fine-grained knowledge labels often overlap or share similarities, making it difficult for existing multi-label classification methods to differentiate them. The label distribution imbalance due to sparsity of human annotations further intensifies these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces RR2QC, a novel Retrieval Reranking method to multi-label Question Classification by leveraging label semantics and meta-label refinement. First, RR2QC improves the pre-training strategy by utilizing semantic relationships within and across label groups. Second, it introduces a class center learning task to align questions with label semantics during downstream training. Finally, this method decomposes labels into meta-labels and uses a meta-label classifier to rerank the retrieved label sequences. In doing so, RR2QC enhances the understanding and prediction capability of long-tail labels by learning from meta-labels that frequently appear in other labels. Additionally, a mathematical LLM is used to generate solutions for questions, extracting latent information to further refine the model's insights. Experimental results show that RR2QC outperforms existing methods in Precision@K and F1 scores across multiple educational datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for online education applications. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/78Erii/RR2QC.

### Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment
**Authors**: Leitian Tao, Yixuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:34:47Z

**Summary**: The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback.

### Random-Set Large Language Models
**Authors**: Muhammad Mubashar, Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Fabio Cuzzolin

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:25:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b, Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the capability to detect when its hallucinating.

**Authors**: Yuqiao Yang, Yongzhao Zhang, Wenhao Liu, Jun Li, Pengtao Shi, DingYu Zhong, Jie Yang, Ting Chen, Sheng Cao, Yuntao Ren, Yongyue Wu, Xiaosong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:19:02Z

**Summary**: As modern vehicles evolve into intelligent and connected systems, their growing complexity introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) has therefore become essential for managing these risks under mandatory regulations. However, existing TARA automation methods rely on static threat libraries, limiting their utility in the detailed, function-level analyses demanded by industry. This paper introduces DefenseWeaver, the first system that automates function-level TARA using component-specific details and large language models (LLMs). DefenseWeaver dynamically generates attack trees and risk evaluations from system configurations described in an extended OpenXSAM++ format, then employs a multi-agent framework to coordinate specialized LLM roles for more robust analysis. To further adapt to evolving threats and diverse standards, DefenseWeaver incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with expert-curated TARA reports. We validated DefenseWeaver through deployment in four automotive security projects, where it identified 11 critical attack paths, verified through penetration testing, and subsequently reported and remediated by the relevant automakers and suppliers. Additionally, DefenseWeaver demonstrated cross-domain adaptability, successfully applying to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and marine navigation systems. In comparison to human experts, DefenseWeaver outperformed manual attack tree generation across six assessment scenarios. Integrated into commercial cybersecurity platforms such as UAES and Xiaomi, DefenseWeaver has generated over 8,200 attack trees. These results highlight its ability to significantly reduce processing time, and its scalability and transformative impact on cybersecurity across industries.

### Stabilizing Reasoning in Medical LLMs with Continued Pretraining and   Reasoning Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Wataru Kawakami, Keita Suzuki, Junichiro Iwasawa

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:15:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first, Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:14:14Z

**Summary**: Recent Computer-Using Agents (CUAs), powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), offer a promising direction for automating complex desktop workflows through natural language. However, most existing CUAs remain conceptual prototypes, hindered by shallow OS integration, fragile screenshot-based interaction, and disruptive execution.   We present UFO2, a multiagent AgentOS for Windows desktops that elevates CUAs into practical, system-level automation. UFO2 features a centralized HostAgent for task decomposition and coordination, alongside a collection of application-specialized AppAgent equipped with native APIs, domain-specific knowledge, and a unified GUI--API action layer. This architecture enables robust task execution while preserving modularity and extensibility. A hybrid control detection pipeline fuses Windows UI Automation (UIA) with vision-based parsing to support diverse interface styles. Runtime efficiency is further enhanced through speculative multi-action planning, reducing per-step LLM overhead. Finally, a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) interface enables automation within an isolated virtual desktop, allowing agents and users to operate concurrently without interference.   We evaluate UFO2 across over 20 real-world Windows applications, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and execution accuracy over prior CUAs. Our results show that deep OS integration unlocks a scalable path toward reliable, user-aligned desktop automation.

### Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yuxiang Lai, Jike Zhong, Ming Li, Shitian Zhao, Xiaofeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:11:19Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.

### PropRAG: Guiding Retrieval with Beam Search over Proposition Paths
**Authors**: Jingjin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:47:34Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard non-parametric approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting common in continual learning. However, standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the interconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning (associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured RAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples, the inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework leveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm over proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains. Crucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without invoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and pre-computed embeddings. This avoids online LLM inference costs and potential inconsistencies during evidence gathering. LLMs are used effectively offline for high-quality proposition extraction and post-retrieval for answer generation. PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 results on PopQA (55.3%), 2Wiki (93.7%), HotpotQA (97.0%), and MuSiQue (77.3%), alongside top F1 scores (e.g., 52.4% on MuSiQue). By improving evidence retrieval through richer representation and explicit, LLM-free online path finding, PropRAG advances non-parametric continual learning.

### M4U: Evaluating Multilingual Understanding and Reasoning for Large   Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Jiayu Xu, Senwei Xie, Ruiping Wang, Jialin Li, Zhaojie Xie, Bin Zhang, Chuyan Xiong, Xilin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:37:45Z

**Summary**: Multilingual capability is an essential aspect for large multimodal models, since they are usually deployed across various countries and languages. However, most existing benchmarks for multilingual multimodal reasoning struggle to differentiate between models of varying performance; even language models without visual capabilities can easily achieve high scores. This leaves a comprehensive evaluation of leading multilingual multimodal models largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce M4U, a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing the capability of multi-discipline multilingual multimodal understanding and reasoning. M4U contains 10k samples covering 64 disciplines across 16 subfields in Science, Engineering, and Healthcare in six languages. Using M4U, we conduct extensive evaluations of leading Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools. The evaluation results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.6% average accuracy on M4U. Additionally, we observe that the leading LMMs exhibit significant language preferences. Our in-depth analysis indicates that leading LMMs, including GPT-4o, struggle to perform reasoning using multilingual information present in both visual and textual context. Specifically, they suffer performance degradation when prompted with cross-lingual multimodal questions. Our code and dataset is public available.

### LLM-Guided Open RAN: Empowering Hierarchical RAN Intelligent Control
**Authors**: Lingyan Bao, Sinwoong Yun, Jemin Lee, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T04:18:23Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a significant interest in deploying LLMempowered algorithms for wireless communication networks. Meanwhile, open radio access network (O-RAN) techniques offer unprecedented flexibility, with the non-real-time (non-RT) radio access network (RAN) intelligent controller (RIC) (non-RT RIC) and near-real-time (near-RT) RIC (near-RT RIC) components enabling intelligent resource management across different time scales. In this paper, we propose the LLM empowered hierarchical RIC (LLM-hRIC) framework to improve the collaboration between RICs. This framework integrates LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient network resource management. In this framework, LLMs-empowered non-RT RICs provide strategic guidance and high-level policies based on environmental context. Concurrently, RL-empowered near-RT RICs perform low-latency tasks based on strategic guidance and local near-RT observation. We evaluate the LLM-hRIC framework in an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network setting. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Finally, we discuss the key future challenges in applying LLMs to O-RAN.

### Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal Clinical Rationale Generation for Disease   Diagnosis with Small Language Models
**Authors**: Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Yida Xu, Yunya Song, Xian Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:53:34Z

**Summary**: Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack of domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable mutlimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in a same encoding space, enabling it naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

### Validating Network Protocol Parsers with Traceable RFC Document   Interpretation
**Authors**: Mingwei Zheng, Danning Xie, Qingkai Shi, Chengpeng Wang, Xiangyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:39:19Z

**Summary**: Validating the correctness of network protocol implementations is highly challenging due to the oracle and traceability problems. The former determines when a protocol implementation can be considered buggy, especially when the bugs do not cause any observable symptoms. The latter allows developers to understand how an implementation violates the protocol specification, thereby facilitating bug fixes. Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems into account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using recent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that network protocols are often released with structured specification documents, a.k.a. RFC documents, which can be systematically translated to formal protocol message specifications via LLMs. Such specifications, which may contain errors due to the hallucination of LLMs, are used as a quasi-oracle to validate protocol parsers, while the validation results in return gradually refine the oracle. Since the oracle is derived from the document, any bugs we find in a protocol implementation can be traced back to the document, thus addressing the traceability problem. We have extensively evaluated our approach using nine network protocols and their implementations written in C, Python, and Go. The results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and has detected 69 bugs, with 36 confirmed. The project also demonstrates the potential for fully automating software validation based on natural language specifications, a process previously considered predominantly manual due to the need to understand specification documents and derive expected outputs for test inputs.

**Authors**: Omid Veisi, Sasan Bahrami, Roman Englert, Claudia Müller

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:26:30Z

**Summary**: Using LLMs in healthcare, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing requires the examination of ethical and social norms to ensure safe incorporation into human life. We conducted a mixed-method study, including an online survey with 111 participants and an interview study with 38 experts, to investigate the AI ethics and social norms in ChatGPT as everyday life tools. This study aims to evaluate whether ChatGPT in an empirical context operates following ethics and social norms, which is critical for understanding actions in industrial and academic research and achieving machine ethics. The findings of this study provide initial insights into six important aspects of AI ethics, including bias, trustworthiness, security, toxicology, social norms, and ethical data. Significant obstacles related to transparency and bias in unsupervised data collection methods are identified as ChatGPT's ethical concerns.

### RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented   Generation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bang An, Shiyue Zhang, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:25:18Z

**Summary**: Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.

### MIND: Math Informed syNthetic Dialogues for Pretraining LLMs
**Authors**: Syeda Nahida Akter, Shrimai Prabhumoye, John Kamalu, Sanjeev Satheesh, Eric Nyberg, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:14:33Z

**Summary**: The utility of synthetic data to enhance pretraining data quality and hence to improve downstream task accuracy has been widely explored in recent large language models (LLMs). Yet, these approaches fall inadequate in complex, multi-hop and mathematical reasoning tasks as the synthetic data typically fails to add complementary knowledge to the existing raw corpus. In this work, we propose a novel large-scale and diverse Math Informed syNthetic Dialogue (MIND) generation method that improves the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs. Specifically, using MIND, we generate synthetic conversations based on OpenWebMath (OWM), resulting in a new math corpus, MIND-OWM. Our experiments with different conversational settings reveal that incorporating knowledge gaps between dialog participants is essential for generating high-quality math data. We further identify an effective way to format and integrate synthetic and raw data during pretraining to maximize the gain in mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the need to restructure raw data rather than use it as-is. Compared to pretraining just on raw data, a model pretrained on MIND-OWM shows significant boost in mathematical reasoning (GSM8K: +13.42%, MATH: +2.30%), including superior performance in specialized knowledge (MMLU: +4.55%, MMLU-STEM: +4.28%) and general purpose reasoning tasks (GENERAL REASONING: +2.51%).

### MultiMind: Enhancing Werewolf Agents with Multimodal Reasoning and   Theory of Mind
**Authors**: Zheng Zhang, Nuoqian Xiao, Qi Chai, Deheng Ye, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T03:12:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.

**Authors**: Yiwei Zha

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T02:29:56Z

**Summary**: Financial sectors are rapidly adopting language model technologies, yet evaluating specialized RAG systems in this domain remains challenging. This paper introduces SMARTFinRAG, addressing three critical gaps in financial RAG assessment: (1) a fully modular architecture where components can be dynamically interchanged during runtime; (2) a document-centric evaluation paradigm generating domain-specific QA pairs from newly ingested financial documents; and (3) an intuitive interface bridging research-implementation divides. Our evaluation quantifies both retrieval efficacy and response quality, revealing significant performance variations across configurations. The platform's open-source architecture supports transparent, reproducible research while addressing practical deployment challenges faced by financial institutions implementing RAG systems.

### LRAGE: Legal Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation Tool
**Authors**: Minhu Park, Hongseok Oh, Eunkyung Choi, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:57:31Z

**Summary**: Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice. Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above. The source code is available at https://github.com/hoorangyee/LRAGE.

### RankFlow: A Multi-Role Collaborative Reranking Workflow Utilizing Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Can Jin, Hongwu Peng, Anxiang Zhang, Nuo Chen, Jiahui Zhao, Xi Xie, Kuangzheng Li, Shuya Feng, Kai Zhong, Caiwen Ding, Dimitris N. Metaxas

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:33:35Z

**Summary**: In an Information Retrieval (IR) system, reranking plays a critical role by sorting candidate passages according to their relevance to a specific query. This process demands a nuanced understanding of the variations among passages linked to the query. In this work, we introduce RankFlow, a multi-role reranking workflow that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and role specializations to improve reranking performance. RankFlow enlists LLMs to fulfill four distinct roles: the query Rewriter, the pseudo Answerer, the passage Summarizer, and the Reranker. This orchestrated approach enables RankFlow to: (1) accurately interpret queries, (2) draw upon LLMs' extensive pre-existing knowledge, (3) distill passages into concise versions, and (4) assess passages in a comprehensive manner, resulting in notably better reranking results. Our experimental results reveal that RankFlow outperforms existing leading approaches on widely recognized IR benchmarks, such as TREC-DL, BEIR, and NovelEval. Additionally, we investigate the individual contributions of each role in RankFlow. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/RankFlow

### TGDT: A Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin for Urban Traffic Corridors
**Authors**: Nooshin Yousefzadeh, Rahul Sengupta, Sanjay Ranka

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:28:32Z

**Summary**: Urban congestion at signalized intersections leads to significant delays, economic losses, and increased emissions. Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.

### Towards Optimal Circuit Generation: Multi-Agent Collaboration Meets   Collective Intelligence
**Authors**: Haiyan Qin, Jiahao Feng, Xiaotong Feng, Wei W. Xing, Wang Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:27:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed code generation, yet their application in hardware design produces gate counts 38\%--1075\% higher than human designs. We present CircuitMind, a multi-agent framework that achieves human-competitive efficiency through three key innovations: syntax locking (constraining generation to basic logic gates), retrieval-augmented generation (enabling knowledge-driven design), and dual-reward optimization (balancing correctness with efficiency). To evaluate our approach, we introduce TC-Bench, the first gate-level benchmark harnessing collective intelligence from the TuringComplete ecosystem -- a competitive circuit design platform with hundreds of thousands of players. Experiments show CircuitMind enables 55.6\% of model implementations to match or exceed top-tier human experts in composite efficiency metrics. Most remarkably, our framework elevates the 14B Phi-4 model to outperform both GPT-4o mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving efficiency comparable to the top 25\% of human experts without requiring specialized training. These innovations establish a new paradigm for hardware optimization where collaborative AI systems leverage collective human expertise to achieve optimal circuit designs. Our model, data, and code are open-source at https://github.com/BUAA-CLab/CircuitMind.

### ReasoningV: Efficient Verilog Code Generation with Adaptive Hybrid   Reasoning Model
**Authors**: Haiyan Qin, Zhiwei Xie, Jingjing Li, Liangchen Li, Xiaotong Feng, Junzhan Liu, Wang Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:27:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Verilog code generation significantly, yet face challenges in data quality, reasoning capabilities, and computational efficiency. This paper presents ReasoningV, a novel model employing a hybrid reasoning strategy that integrates trained intrinsic capabilities with dynamic inference adaptation for Verilog code generation. Our framework introduces three complementary innovations: (1) ReasoningV-5K, a high-quality dataset of 5,000 functionally verified instances with reasoning paths created through multi-dimensional filtering of PyraNet samples; (2) a two-stage training approach combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundational knowledge with full-parameter optimization for enhanced reasoning; and (3) an adaptive reasoning mechanism that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on problem complexity, reducing token consumption by up to 75\% while preserving performance. Experimental results demonstrate ReasoningV's effectiveness with a pass@1 accuracy of 57.8\% on VerilogEval-human, achieving performance competitive with leading commercial models like Gemini-2.0-flash (59.5\%) and exceeding the previous best open-source model by 10.4 percentage points. ReasoningV offers a more reliable and accessible pathway for advancing AI-driven hardware design automation, with our model, data, and code available at https://github.com/BUAA-CLab/ReasoningV.

### Nearest Neighbor Speculative Decoding for LLM Generation and Attribution
**Authors**: Minghan Li, Xilun Chen, Ari Holtzman, Beidi Chen, Jimmy Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Xi Victoria Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T01:08:35Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate and lack the ability to provide attribution for their generations. Semi-parametric LMs, such as kNN-LM, approach these limitations by refining the output of an LM for a given prompt using its nearest neighbor matches in a non-parametric data store. However, these models often exhibit slow inference speeds and produce non-fluent texts. In this paper, we introduce Nearest Neighbor Speculative Decoding (NEST), a novel semi-parametric language modeling approach that is capable of incorporating real-world text spans of arbitrary length into the LM generations and providing attribution to their sources. NEST performs token-level retrieval at each inference step to compute a semi-parametric mixture distribution and identify promising span continuations in a corpus. It then uses an approximate speculative decoding procedure that accepts a prefix of the retrieved span or generates a new token. NEST significantly enhances the generation quality and attribution rate of the base LM across a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks, surpassing the conventional kNN-LM method and performing competitively with in-context retrieval augmentation. In addition, NEST substantially improves the generation speed, achieving a 1.8x speedup in inference time when applied to Llama-2-Chat 70B. Code will be released at https://github.com/facebookresearch/NEST/tree/main.

### Streaming, Fast and Slow: Cognitive Load-Aware Streaming for Efficient   LLM Serving
**Authors**: Chang Xiao, Brenda Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:58:37Z

**Summary**: Generative conversational interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) typically stream output token-by-token at a rate determined by computational budget, often neglecting actual human reading speeds and the cognitive load associated with the content. This mismatch frequently leads to inefficient use of computational resources. For example, in cloud-based services, streaming content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing computational resources for other users. Our statistical analysis of computational savings, combined with crowdsourced user studies, provides insights into the trade-offs between service efficiency and user satisfaction, demonstrating that our method can significantly reduce computational consumption up to 16.8\%. This context-aware computational resource management strategy presents a practical framework for enhancing system efficiency in cloud-based conversational AI interfaces without compromising user experience.

### Chatperone: An LLM-Based Negotiable Scaffolding System for Mediating   Adolescent Mobile Interactions
**Authors**: Suwon Yoon, Seungwon Yang, Jeongwon Choi, Wonjeong Park, Inseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:45:41Z

**Summary**: Adolescents' uncontrolled exposure to digital content can negatively impact their development. Traditional regulatory methods, such as time limits or app restrictions, often take a rigid approach, ignoring adolescents' decision-making abilities. Another issue is the lack of content and services tailored for adolescents. To address this, we propose Chatperone, a concept of a system that provides adaptive scaffolding to support adolescents. Chatperone fosters healthy mobile interactions through three key modules: Perception, Negotiation, and Moderation. This paper outlines these modules' functionalities and discusses considerations for real-world implementation.

### Back to Fundamentals: Low-Level Visual Features Guided Progressive Token   Pruning
**Authors**: Yuanbing Ouyang, Yizhuo Liang, Qingpeng Li, Xinfei Guo, Yiming Luo, Di Wu, Hao Wang, Yushan Pan

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:43:20Z

**Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic segmentation but demand significant computation, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Existing token pruning methods often overlook fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no architectural changes or additional training. Evaluations across multiple datasets show 20%-45% computational reductions with negligible performance loss, outperforming existing methods in balancing cost and accuracy, especially in complex edge regions.

### Improving LLM Personas via Rationalization with Psychological Scaffolds
**Authors**: Brihi Joshi, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Tim Paek

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:36:39Z

**Summary**: Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a user's preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas -- based solely on a user's demographic attributes and/or prior judgments -- fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments. We introduce PB&J (Psychology of Behavior and Judgments), a framework that improves LLM personas by incorporating rationales of why a user might make specific judgments. These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about a user's behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds -- structured frameworks grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World Beliefs -- that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently outperform methods using only a user's demographics and/or judgments. Additionally, LLM personas constructed using scaffolds describing user beliefs perform competitively with those using human-written rationales.

### Papers-to-Posts: Supporting Detailed Long-Document Summarization with an   Interactive LLM-Powered Source Outline
**Authors**: Marissa Radensky, Daniel S. Weld, Joseph Chee Chang, Pao Siangliulue, Jonathan Bragg

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:10:42Z

**Summary**: Compressing long and technical documents (e.g., >10 pages) into shorter-form articles (e.g., <2 pages) is critical for communicating information to different audiences, for example, blog posts of scientific research paper or legal briefs of dense court proceedings. While large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for condensing large amounts of text, current interfaces to these models lack support for understanding and controlling what content is included in a detailed summarizing article. Such capability is especially important for detail- and technical-oriented domains, in which tactical selection and coherent synthesis of key details is critical for effective communication to the target audience. For this, we present interactive reverse source outlines, a novel mechanism for controllable long-form summarization featuring outline bullet points with automatic point selections that the user can iteratively adjust to obtain an article with the desired content coverage. We implement this mechanism in Papers-to-Posts, a new LLM-powered system for authoring research-paper blog posts. Through a within-subjects lab study (n=20) and a between-subjects deployment study (n=37 blog posts, 26 participants), we compare Papers-to-Posts to a strong baseline tool that provides an LLM-generated draft and access to free-form prompting. Under time constraints, Papers-to-Posts significantly increases writer satisfaction with blog post quality, particularly with respect to content coverage. Furthermore, quantitative results showed an increase in editing power (change in text for an amount of time or writing actions) while using Papers-to-Posts, and qualitative results showed that participants found incorporating key research-paper insights in their blog posts easier while using Papers-to-Posts.

### Optimism, Expectation, or Sarcasm? Multi-Class Hope Speech Detection in   Spanish and English
**Authors**: Sabur Butt, Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi, Ahmad Imam Amjad, Maaz Amjad, Hector G. Ceballos, Salud Maria Jimenez-Zafra

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T23:00:46Z

**Summary**: Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs, especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.

### FaithEval: Can Your Language Model Stay Faithful to Context, Even If   "The Moon is Made of Marshmallows"
**Authors**: Yifei Ming, Senthil Purushwalkam, Shrey Pandit, Zixuan Ke, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T22:33:02Z

**Summary**: Ensuring faithfulness to context in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world applications, as incorrect or unsupported information can erode user trust. Despite advancements on standard benchmarks, faithfulness hallucination-where models generate responses misaligned with the provided context-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce FaithEval, a novel and comprehensive benchmark tailored to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs in contextual scenarios across three diverse tasks: unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where retrieval mechanisms may surface incomplete, contradictory, or fabricated information. FaithEval comprises 4.9K high-quality problems in total, validated through a rigorous four-stage context construction and validation framework, employing both LLM-based auto-evaluation and human validation. Our extensive study across a wide range of open-source and proprietary models reveals that even state-of-the-art models often struggle to remain faithful to the given context, and that larger models do not necessarily exhibit improved faithfulness.Project is available at: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FaithEval.

### LLM Agent Swarm for Hypothesis-Driven Drug Discovery
**Authors**: Kevin Song, Andrew Trotter, Jake Y. Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T22:27:50Z

**Summary**: Drug discovery remains a formidable challenge: more than 90 percent of candidate molecules fail in clinical evaluation, and development costs often exceed one billion dollars per approved therapy. Disparate data streams, from genomics and transcriptomics to chemical libraries and clinical records, hinder coherent mechanistic insight and slow progress. Meanwhile, large language models excel at reasoning and tool integration but lack the modular specialization and iterative memory required for regulated, hypothesis-driven workflows. We introduce PharmaSwarm, a unified multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialized LLM "agents" to propose, validate, and refine hypotheses for novel drug targets and lead compounds. Each agent accesses dedicated functionality--automated genomic and expression analysis; a curated biomedical knowledge graph; pathway enrichment and network simulation; interpretable binding affinity prediction--while a central Evaluator LLM continuously ranks proposals by biological plausibility, novelty, in silico efficacy, and safety. A shared memory layer captures validated insights and fine-tunes underlying submodels over time, yielding a self-improving system. Deployable on low-code platforms or Kubernetes-based microservices, PharmaSwarm supports literature-driven discovery, omics-guided target identification, and market-informed repurposing. We also describe a rigorous four-tier validation pipeline spanning retrospective benchmarking, independent computational assays, experimental testing, and expert user studies to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and real-world impact. By acting as an AI copilot, PharmaSwarm can accelerate translational research and deliver high-confidence hypotheses more efficiently than traditional pipelines.
