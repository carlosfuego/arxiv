**Authors**: Bobby Xiong, Davide Fioriti, Fabian Neumann, Iegor Riepin, Tom Brown

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:26:50Z

**Summary**: This paper provides the background, methodology and validation for constructing a representation of the European high-voltage grid, including and above 200 kV, based on public data provided by OpenStreetMap. The model-independent grid dataset is published under the Open Data Commons Open Database (ODbL 1.0) licence and can be used for large-scale electricity as well as energy system modelling. The dataset and workflow are provided as part of PyPSA-Eur -- an open-source, sector-coupled optimisation model of the European energy system. By integrating with the codebase for initiatives such as PyPSA-Earth, the value of open and maintainable high-voltage grid data extends to the global context. By accessing the latest data through the the Overpass turbo API, the dataset can be easily reconstructed and updated within minutes. To assess the data quality, this paper further compares the dataset with official statistics and representative model runs using PyPSA-Eur based on different electricity grid representations.

**Authors**: Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bui1dMySea/MemLong

### Smart Helper-Aided F-RANs: Improving Delay and Reducing Fronthaul Load
**Authors**: Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh, Mohammed S. Al-Abiad, Md Jahangir Hossain, Julian Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:43:26Z

**Summary**: In traditional Fog-Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) are connected to a macro base station (MBS) through fronthaul links. Deploying a massive number of eRRHs is not always feasible due to site constraints and the cost of fronthaul links. This paper introduces an innovative concept of using smart helpers (SHs) in F-RANs. These SHs do not require fronthaul links and listen to the nearby eRRHs' communications. Then, they smartly select and cache popular content. This capability enables SHs to serve users with frequent on-demand service requests potentially. As such, network operators have the flexibility to easily deploy SHs in various scenarios, such as dense urban areas and temporary public events, to expand their F-RANs and improve the quality of service (QoS). To study the performance of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the average transmission delay that jointly optimizes cache resources and user scheduling. To tackle the formulated problem, we develop an innovative multi-stage algorithm that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Various performance measures, e.g., the average transmission delay, fronthaul load, and cache hit rate of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN are evaluated numerically and compared with those of traditional F-RANs.

### VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths   Vision Computation
**Authors**: Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:48:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### LightSLH: Provable and Low-Overhead Spectre v1 Mitigation through   Targeted Instruction Hardening
**Authors**: Yiming Zhu, Wenchao Huang, Yan Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T02:31:28Z

**Summary**: Several software mitigations have been proposed to defend against Spectre vulnerabilities. However, these countermeasures often suffer from high performance overhead, largely due to unnecessary protections. We propose LightSLH, designed to mitigate this overhead by hardening instructions only when they are under threat from Spectre vulnerabilities. LightSLH leverages program analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to identify all instructions that could potentially lead to Spectre vulnerabilities and provides provable protection. To enhance analysis efficiency and precision, LightSLH employs novel taint and value domains. The taint domain enables bit-level taint tracking, while the value domain allows LightSLH to analyze complex program structures such as pointers and structures. Furthermore, LightSLH uses a two-stage abstract interpretation approach to circumvent potential analysis paralysis issues.   We demonstrate the security guarantees of LightSLH and evaluate its performance on cryptographic algorithm implementations from OpenSSL. LightSLH significantly reduces the overhead associated with speculative-load-hardening techniques. Our results show that LightSLH introduces no protection and thus no overhead on 4 out of the 7 studied algorithms, which contrasts with existing countermeasures that introduce additional overhead due to unnecessary hardening. Additionally, LightSLH performs, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the security guarantees of RSA against Spectre v1, highlighting that the memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm depend on secrets, even for observers at the cache line granularity, necessitating protection for such accesses.

### RIP Linked List
**Authors**: Benoît Sonntag, Dominique Colnet

**Updated**: 2024-08-28T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming. However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly, execution speed. While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a challenge. This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark. Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based alternatives. We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for linked lists, enhancing their performance. Additionally, we introduce a new array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.

### Efficient LLM Training and Serving with Heterogeneous Context Sharding   among Attention Heads
**Authors**: Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T22:06:20Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

### Styx: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows
**Authors**: Kyriakos Psarakis, George Siachamis, George Christodoulou, Marios Fragkoulis, Asterios Katsifodimos

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T17:30:41Z

**Summary**: Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches either provide serializable transactional guarantees at the level of individual functions, or separate application logic from the state and use inefficient transactional protocols. These design choices increase the execution latency, limiting the adoption of SFaaS systems.   In this paper, we present Styx, a novel SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions across functions with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol to support an arbitrary call graph of stateful functions. It introduces a transaction-execution acknowledgment scheme that allows tracking a transactional workflow's SFaaS calls, guaranteeing atomicity and exactly-once processing. Finally, Styx features a function-execution caching mechanism and early transactional commit replies for optimized performance. Experiments with the YCSB-T, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.

### Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context   Retrieval
**Authors**: Melisa Russak, Umar Jamil, Christopher Bryant, Kiran Kamble, Axel Magnuson, Mateusz Russak, Waseem AlShikh

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T09:34:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

### PPVF: An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Online Video Fetching Framework   with Correlated Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T02:03:36Z

**Summary**: Online video streaming has evolved into an integral component of the contemporary Internet landscape. Yet, the disclosure of user requests presents formidable privacy challenges. As users stream their preferred online videos, their requests are automatically seized by video content providers, potentially leaking users' privacy.   Unfortunately, current protection methods are not well-suited to preserving user request privacy from content providers while maintaining high-quality online video services. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Privacy-Preserving Video Fetching (PPVF) framework, which utilizes trusted edge devices to pre-fetch and cache videos, ensuring the privacy of users' requests while optimizing the efficiency of edge caching. More specifically, we design PPVF with three core components: (1) \textit{Online privacy budget scheduler}, which employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select non-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative videos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to consider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \textit{Noisy video request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition to original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate request privacy. (3) \textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages federated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online fashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world video request traces from Tencent Video. The results demonstrate that PPVF effectively safeguards user request privacy while upholding high video caching performance.

### Quest: Query-Aware Sparsity for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jiaming Tang, Yilong Zhao, Kan Zhu, Guangxuan Xiao, Baris Kasikci, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T21:01:02Z

**Summary**: As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128K or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache selection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss. Code is available at http://github.com/mit-han-lab/Quest .

### Employing Artificial Intelligence to Steer Exascale Workflows with   Colmena
**Authors**: Logan Ward, J. Gregory Pauloski, Valerie Hayot-Sasson, Yadu Babuji, Alexander Brace, Ryan Chard, Kyle Chard, Rajeev Thakur, Ian Foster

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T17:21:19Z

**Summary**: Computational workflows are a common class of application on supercomputers, yet the loosely coupled and heterogeneous nature of workflows often fails to take full advantage of their capabilities. We created Colmena to leverage the massive parallelism of a supercomputer by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn from and adapt a workflow as it executes. Colmena allows scientists to define how their application should respond to events (e.g., task completion) as a series of cooperative agents. In this paper, we describe the design of Colmena, the challenges we overcame while deploying applications on exascale systems, and the science workflows we have enhanced through interweaving AI. The scaling challenges we discuss include developing steering strategies that maximize node utilization, introducing data fabrics that reduce communication overhead of data-intensive tasks, and implementing workflow tasks that cache costly operations between invocations. These innovations coupled with a variety of application patterns accessible through our agent-based steering model have enabled science advances in chemistry, biophysics, and materials science using different types of AI. Our vision is that Colmena will spur creative solutions that harness AI across many domains of scientific computing.

### Decision-Focused Learning to Predict Action Costs for Planning
**Authors**: Jayanta Mandi, Marco Foschini, Daniel Holler, Sylvie Thiebaux, Jorg Hoffmann, Tias Guns

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T11:29:07Z

**Summary**: In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.

### Trimma: Trimming Metadata Storage and Latency for Hybrid Memory Systems
**Authors**: Yiwei Li, Boyu Tian, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T07:26:27Z

**Summary**: Hybrid main memory systems combine both performance and capacity advantages from heterogeneous memory technologies. With larger capacities, higher associativities, and finer granularities, hybrid memory systems currently exhibit significant metadata storage and lookup overheads for flexibly remapping data blocks between the two memory tiers. To alleviate the inefficiencies of existing designs, we propose Trimma, the combination of a multi-level metadata structure and an efficient metadata cache design. Trimma uses a multi-level metadata table to only track truly necessary address remap entries. The saved memory space is effectively utilized as extra DRAM cache capacity to improve performance. Trimma also uses separate formats to store the entries with non-identity and identity address mappings. This improves the overall remap cache hit rate, further boosting the performance. Trimma is transparent to software and compatible with various types of hybrid memory systems. When evaluated on a representative hybrid memory system with HBM3 and DDR5, Trimma achieves up to 1.68$\times$ and on average 1.33$\times$ speedup benefits, compared to state-of-the-art hybrid memory designs. These results show that Trimma effectively addresses metadata management overheads, especially for future scalable large-scale hybrid memory architectures.

### RollingCache: Using Runtime Behavior to Defend Against Cache Side   Channel Attacks
**Authors**: Divya Ojha, Sandhya Dwarkadas

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T04:32:56Z

**Summary**: Shared caches are vulnerable to side channel attacks through contention in cache sets. Besides being a simple source of information leak, these side channels form useful gadgets for more sophisticated attacks that compromise the security of shared systems.   The fundamental design aspect that contention attacks exploit is the deterministic nature of the set of addresses contending for a cache set. In this paper, we present RollingCache, a cache design that defends against contention attacks by dynamically changing the set of addresses contending for cache sets. Unlike prior defenses, RollingCache does not rely on address encryption/decryption, data relocation, or cache partitioning. We use one level of indirection to implement dynamic mapping controlled by the whole-cache runtime behavior. Our solution does not depend on having defined security domains, and can defend against an attacker running on the same or another core.   We evaluate RollingCache on ChampSim using the SPEC-2017 benchmark suite. Our security evaluation shows that our dynamic mapping removes the deterministic ability to identify the source of contention. The performance evaluation shows an impact of 1.67\% over a mix of workloads, with a corresponding

### Decentralized Federated Learning with Model Caching on Mobile Agents
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Wang, Guojun Xiong, Houwei Cao, Jian Li, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T03:58:20Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a shared model using data and computation power on distributed agents coordinated by a central server. Decentralized FL (DFL) utilizes local model exchange and aggregation between agents to reduce the communication and computation overheads on the central server. However, when agents are mobile, the communication opportunity between agents can be sporadic, largely hindering the convergence and accuracy of DFL. In this paper, we study delay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on mobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of agents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange their own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation works on all models in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of DFL with cached models, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by caching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different DFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular network to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility, cache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, cached DFL converges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.

### Mobile Edge Computing Networks: Online Low-Latency and Fresh Service   Provisioning
**Authors**: Yuhan Yi, Guanglin Zhang, Hai Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-08-24T15:23:32Z

**Summary**: Edge service caching can significantly mitigate latency and reduce communication and computing overhead by fetching and initializing services (applications) from clouds. The freshness of cached service data is critical when providing satisfactory services to users, but has been overlooked in existing research efforts. In this paper, we study the online low-latency and fresh service provisioning in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Specifically, we jointly optimize the service caching, task offloading, and resource allocation without knowledge of future system information, which is formulated as a joint online long-term optimization problem. This problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we design a Lyapunov-based online framework that decouples the problem at temporal level into a series of per-time-slot subproblems. For each subproblem, we propose an online integrated optimization-deep reinforcement learning (OIODRL) method, which contains an optimization stage including a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) transformation and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and a learning stage including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the proposed OIODRL method achieves a near-optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark methods.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicDec/.

### Cyclic Wrap-Around Multi-Access Coded Caching with Private Caches
**Authors**: Dhruv Pratap Singh, Anjana A. Mahesh, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:39:20Z

**Summary**: We consider a variant of the coded caching problem where users connect to two types of caches, called private caches and access caches. The problem setting consists of a server having a library of files and a set of access caches. Every user, equipped with a private cache, connects to $L$ neighboring access caches in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. The server populates the private and access caches with file contents in either coded or uncoded format. For this setting, we derive a lower bound on the optimal worst-case transmission rate using cut-set arguments. This lower bound applies to both coded and uncoded placements. We then provide an achievable scheme with uncoded placement and show that our scheme specializes to the well-known Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme for the dedicated cache network in the absence of access caches. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves optimality in large memory regimes and provide numerical plots comparing the rate of the proposed scheme with the derived lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of our scheme.

**Authors**: Ali Gholami, Kai Wan, Tayyebeh Jahani-Nezhad, Hua Sun, Mingyue Ji, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:25:07Z

**Summary**: In a typical formulation of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem, a single user wishes to retrieve one out of $ K$ files from $N$ servers without revealing the demanded file index to any server. This paper formulates an extended model of PIR, referred to as multi-message private computation (MM-PC), where instead of retrieving a single file, the user wishes to retrieve $P>1$ linear combinations of files while preserving the privacy of the demand information. The MM-PC problem is a generalization of the private computation (PC) problem (where the user requests one linear combination of the files), and the multi-message private information retrieval (MM-PIR) problem (where the user requests $P>1$ files). A baseline achievable scheme repeats the optimal PC scheme by Sun and Jafar $P$ times, or treats each possible demanded linear combination as an independent file and then uses the near optimal MM-PIR scheme by Banawan and Ulukus. In this paper, we propose a new MM-PC scheme that significantly improves upon the baseline schemes. In doing so, we design the queries inspired by the structure in the cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval scheme by Wan {\it et al.}, which leverages the dependency between linear functions to reduce the amount of communications. To ensure the decodability of our scheme, we propose a new method to benefit from the existing dependency, referred to as the sign assignment step. In the end, we use Maximum Distance Separable matrices to code the queries, which allows the reduction of download from the servers, while preserving privacy. By the proposed schemes, we characterize the capacity within a multiplicative factor of $2$.

### Which Part of the Heap is Useful? Improving Heap Liveness Analysis
**Authors**: Vini Kanvar, Uday P. Khedker

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:54:22Z

**Summary**: With the growing sizes of data structures allocated in heap, understanding the actual use of heap memory is critically important for minimizing cache misses and reclaiming unused memory. A static analysis aimed at this is difficult because the heap locations are unnamed. Using allocation sites to name them creates very few distinctions making it difficult to identify allocated heap locations that are not used. Heap liveness analysis using access graphs solves this problem by (a) using a storeless model of heap memory by naming the locations with access paths, and (b) representing the unbounded sets of access paths (which are regular languages) as finite automata.   We improve the scalability and efficiency of heap liveness analysis, and reduce the amount of computed heap liveness information by using deterministic automata and by minimizing the inclusion of aliased access paths in the language. Practically, our field-, flow-, context-sensitive liveness analysis on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks scales to 36 kLoC (existing analysis scales to 10.5 kLoC) and improves efficiency even up to 99%. For some of the benchmarks, our technique shows multifold reduction in the computed liveness information, ranging from 2 to 100 times (in terms of the number of live access paths), without compromising on soundness.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. Jiménez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:56:29Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### Stable CoO$_2$ Nanoscrolls With Outstanding Electrical Properties
**Authors**: Simon Hettler, Kankona Singha Roy, Raul Arenal, Leela S. Panchakarla

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:47:49Z

**Summary**: Layered CoO$_2$ is of great interest for its promising properties but is meta-stable in its bulk form. CoO$_2$ was synthesized by converting the quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure of bulk Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ via a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting nanostructures were predominantly nanoscrolls with very thin walls, which exhibit long-term stability. A detailed structural investigation reveals that the CoO$_2$ is found to crystallize in monoclinic form, similar to the related CaCoO$_2$-CoO$_2$ misfit structure. Individual nanoscrolls are characterized electrically and show a p-type semiconducting nature with a high current-carrying capacity of 4$\cdot$10$^5$ A cm$^{-2}$ and an extremely high breakdown voltage of up to 270 kV/cm. The results demonstrate the possibility to stabilize meta-stable materials in low-dimensional forms and a promising application of the nanoscrolls as interconnect in high-voltage electronic circuitry.

### Rheological behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks under electric   fields: influence of concentration and voltage
**Authors**: Pedro C Rijo, Francisco J. Galindo-Rosales

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T10:26:26Z

**Summary**: This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.

### Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction
**Authors**: Xu Weng, KV Ling, Haochen Liu, Kun Cao

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T06:10:02Z

**Summary**: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.

### Telepathic Datacenters: Fast RPCs using Shared CXL Memory
**Authors**: Suyash Mahar, Ehsan Hajyjasini, Seungjin Lee, Zifeng Zhang, Mingyao Shen, Steven Swanson

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T04:16:49Z

**Summary**: Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast, efficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and hard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to communicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0 (CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using a cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.   RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities. RPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared memory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich data eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks provides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent updates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful and efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge with CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an entire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based communication.   Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\times$ and 7.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other RPC mechanisms across a range of workloads.

### QET: Enhancing Quantized LLM Parameters and KV cache Compression through   Element Substitution and Residual Clustering
**Authors**: Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T02:32:43Z

**Summary**: Matrix quantization compresses matrix elements into a more compact form to reduce storage requirements, with dequantization enabling reconstruction for use. We define the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the difference between the original and quantized matrices while ensuring the quantized matrix remains within fixed memory constraints. This technique is crucial in applications like Large Language Model (LLM) weight compression and KV cache compression, where large matrix sizes demand efficient storage solutions.   As modern LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT continue to grow, effective matrix compression is increasingly important. These models contain billions of parameters in matrix form, making efficient weight quantization essential for both storage and computational efficiency. Similarly, KV caches, storing intermediate inference results, are matrix-based and benefit significantly from optimized compression techniques.   To address the QEM problem in the context of LLM weight and KV cache compression, we propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET). QET leverages the local structure of matrix elements by iteratively swapping elements to create a locally ordered matrix, which is then grouped and quantized column by column. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: residual quantization to further reduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) and masking with batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Our experiments demonstrate that QET can reduce MSE to 12.3% of its original value at the same compression ratio, outperforming leading baseline methods. Our contributions include framing the QEM problem specifically for LLM and KV cache compression, developing the QET algorithm, and implementing optimizations that improve accuracy and processing speed.

### Hybrid Recurrent Models Support Emergent Descriptions for Hierarchical   Planning and Control
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T16:02:54Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Pluto and Charon: A Time and Memory Efficient Collaborative Edge AI   Framework for Personal LLMs Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Bei Ouyang, Shengyuan Ye, Liekang Zeng, Tianyi Qian, Jingyi Li, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T11:30:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.

### Heta: Distributed Training of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Yuchen Zhong, Junwei Su, Chuan Wu, Minjie Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T04:46:18Z

**Summary**: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) leverage diverse semantic relationships in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs) and have demonstrated remarkable learning performance in various applications. However, current distributed GNN training systems often overlook unique characteristics of HetGs, such as varying feature dimensions and the prevalence of missing features among nodes, leading to suboptimal performance or even incompatibility with distributed HGNN training. We introduce Heta, a framework designed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed HGNN training. Heta leverages the inherent structure of HGNNs - independent relation-specific aggregations for each relation, followed by a cross-relation aggregation - and advocates for a novel Relation-Aggregation-First computation paradigm. It performs relation-specific aggregations within graph partitions and then exchanges partial aggregations. This design, coupled with a new graph partitioning method that divides a HetG based on its graph schema and HGNN computation dependency, substantially reduces communication overhead. Heta further incorporates an innovative GPU feature caching strategy that accounts for the different cache miss-penalties associated with diverse node types. Comprehensive evaluations of various HGNN models and large heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that Heta outperforms state-of-the-art systems like DGL and GraphLearn by up to 5.8x and 2.3x in end-to-end epoch time, respectively.

### Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory
**Authors**: Olena Tkach, Gerd Schoenhense

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T15:47:17Z

**Summary**: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

### Abstract Environment Trimming
**Authors**: Daniel Jurjo-Rivas, Jose F. Morales, Pedro López-García, Manuel V. Hermenegildo

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T09:50:35Z

**Summary**: Variable sharing is a fundamental property in the static analysis of logic programs, since it is instrumental for ensuring correctness and increasing precision while inferring many useful program properties. Such properties include modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc. This has motivated significant work on developing abstract domains to improve the precision and performance of sharing analyses. Much of this work has centered around the family of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer. However, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic programs remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this work, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on developing techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address aspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the number of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired in others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression reassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken from both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the Spectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao system, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental results are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and, more importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half. As a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times.

### AdapMoE: Adaptive Sensitivity-based Expert Gating and Management for   Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Shuzhang Zhong, Ling Liang, Yuan Wang, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T03:27:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) without proportionally increasing the computational demands. However, their deployment on edge devices still faces significant challenges due to high on-demand loading overheads from managing sparsely activated experts. This paper introduces AdapMoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework for efficient MoE inference. AdapMoE features adaptive expert gating and management to reduce the on-demand loading overheads. We observe the heterogeneity of experts loading across layers and tokens, based on which we propose a sensitivity-based strategy to adjust the number of activated experts dynamically. Meanwhile, we also integrate advanced prefetching and cache management techniques to further reduce the loading latency. Through comprehensive evaluations on various platforms, we demonstrate AdapMoE consistently outperforms existing techniques, reducing the average number of activated experts by 25% and achieving a 1.35x speedup without accuracy degradation.

### Post-Training Sparse Attention with Double Sparsity
**Authors**: Shuo Yang, Ying Sheng, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Lianmin Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T17:27:17Z

**Summary**: The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces "Double Sparsity," a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/andy-yang-1/DoubleSparse.

### CMD: A Cache-assisted GPU Memory Deduplication Architecture
**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Dan Feng, Wei Tong, Xueliang Wei, Bing Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T13:54:46Z

**Summary**: Massive off-chip accesses in GPUs are the main performance bottleneck, and we divided these accesses into three types: (1) Write, (2) Data-Read, and (3) Read-Only. Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the inter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the traditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data. (3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are re-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the re-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 37.79%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 50.18%.

### Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T08:46:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T06:11:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their remarkable success across various tasks, which has led to the active development of a large set of diverse LLMs. However, individual LLMs have limitations when applied to complex tasks because of such factors as training biases, model sizes, and the datasets used. A promising approach is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM. This algorithm directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring they collectively provide the correct response efficiently. SelectLLM uses a multi-label classifier, utilizing the classifier's predictions and confidence scores to design optimal policies for selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings show that the proposed model outperforms individual LLMs and achieves competitive performance compared to similarly sized, computationally expensive top-performing LLM subsets. Specifically, with a similarly sized top-performing LLM subset, we achieve a significant reduction in latency on two standard reasoning benchmarks: 13% lower latency for GSM8K and 70% lower latency for MMLU. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive analyses and ablation studies, which validate the robustness of the proposed model.

### Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results
**Authors**: Giordan Escalona, Dylan McKellips, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T04:12:25Z

**Summary**: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

### ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs
**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-08-15T05:24:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### A Case for Enabling Delegation of 5G Core Decisions to the RAN
**Authors**: Lucas Vancina, Geoffrey Xie

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T23:42:46Z

**Summary**: Under conventional 5G system design, the authentication and continuous monitoring of user equipment (UE) demands a reliable backhaul connection between the radio access network (RAN) and the core network functions (AMF, AUSF, UDM, etc.). This is not a given, especially in disaster response and military operations. We propose that, in these scenarios, decisions made by core functions can be effectively delegated to the RAN by leveraging the RAN's computing resources and the micro-service programmability of the O-RAN system architecture. This paper presents several concrete designs of core-RAN decision delegation, including caching of core decisions and replicating some of the core decision logic. Each design has revealed interesting performance and security trade-offs that warrant further investigation.

### The Bicameral Cache: a split cache for vector architectures
**Authors**: Susana Rebolledo, Borja Perez, Jose Luis Bosque, Peter Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T09:18:02Z

**Summary**: The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

### At Least Factor-of-Two Optimization for RWLE-Based Homomorphic   Encryption
**Authors**: Jonathan Ly

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T05:42:35Z

**Summary**: Many modern applications that deal with sensitive data, such as healthcare and government services, outsource computation to cloud platforms. In such untrusted environments, privacy is of vital importance. One solution to this problem is homomorphic encryption (HE), a family of cryptographic schemes that support certain algebraic operations on encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, despite major advancements, encryption in modern HE schemes still comes with a non-trivial computational overhead that can hamper data-intensive workloads. To resolve this, recent research has shown that leveraging caching techniques, such as Rache, can significantly enhance the performance of HE schemes while maintaining security. Rache unfortunately displays a key limitation in the time complexity of its caching procedure, which scales with the size of the plaintext space. Smuche is another caching scheme that simultaneously improves the scalability of the caching procedure and turns the encryption process into a constant-time operation, utilizing only a single scalar multiplication. Even still, more can be done. In this paper, we present an encryption method we call ``Zinc" which entirely forgoes the multiple caching process, replacing it with a single scalar addition, and then injecting randomness that takes constant time with respect to the plaintext space. This injection of randomness is similar to Smuche, and a great improvement from Rache, allowing Zinc to achieve efficiency without compromising security. We implement the scheme using Microsoft SEAL and compare its performance to vanilla CKKS.

### Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter   Optimization
**Authors**: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:56:14Z

**Summary**: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.

### Ownership in low-level intermediate representation
**Authors**: Siddharth Priya, Arie Gurfinkel

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:31:34Z

**Summary**: The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.

### Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache   Consumption
**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:55:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

### Finch: Prompt-guided Key-Value Cache Compression
**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:08:55Z

**Summary**: Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

### Value-based Proactive Caching for Sensing Data in Internet of Vehicles
**Authors**: Yantong Wang, Ke Liu, Hui Ji, Jiande Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T08:46:30Z

**Summary**: Sensing data (SD) plays an important role in safe-related applications for Internet of Vehicles. Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios involving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching placement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the significance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer nonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

**Authors**: Riccardo Tedeschi, Luca Valente, Gianmarco Ottavi, Enrico Zelioli, Nils Wistoff, Massimiliano Giacometti, Abdul Basit Sajjad, Luca Benini, Davide Rossi

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T07:47:28Z

**Summary**: Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

### Correct Wrong Path

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T03:53:51Z

**Summary**: Modern OOO CPUs have very deep pipelines with large branch misprediction recovery penalties. Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can significantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects often employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage, which sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of magnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of thousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas. Despite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to adequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is nontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong path but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results and design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace driven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both the instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations ranging from $-3.05$\% to $20.9$\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the research community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces and tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces generated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without exposing industry IP.

### Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T16:35:10Z

**Summary**: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

### Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots
**Authors**: Zexin Li, Soroush Bateni, Cong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T08:07:28Z

**Summary**: Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T22:47:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

### ICGMM: CXL-enabled Memory Expansion with Intelligent Caching Using   Gaussian Mixture Model
**Authors**: Hanqiu Chen, Yitu Wang, Luis Vitorio Cargnini, Mohammadreza Soltaniyeh, Dongyang Li, Gongjin Sun, Pradeep Subedi, Andrew Chang, Yiran Chen, Cong Hao

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T19:17:46Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.

### Time-resolved measurement of neutron energy isotropy in a   sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch
**Authors**: R. A. Ryan, P. E. Tsai, A. R. Johansen, A. Youmans, D. P. Higginson, J. M. Mitrani, C. S. Adams, D. A. Sutherland, B. Levitt, U. Shumlak

**Updated**: 2024-08-09T16:48:01Z

**Summary**: Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

### NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at   Inference Time
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Guoxia Wang, Junyuan Shang, Shiyao Cui, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Dianhai Yu, Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-08T01:20:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL.

### A Comprehensive Survey on Edge Data Integrity Verification: Fundamentals   and Future Trends
**Authors**: Yao Zhao, Youyang Qu, Yong Xiang, Md Palash Uddin, Dezhong Peng, Longxiang Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T23:48:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

### Zero-Delay QKV Compression for Mitigating KV Cache and Network   Bottlenecks in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T22:10:26Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

### Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Xianglong Liu, Jing Liu, Yuhang Li, Jiwen Lu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T20:43:10Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

### mucAI at WojoodNER 2024: Arabic Named Entity Recognition with Nearest   Neighbor Search
**Authors**: Ahmed Abdou, Tasneem Mohsen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T09:34:55Z

**Summary**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

### Potential and Limitation of High-Frequency Cores and Caches
**Authors**: Kunal Pai, Anusheel Nand, Jason Lowe-Power

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T17:16:19Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the potential of cryogenic computing and superconducting electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at ultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics, operating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconducting technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

### LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning
**Authors**: Lekai Chen, Ashutosh Trivedi, Alvaro Velasquez

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T07:12:09Z

**Summary**: The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

### NVPC: A Transparent NVM Page Cache
**Authors**: Guoyu Wang, Xilong Che, Haoyang Wei, Shuo Chen, Puyi He, Juncheng Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T02:51:22Z

**Summary**: Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

### Electron-beam-induced modification of gold microparticles in an SEM
**Authors**: Kristina Weinel, Marc Benjamin Hahn, Axel Lubk, Wen Feng, Ignacio Gonzalez Martinez, Bernd Büchner, Leonardo Agudo Jácome

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T12:09:50Z

**Summary**: Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T09:07:06Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with   Hierarchical Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Zhuoming Chen, Xinyu Yang, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:58:04Z

**Summary**: With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

### Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongyu Mu, Yuzhang Wu, Yuchun Fan, Chenglong Wang, Hengyu Li, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:38:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

### Multi-Material Decomposition Using Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling
**Authors**: Xiao Jiang, Grace J. Gang, J. Webster Stayman

**Updated**: 2024-08-02T18:25:57Z

**Summary**: Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a <1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.

### Search-in-Memory (SiM): Reliable, Versatile, and Efficient Data Matching   in SSD's NAND Flash Memory Chip for Data Indexing Acceleration
**Authors**: Yun-Chih Chen, Yuan-Hao Chang, Tei-Wei Kuo

**Updated**: 2024-08-02T07:37:51Z

**Summary**: To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85% respectively.

### Caching Aided Multi-Tenant Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Chu Qiao, Cong Wang, Zhenkai Zhang, Yuede Ji, Xing Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T23:52:43Z

**Summary**: One key to enabling high-performance serverless computing is to mitigate cold-starts. Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.

### Do language models plan ahead for future tokens?
**Authors**: Wilson Wu, John X. Morris, Lionel Levine

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T21:21:28Z

**Summary**: Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.

### Intermittent Semi-working Mask: A New Masking Paradigm for LLMs
**Authors**: Mingcong Lu, Jiangcai Zhu, Wang Hao, Zheng Li, Shusheng Zhang, Kailai Shao, Chao Chen, Nan Li, Feng Wang, Xin Lu

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T13:22:01Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.

### MoE-Infinity: Offloading-Efficient MoE Model Serving
**Authors**: Leyang Xue, Yao Fu, Zhan Lu, Luo Mai, Mahesh Marina

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T13:21:24Z

**Summary**: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks.

### ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and   Two-Phase Partition
**Authors**: Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T07:51:25Z

**Summary**: Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

### CDFGNN: a Systematic Design of Cache-based Distributed Full-Batch Graph   Neural Network Training with Communication Reduction
**Authors**: Shuai Zhang, Zite Jiang, Haihang You

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T01:57:09Z

**Summary**: Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.

### Towards Variable-Length In-Network Caching
**Authors**: Gyuyeong Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T00:41:52Z

**Summary**: We present StarCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed workloads with various key and value sizes.

### A2SF: Accumulative Attention Scoring with Forgetting Factor for Token   Pruning in Transformer Decoder
**Authors**: Hyun-rae Jo, Dongkun Shin

**Updated**: 2024-07-31T02:02:40Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T21:27:00Z

**Summary**: The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE

**Authors**: Chi-Chih Chang, Wei-Cheng Lin, Chien-Yu Lin, Chong-Yan Chen, Yu-Fang Hu, Pei-Shuo Wang, Ning-Chi Huang, Luis Ceze, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T18:19:38Z

**Summary**: KV-Cache compression methods generally sample a KV-Cache of effectual tokens or quantize it into lower bits. However, these methods cannot exploit the redundancy of the hidden dimension of KV tensors. This paper investigates a unique hidden dimension approach called Palu, a novel KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a low-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU kernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can compress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache quantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing KV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the attention module. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.

**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.

### SpChar: Characterizing the Sparse Puzzle via Decision Trees
**Authors**: Francesco Sgherzi, Marco Siracusa, Ivan Fernandez, Adrià Armejach, Miquel Moretó

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T13:06:36Z

**Summary**: Sparse matrix computation is crucial in various modern applications, including large-scale graph analytics, deep learning, and recommender systems. The performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of the input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of sparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target machine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels, such as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of sparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces SpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation. SpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and input characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics gathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis enables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the optimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural features to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm CPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that affect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest limiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of the memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch misprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we propose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to create a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these optimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up to 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied.

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T12:16:39Z

**Summary**: Applications with irregular data structures, data-dependent control flows and fine-grained data transfers (e.g., real-world graph computations) perform poorly on cache-based systems. We propose the UpDown accelerator that supports fine-grained execution with novel architecture mechanisms - lightweight threading, event-driven scheduling, efficient ultra-short threads, and split-transaction DRAM access with software-controlled synchronization. These hardware primitives support software programmable events, enabling high performance on diverse data structures and algorithms. UpDown also supports scalable performance; hardware replication enables programs to scale up performance. Evaluation results show UpDown's flexibility and scalability enable it to outperform CPUs on graph mining and analytics computations by up to 116-195x geomean speedup and more than 4x speedup over prior accelerators. We show that UpDown generates high memory parallelism (~4.6x over CPU) required for memory intensive graph computations. We present measurements that attribute the performance of UpDown (23x architectural advantage) to its individual architectural mechanisms. Finally, we also analyze the area and power cost of UpDown's mechanisms for software programmability.

### Noise-Tolerant Few-Shot Unsupervised Adapter for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Eman Ali, Muhammad Haris Khan

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T08:39:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

### Robust Federated Learning for Wireless Networks: A Demonstration with   Channel Estimation
**Authors**: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Hans D. Schotten

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T08:19:53Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.

### Can Increasing the Hit Ratio Hurt Cache Throughput? (Long Version)
**Authors**: Ziyue Qiu, Juncheng Yang, Mor Harchol-Balter

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T04:01:25Z

**Summary**: Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Kevin Antony Gomez, Tosiron Adegbija

**Updated**: 2024-07-29T01:43:26Z

**Summary**: In-memory computing promises to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck in computer systems by performing computations directly within the memory. Previous research has suggested using Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) for in-memory computing due to its non-volatility, low leakage power, high density, endurance, and commercial viability. This paper explores hierarchical in-memory computing, where different levels of the memory hierarchy are augmented with processing elements to optimize workload execution. The paper investigates processing in memory (PiM) using non-volatile STT-RAM and processing in cache (PiC) using volatile STT-RAM with relaxed retention, which helps mitigate STT-RAM's write latency and energy overheads. We analyze tradeoffs and overheads associated with data movement for PiC versus write overheads for PiM using STT-RAMs for various workloads. We examine workload characteristics, such as computational intensity and CPU-dependent workloads with limited instruction-level parallelism, and their impact on PiC/PiM tradeoffs. Using these workloads, we evaluate computing in STT-RAM versus SRAM at different cache hierarchy levels and explore the potential of heterogeneous STT-RAM cache architectures with various retention times for PiC and CPU-based computing. Our experiments reveal significant advantages of STT-RAM-based PiC over PiM for specific workloads. Finally, we describe open research problems in hierarchical in-memory computing architectures to further enhance this paradigm.

### CHIME: Energy-Efficient STT-RAM-based Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory   Processing
**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Tosiron Adegbija, Kevin Gomez

**Updated**: 2024-07-29T01:17:54Z

**Summary**: Processing-in-cache (PiC) and Processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures, especially those utilizing bit-line computing, offer promising solutions to mitigate data movement bottlenecks within the memory hierarchy. While previous studies have explored the integration of compute units within individual memory levels, the complexity and potential overheads associated with these designs have often limited their capabilities. This paper introduces a novel PiC/PiM architecture, Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory Processing (CHIME), which strategically incorporates heterogeneous compute units across multiple levels of the memory hierarchy. This design targets the efficient execution of diverse, domain-specific workloads by placing computations closest to the data where it optimizes performance, energy consumption, data movement costs, and area. CHIME employs STT-RAM due to its various advantages in PiC/PiM computing, such as high density, low leakage, and better resiliency to data corruption from activating multiple word lines. We demonstrate that CHIME enhances concurrency and improves compute unit utilization at each level of the memory hierarchy. We present strategies for exploring the design space, grouping, and placing the compute units across the memory hierarchy. Experiments reveal that, compared to the state-of-the-art bit-line computing approaches, CHIME achieves significant speedup and energy savings of 57.95% and 78.23% for various domain-specific workloads, while reducing the overheads associated with single-level compute designs.

### ARC: DVFS-Aware Asymmetric-Retention STT-RAM Caches for Energy-Efficient   Multicore Processors
**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Tosiron Adegbija

**Updated**: 2024-07-28T23:43:59Z

**Summary**: Relaxed retention (or volatile) spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been widely studied as a way to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency overheads. Given a relaxed retention time STT-RAM level one (L1) cache, we analyze the impacts of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) -- a common optimization in modern processors -- on STT-RAM L1 cache design. Our analysis reveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require different retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in most STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention time needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core (ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time heterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We also propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to run an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention time requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the proposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall processor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.

### SCART: Predicting STT-RAM Cache Retention Times Using Machine Learning
**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Kyle Kuan, Tosiron Adegbija

**Updated**: 2024-07-28T22:34:20Z

**Summary**: Prior studies have shown that the retention time of the non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) can be relaxed in order to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency. However, since different applications may require different retention times, STT-RAM retention times must be critically explored to satisfy various applications' needs. This process can be challenging due to exploration overhead, and exacerbated by the fact that STT-RAM caches are emerging and are not readily available for design time exploration. This paper explores using known and easily obtainable statistics (e.g., SRAM statistics) to predict the appropriate STT-RAM retention times, in order to minimize exploration overhead. We propose an STT-RAM Cache Retention Time (SCART) model, which utilizes machine learning to enable design time or runtime prediction of right-provisioned STT-RAM retention times for latency or energy optimization. Experimental results show that, on average, SCART can reduce the latency and energy by 20.34% and 29.12%, respectively, compared to a homogeneous retention time while reducing the exploration overheads by 52.58% compared to prior work.

### Missile: Fine-Grained, Hardware-Level GPU Resource Isolation for   Multi-Tenant DNN Inference
**Authors**: Yongkang Zhang, Haoxuan Yu, Chenxia Han, Cheng Wang, Baotong Lu, Yang Li, Xiaowen Chu, Huaicheng Li

**Updated**: 2024-07-27T08:52:39Z

**Summary**: Colocating high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS) and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) of GPU clusters. Limited by bottlenecks such as VRAM channel conflicts and PCIe bus contentions, existing GPU sharing solutions are unable to avoid resource conflicts among concurrently executing tasks, failing to achieve both low latency for LS tasks and high throughput for BE tasks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Missile, a general GPU sharing solution for multi-tenant DNN inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Missile approximates fine-grained GPU hardware resource isolation between multiple LS and BE DNN tasks at software level. Through comprehensive reverse engineering, Missile first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. It also isolates the PCIe bus and fairly allocates PCIe bandwidth using completely fair scheduler. We evaluate 12 mainstream DNNs with synthetic and real-world workloads on four GPUs. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, Missile reduces tail latency for LS services by up to ~50%, achieves up to 6.1x BE job throughput, and allocates PCIe bus bandwidth to tenants on-demand for optimal performance.

### Faster Image2Video Generation: A Closer Look at CLIP Image Embedding's   Impact on Spatio-Temporal Cross-Attentions
**Authors**: Ashkan Taghipour, Morteza Ghahremani, Mohammed Bennamoun, Aref Miri Rekavandi, Zinuo Li, Hamid Laga, Farid Boussaid

**Updated**: 2024-07-27T08:21:14Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation quality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.

### MetaHive: A Cache-Optimized Metadata Management for Heterogeneous   Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Alireza Heidari, Amirhossein Ahmadi, Zefeng Zhi, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-07-26T21:11:58Z

**Summary**: Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV stores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying hardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially running a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is accompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we introduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in heterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from its associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining their interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the downstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also ensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each other in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the caching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval. We deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its rapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.

### Efficient Inference of Vision Instruction-Following Models with Elastic   Cache
**Authors**: Zuyan Liu, Benlin Liu, Jiahui Wang, Yuhao Dong, Guangyi Chen, Yongming Rao, Ranjay Krishna, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T15:29:05Z

**Summary**: In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/liuzuyan/ElasticCache

### KIVI: A Tuning-Free Asymmetric 2bit Quantization for KV Cache
**Authors**: Zirui Liu, Jiayi Yuan, Hongye Jin, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, Vladimir Braverman, Beidi Chen, Xia Hu

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T09:16:05Z

**Summary**: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching of many requests to reduce the cost per request. Yet, with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. Additionally, the loading of the KV cache causes the computational core to be idle, which limits the inference speed. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm named KIVI. With hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama, Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory (including model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload. The source code is available at https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI.

### An Efficient Inference Framework for Early-exit Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ruijie Miao, Yihan Yan, Xinshuo Yao, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T07:50:17Z

**Summary**: Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.

### Robust, Secure and Private Cache-aided Scalar Linear Function Retrieval   from Distributed System with Blind and Adversarial Servers
**Authors**: Qifa Yan, Xiaohu Tang, Zhengchun Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-07-24T13:36:03Z

**Summary**: In this work, a distributed server system composed of multiple servers that holds some coded files and multiple users that are interested in retrieving the linear functions of the files is investigated, where the servers are robust, blind and adversarial in the sense that any $J$ servers can together recover all files, while any $I$ colluding servers cannot obtain any information about the files, and at most $A$ servers maliciously provides erroneous information. In addition, the file library must be secure from a wiretapper who obtains all the signals, and the demands of any subset of users must kept private from the other users and servers, even if they collude. A coding scheme is proposed by incorporating the ideas of Shamir's secret sharing and key superposition into the framework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to characterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or privacy constraints. It is shown that PDAs associated to Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme results in an achievable memory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and communication load were optimal to within a multiplicative gap, except for the small memory regime when the number of files was smaller than the number of users.

### Adaptive Splitting of Reusable Temporal Monitors for Rare Traffic   Violations
**Authors**: Craig Innes, Subramanian Ramamoorthy

**Updated**: 2024-07-24T12:56:41Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.

### Efficient Tuning and Inference for Large Language Models on Textual   Graphs
**Authors**: Yun Zhu, Yaoke Wang, Haizhou Shi, Siliang Tang

**Updated**: 2024-07-24T08:56:11Z

**Summary**: Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

### Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference
**Authors**: Piotr Nawrot, Adrian Łańcucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, Edoardo M. Ponti

**Updated**: 2024-07-23T17:55:30Z

**Summary**: Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.

 ### SYNTHEVAL: Hybrid Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Synthetic   CheckLists
**Authors**: Raoyuan Zhao, Abdullatif Köksal, Yihong Liu, Leonie Weissweiler, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T17:41:30Z

**Summary**: Traditional benchmarking in NLP typically involves using static held-out test sets. However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench (Kiela et al., 2021) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multistep human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires much human labor, often at prohibitive cost. In this work, we propose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models. In the last stage, human experts investigate the challenging examples, manually design templates, and identify the types of failures the taskspecific models consistently exhibit. We apply SYNTHEVAL to two classification tasks, sentiment analysis and toxic language detection, and show that our framework is effective in identifying weaknesses of strong models on these tasks. We share our code in https://github.com/Loreley99/SynthEval_CheckList.

**Authors**: Mohan Shi, Zengrui Jin, Yaoxun Xu, Yong Xu, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Kun Wei, Yiwen Shao, Chunlei Zhang, Dong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T17:29:25Z

**Summary**: Recognizing overlapping speech from multiple speakers in conversational scenarios is one of the most challenging problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Serialized output training (SOT) is a classic method to address multi-talker ASR, with the idea of concatenating transcriptions from multiple speakers according to the emission times of their speech for training. However, SOT-style transcriptions, derived from concatenating multiple related utterances in a conversation, depend significantly on modeling long contexts. Therefore, compared to traditional methods that primarily emphasize encoder performance in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architectures, a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained decoders may be better suited for such complex and challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based SOT approach for multi-talker ASR, leveraging pre-trained speech encoder and LLM, fine-tuning them on multi-talker dataset using appropriate strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional AED-based methods on the simulated dataset LibriMix and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation set of the real-world dataset AMI, outperforming the AED model trained with 1000 times more supervised data in previous works.

### Evaluating Named Entity Recognition: A comparative analysis of mono- and   multilingual transformer models on a novel Brazilian corporate earnings call   transcripts dataset
**Authors**: Ramon Abilio, Guilherme Palermo Coelho, Ana Estela Antunes da Silva

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T17:02:11Z

**Summary**: Since 2018, when the Transformer architecture was introduced, Natural Language Processing has gained significant momentum with pre-trained Transformer-based models that can be fine-tuned for various tasks. Most models are pre-trained on large English corpora, making them less applicable to other languages, such as Brazilian Portuguese. In our research, we identified two models pre-trained in Brazilian Portuguese (BERTimbau and PTT5) and two multilingual models (mBERT and mT5). BERTimbau and mBERT use only the Encoder module, while PTT5 and mT5 use both the Encoder and Decoder. Our study aimed to evaluate their performance on a financial Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and determine the computational requirements for fine-tuning and inference. To this end, we developed the Brazilian Financial NER (BraFiNER) dataset, comprising sentences from Brazilian banks' earnings calls transcripts annotated using a weakly supervised approach. Additionally, we introduced a novel approach that reframes the token classification task as a text generation problem. After fine-tuning the models, we evaluated them using performance and error metrics. Our findings reveal that BERT-based models consistently outperform T5-based models. While the multilingual models exhibit comparable macro F1-scores, BERTimbau demonstrates superior performance over PTT5. In terms of error metrics, BERTimbau outperforms the other models. We also observed that PTT5 and mT5 generated sentences with changes in monetary and percentage values, highlighting the importance of accuracy and consistency in the financial domain. Our findings provide insights into the differing performance of BERT- and T5-based models for the NER task.

**Authors**: Roberto Vila, Helton Saulo, Leonardo Santos, João Monteiros, Felipe Quintino

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:57:42Z

**Summary**: In this paper we propose a family of multivariate asymmetric distributions over an arbitrary subset of set of real numbers which is defined in terms of the well-known elliptically symmetric distributions. We explore essential properties, including the characterization of the density function for various distribution types, as well as other key aspects such as identifiability, quantiles, stochastic representation, conditional and marginal distributions, moments, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and parameter estimation. A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed for examining the performance of the developed parameter estimation method. Finally, the proposed models are used to analyze socioeconomic data.

### Getting Inspiration for Feature Elicitation: App Store- vs. LLM-based   Approach
**Authors**: Jialiang Wei, Anne-Lise Courbis, Thomas Lambolais, Binbin Xu, Pierre Louis Bernard, Gérard Dray, Walid Maalej

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:42:26Z

**Summary**: Over the past decade, app store (AppStore)-inspired requirements elicitation has proven to be highly beneficial. Developers often explore competitors' apps to gather inspiration for new features. With the advance of Generative AI, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of large language model (LLM)-inspired requirements elicitation. LLMs can assist in this process by providing inspiration for new feature ideas. While both approaches are gaining popularity in practice, there is a lack of insight into their differences. We report on a comparative study between AppStore- and LLM-based approaches for refining features into sub-features. By manually analyzing 1,200 sub-features recommended from both approaches, we identified their benefits, challenges, and key differences. While both approaches recommend highly relevant sub-features with clear descriptions, LLMs seem more powerful particularly concerning novel unseen app scopes. Moreover, some recommended features are imaginary with unclear feasibility, which suggests the importance of a human-analyst in the elicitation loop.

### Exploring Group and Symmetry Principles in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shima Imani, Hamid Palangi

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:42:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of applications; however, assessing their reasoning capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a framework grounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in fields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their capabilities. While the proposed framework is general, to showcase the benefits of employing these properties, we focus on arithmetic reasoning and investigate the performance of these models on four group properties: closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. Our findings reveal that LLMs studied in this work struggle to preserve group properties across different test regimes. In the closure test, we observe biases towards specific outputs and an abrupt degradation in their performance from 100% to 0% after a specific sequence length. They also perform poorly in the identity test, which represents adding irrelevant information in the context, and show sensitivity when subjected to inverse test, which examines the robustness of the model with respect to negation. In addition, we demonstrate that breaking down problems into smaller steps helps LLMs in the associativity test that we have conducted. To support these tests we have developed a synthetic dataset which will be released.

### End-to-End Learning for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications Over MIMO   Channels: An Information-Theoretic Framework
**Authors**: Chang Cai, Xiaojun Yuan, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:30:03Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of end-to-end (E2E) design of learning and communication in a task-oriented semantic communication system. In particular, we consider a multi-device cooperative edge inference system over a wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel, where multiple devices transmit extracted features to a server to perform a classification task. We formulate the E2E design of feature encoding, MIMO precoding, and classification as a conditional mutual information maximization problem. However, it is notoriously difficult to design and train an E2E network that can be adaptive to both the task dataset and different channel realizations. Regarding network training, we propose a decoupled pretraining framework that separately trains the feature encoder and the MIMO precoder, with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifier employed at the server to generate the inference result. The feature encoder is pretrained exclusively using the task dataset, while the MIMO precoder is pretrained solely based on the channel and noise distributions. Nevertheless, we manage to align the pretraining objectives of each individual component with the E2E learning objective, so as to approach the performance bound of E2E learning. By leveraging the decoupled pretraining results for initialization, the E2E learning can be conducted with minimal training overhead. Regarding network architecture design, we develop two deep unfolded precoding networks that effectively incorporate the domain knowledge of the solution to the decoupled precoding problem. Simulation results on both the CIFAR-10 and ModelNet10 datasets verify that the proposed method achieves significantly higher classification accuracy compared to various baselines.

### Question-Based Retrieval using Atomic Units for Enterprise RAG
**Authors**: Vatsal Raina, Mark Gales

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:23:13Z

**Summary**: Enterprise retrieval augmented generation (RAG) offers a highly flexible framework for combining powerful large language models (LLMs) with internal, possibly temporally changing, documents. In RAG, documents are first chunked. Relevant chunks are then retrieved for a user query, which are passed as context to a synthesizer LLM to generate the query response. However, the retrieval step can limit performance, as incorrect chunks can lead the synthesizer LLM to generate a false response. This work applies a zero-shot adaptation of standard dense retrieval steps for more accurate chunk recall. Specifically, a chunk is first decomposed into atomic statements. A set of synthetic questions are then generated on these atoms (with the chunk as the context). Dense retrieval involves finding the closest set of synthetic questions, and associated chunks, to the user query. It is found that retrieval with the atoms leads to higher recall than retrieval with chunks. Further performance gain is observed with retrieval using the synthetic questions generated over the atoms. Higher recall at the retrieval step enables higher performance of the enterprise LLM using the RAG pipeline.

### NDP: Next Distribution Prediction as a More Broad Target
**Authors**: Junhao Ruan, Abudukeyumu Abudula, Xinyu Liu, Bei Li, Yinqiao Li, Chenglong Wang, Yuchun Fan, Yuan Ge, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:13:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained on next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm have demonstrated powerful capabilities. However, the existing NTP paradigm contains several limitations, particularly related to planned task complications and error propagation during inference. In our work, we extend the critique of NTP, highlighting its limitation also due to training with a narrow objective: the prediction of a sub-optimal one-hot distribution. To support this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output distribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By evaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot distribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more closely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we introduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$-gram distributions to replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online training time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task, language transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can achieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average improvement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the medical domain. This demonstrates the concrete benefits of addressing the target narrowing problem, pointing to a new direction for future work on improving NTP.

### Overcoming the Coherence Time Barrier in Quantum Machine Learning on   Temporal Data
**Authors**: Fangjun Hu, Saeed A. Khan, Nicholas T. Bronn, Gerasimos Angelatos, Graham E. Rowlands, Guilhem J. Ribeill, Hakan E. Türeci

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:08:26Z

**Summary**: Practical implementation of many quantum algorithms known today is limited by the coherence time of the executing quantum hardware and quantum sampling noise. Here we present a machine learning algorithm, NISQRC, for qubit-based quantum systems that enables inference on temporal data over durations unconstrained by decoherence. NISQRC leverages mid-circuit measurements and deterministic reset operations to reduce circuit executions, while still maintaining an appropriate length persistent temporal memory in quantum system, confirmed through the proposed Volterra Series analysis. This enables NISQRC to overcome not only limitations imposed by finite coherence, but also information scrambling in monitored circuits and sampling noise, problems that persist even in hypothetical fault-tolerant quantum computers that have yet to be realized. To validate our approach, we consider the channel equalization task to recover test signal symbols that are subject to a distorting channel. Through simulations and experiments on a 7-qubit quantum processor we demonstrate that NISQRC can recover arbitrarily long test signals, not limited by coherence time.

### Leveraging Graph Neural Networks to Forecast Electricity Consumption
**Authors**: Eloi Campagne, Yvenn Amara-Ouali, Yannig Goude, Argyris Kalogeratos

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:54:50Z

**Summary**: Accurate electricity demand forecasting is essential for several reasons, especially as the integration of renewable energy sources and the transition to a decentralized network paradigm introduce greater complexity and uncertainty. The proposed methodology leverages graph-based representations to effectively capture the spatial distribution and relational intricacies inherent in this decentralized network structure. This research work offers a novel approach that extends beyond the conventional Generalized Additive Model framework by considering models like Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph SAGE. These graph-based models enable the incorporation of various levels of interconnectedness and information sharing among nodes, where each node corresponds to the combined load (i.e. consumption) of a subset of consumers (e.g. the regions of a country). More specifically, we introduce a range of methods for inferring graphs tailored to consumption forecasting, along with a framework for evaluating the developed models in terms of both performance and explainability. We conduct experiments on electricity forecasting, in both a synthetic and a real framework considering the French mainland regions, and the performance and merits of our approach are discussed.

### Assessing Generative Language Models in Classification Tasks:   Performance and Self-Evaluation Capabilities in the Environmental and Climate   Change Domain
**Authors**: Francesca Grasso, Stefano Locci

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:52:41Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3.5 and Llama2 and one Small Language Model (SLM) Gemma, across three different classification tasks within the climate change (CC) and environmental domain. Employing BERT-based models as a baseline, we compare their efficacy against these transformer-based models. Additionally, we assess the models' self-evaluation capabilities by analyzing the calibration of verbalized confidence scores in these text classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while BERT-based models generally outperform both the LLMs and SLM, the performance of the large generative models is still noteworthy. Furthermore, our calibration analysis reveals that although Gemma is well-calibrated in initial tasks, it thereafter produces inconsistent results; Llama is reasonably calibrated, and GPT consistently exhibits strong calibration. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the utility and effectiveness of generative LMs in addressing some of the planet's most urgent issues, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of ecology and CC.

### Evolving Virtual World with Delta-Engine
**Authors**: Hongqiu Wu, Zekai Xu, Tianyang Xu, Shize Wei, Yan Wang, Jiale Hong, Weiqi Wu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang, Zhezhi He

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T15:08:32Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the \emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace where people can live in. An ideal virtual world shares great similarity with our real world. One of the crucial aspects is its evolving nature, reflected by individuals' capability to grow and thereby influence the objective world. Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems. For this, we propose a special engine called \textbf{\emph{Delta-Engine}} to drive this virtual world. $\Delta$ associates the world's evolution to the engine's scalability. It consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the virtual world; given a trigger, the neural proxy generates new snippets on the base engine through \emph{incremental prediction}. This paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to unknown elements within the world, Technically, it derives from the prefect co-work of the neural proxy and the base engine, and the alignment with high-quality data. We introduce an engine-oriented fine-tuning method that embeds the base engine into the proxy. We then discuss the human-LLM collaborative design to produce novel and interesting data efficiently. Eventually, we propose three evaluation principles to comprehensively assess the performance of a delta engine: naive evaluation, incremental evaluation, and adversarial evaluation.

### Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop   Resampling
**Authors**: Yuejiang Liu, Jubayer Ibn Hamid, Annie Xie, Yoonho Lee, Maximilian Du, Chelsea Finn

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:39:34Z

**Summary**: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. However, its effects on learned policies remain puzzling: some studies highlight its importance for achieving strong performance, while others observe detrimental effects. In this paper, we first dissect the role of action chunking by analyzing the divergence between the learner and the demonstrator. We find that longer action chunks enable a policy to better capture temporal dependencies by taking into account more past states and actions within the chunk. However, this advantage comes at the cost of exacerbating errors in stochastic environments due to fewer observations of recent states. To address this, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples aligned with previous decisions, (ii) forward contrast, which favors samples close to outputs of a stronger policy and distant from those of a weaker policy. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID enhances temporal consistency over extended sequences while enabling adaptive replanning in stochastic environments. Experimental results show that BID substantially outperforms conventional closed-loop operations of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks.

### Forget to Flourish: Leveraging Machine-Unlearning on Pretrained Language   Models for Privacy Leakage
**Authors**: Md Rafi Ur Rashid, Jing Liu, Toshiaki Koike-Akino, Shagufta Mehnaz, Ye Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:35:09Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models on private data for downstream applications poses significant privacy risks in potentially exposing sensitive information. Several popular community platforms now offer convenient distribution of a large variety of pre-trained models, allowing anyone to publish without rigorous verification. This scenario creates a privacy threat, as pre-trained models can be intentionally crafted to compromise the privacy of fine-tuning datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel poisoning technique that uses model-unlearning as an attack tool. This approach manipulates a pre-trained language model to increase the leakage of private data during the fine-tuning process. Our method enhances both membership inference and data extraction attacks while preserving model utility. Experimental results across different models, datasets, and fine-tuning setups demonstrate that our attacks significantly surpass baseline performance. This work serves as a cautionary note for users who download pre-trained models from unverified sources, highlighting the potential risks involved.

**Authors**: Ahmed Mustafa, Muhammad Tahir Rafique, Muhammad Ijlal Baig, Hasan Sajid, Muhammad Jawad Khan, Karam Dad Kallu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:29:08Z

**Summary**: This research paper introduces a novel word-level Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model specifically designed for digital Urdu text, leveraging transformer-based architectures and attention mechanisms to address the distinct challenges of Urdu script recognition, including its diverse text styles, fonts, and variations. The model employs a permuted autoregressive sequence (PARSeq) architecture, which enhances its performance by enabling context-aware inference and iterative refinement through the training of multiple token permutations. This method allows the model to adeptly manage character reordering and overlapping characters, commonly encountered in Urdu script. Trained on a dataset comprising approximately 160,000 Urdu text images, the model demonstrates a high level of accuracy in capturing the intricacies of Urdu script, achieving a CER of 0.178. Despite ongoing challenges in handling certain text variations, the model exhibits superior accuracy and effectiveness in practical applications. Future work will focus on refining the model through advanced data augmentation techniques and the integration of context-aware language models to further enhance its performance and robustness in Urdu text recognition.

### LightFF: Lightweight Inference for Forward-Forward Algorithm
**Authors**: Amin Aminifar, Baichuan Huang, Azra Abtahi, Amir Aminifar

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:17:11Z

**Summary**: The human brain performs tasks with an outstanding energy efficiency, i.e., with approximately 20 Watts. The state-of-the-art Artificial/Deep Neural Networks (ANN/DNN), on the other hand, have recently been shown to consume massive amounts of energy. The training of these ANNs/DNNs is done almost exclusively based on the back-propagation algorithm, which is known to be biologically implausible. This has led to a new generation of forward-only techniques, including the Forward-Forward algorithm. In this paper, we propose a lightweight inference scheme specifically designed for DNNs trained using the Forward-Forward algorithm. We have evaluated our proposed lightweight inference scheme in the case of the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, as well as two real-world applications, namely, epileptic seizure detection and cardiac arrhythmia classification using wearable technologies, where complexity overheads/energy consumption is a major constraint, and demonstrate its relevance. Our code is available at https://github.com/AminAminifar/LightFF.

### DeformGS: Scene Flow in Highly Deformable Scenes for Deformable Object   Manipulation
**Authors**: Bardienus P. Duisterhof, Zhao Mandi, Yunchao Yao, Jia-Wei Liu, Jenny Seidenschwarz, Mike Zheng Shou, Deva Ramanan, Shuran Song, Stan Birchfield, Bowen Wen, Jeffrey Ichnowski

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:16:43Z

**Summary**: Teaching robots to fold, drape, or reposition deformable objects such as cloth will unlock a variety of automation applications. While remarkable progress has been made for rigid object manipulation, manipulating deformable objects poses unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, infinite-dimensional state spaces and complex dynamics. Just as object pose estimation and tracking have aided robots for rigid manipulation, dense 3D tracking (scene flow) of highly deformable objects will enable new applications in robotics while aiding existing approaches, such as imitation learning or creating digital twins with real2sim transfer. We propose DeformGS, an approach to recover scene flow in highly deformable scenes, using simultaneous video captures of a dynamic scene from multiple cameras. DeformGS builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel-view synthesis. DeformGS learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with canonical properties into world space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on conservation of momentum and isometry, which leads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. We also leverage existing foundation models SAM and XMEM to produce noisy masks, and learn a per-Gaussian mask for better physics-inspired regularization. DeformGS achieves high-quality 3D tracking on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. In experiments, DeformGS improves 3D tracking by an average of 55.8% compared to the state-of-the-art. With sufficient texture, DeformGS achieves a median tracking error of 3.3 mm on a cloth of 1.5 x 1.5 m in area. Website: https://deformgs.github.io

### Not All Videos Become Outdated: Short-Video Recommendation by Learning   to Deconfound Release Interval Bias
**Authors**: Lulu Dong, Guoxiu He, Aixin Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:48:52Z

**Summary**: Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently released videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user's attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users' attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI.

### Language models align with human judgments on key grammatical   constructions
**Authors**: Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald, Gary Lupyan, Anna Ivanova, Roger Levy

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:43:22Z

**Summary**: Do large language models (LLMs) make human-like linguistic generalizations? Dentella et al. (2023) ("DGL") prompt several LLMs ("Is the following sentence grammatically correct in English?") to elicit grammaticality judgments of 80 English sentences, concluding that LLMs demonstrate a "yes-response bias" and a "failure to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences". We re-evaluate LLM performance using well-established practices and find that DGL's data in fact provide evidence for just how well LLMs capture human behaviors. Models not only achieve high accuracy overall, but also capture fine-grained variation in human linguistic judgments.

### Estimation of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Diagnosis from Electrocardiogram   Features
**Authors**: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Nils Strodthoff

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:42:03Z

**Summary**: Introduction: Ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis of medical conditions is paramount for effective patient care. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are fundamental for evaluating a patient's cardiac health and are readily available. Despite this, little attention has been given to the remarkable potential of ECG data in detecting non-cardiac conditions.   Methods: In our study, we used publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD and ECG-VIEW II) to investigate the feasibility of inferring general diagnostic conditions from ECG features. To this end, we trained a tree-based model (XGBoost) based on ECG features and basic demographic features to estimate a wide range of diagnoses, encompassing both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.   Results: Our results demonstrate the reliability of estimating 23 cardiac as well as 21 non-cardiac conditions above 0.7 AUROC in a statistically significant manner across a wide range of physiological categories. Our findings underscore the predictive potential of ECG data in identifying well-known cardiac conditions. However, even more striking, this research represents a pioneering effort in systematically expanding the scope of ECG-based diagnosis to conditions not traditionally associated with the cardiac system.

### Parameters Inference for Nonlinear Wave Equations with Markovian   Switching
**Authors**: Yi Zhang, Zhikun Zhang, Xiangjun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:39:24Z

**Summary**: Traditional partial differential equations with constant coefficients often struggle to capture abrupt changes in real-world phenomena, leading to the development of variable coefficient PDEs and Markovian switching models. Recently, research has introduced the concept of PDEs with Markov switching models, established their well-posedness and presented numerical methods. However, there has been limited discussion on parameter estimation for the jump coefficients in these models. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on parameter inference for the wave equation with Markovian switching. We propose a Bayesian statistical framework using discrete sparse Bayesian learning to establish its convergence and a uniform error bound. Our method requires fewer assumptions and enables independent parameter inference for each segment by allowing different underlying structures for the parameter estimation problem within each segmented time interval. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through three numerical cases, which involve noisy spatiotemporal data from different wave equations with Markovian switching. The results show strong performance in parameter estimation for variable coefficient PDEs.

### Bridging Domain Knowledge and Process Discovery Using Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Ali Norouzifar, Humam Kourani, Marcus Dees, Wil van der Aalst

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:23:40Z

**Summary**: Discovering good process models is essential for different process analysis tasks such as conformance checking and process improvements. Automated process discovery methods often overlook valuable domain knowledge. This knowledge, including insights from domain experts and detailed process documentation, remains largely untapped during process discovery. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate such knowledge directly into process discovery. We use rules derived from LLMs to guide model construction, ensuring alignment with both domain knowledge and actual process executions. By integrating LLMs, we create a bridge between process knowledge expressed in natural language and the discovery of robust process models, advancing process discovery methodologies significantly. To showcase the usability of our framework, we conducted a case study with the UWV employee insurance agency, demonstrating its practical benefits and effectiveness.

### Reducing the error rate of a superconducting logical qubit using analog   readout information
**Authors**: Hany Ali, Jorge Marques, Ophelia Crawford, Joonas Majaniemi, Marc Serra-Peralta, David Byfield, Boris Varbanov, Barbara M. Terhal, Leonardo DiCarlo, Earl T. Campbell

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:19:46Z

**Summary**: Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional error decoding approaches, relying on the binarization (`hardening') of readout data, often ignore valuable information embedded in the analog (`soft') readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-three ($d=3$) bit-flip surface code with transmons. To this end, we use the $3\times3$ data-qubit array to encode each of the $16$ computational states that make up the logical state $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$, and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated $Z$-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$ state, we average across the $16$ computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to $6.8\%$ in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could reduce the readout duration, further minimizing logical error rates.

### Automatic Library Migration Using Large Language Models: First Results
**Authors**: Aylton Almeida, Laerte Xavier, Marco Tulio Valente

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:17:46Z

**Summary**: Despite being introduced only a few years ago, Large Language Models (LLMs) are already widely used by developers for code generation. However, their application in automating other Software Engineering activities remains largely unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we report the first results of a study in which we are exploring the use of ChatGPT to support API migration tasks, an important problem that demands manual effort and attention from developers. Specifically, in the paper, we share our initial results involving the use of ChatGPT to migrate a client application to use a newer version of SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library widely used in Python. We evaluate the use of three types of prompts (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Chain Of Thoughts) and show that the best results are achieved by the One-Shot prompt, followed by the Chain Of Thoughts. Particularly, with the One-Shot prompt we were able to successfully migrate all columns of our target application and upgrade its code to use new functionalities enabled by SQLAlchemy's latest version, such as Python's asyncio and typing modules, while preserving the original code behavior.

### Accelerating the discovery of steady-states of planetary interior   dynamics with machine learning
**Authors**: Siddhant Agarwal, Nicola Tosi, Christian Hüttig, David S. Greenberg, Ali Can Bekar

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:55:19Z

**Summary**: Simulating mantle convection often requires reaching a computationally expensive steady-state, crucial for deriving scaling laws for thermal and dynamical flow properties and benchmarking numerical solutions. The strong temperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity variations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant lid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly convecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with constant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the time step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently, achieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the disparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.   We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using machine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with mixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict steady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize numerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared to typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach steady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method lies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with no prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal computational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations for advancing mantle convection research.

### Minor DPO reject penalty to increase training robustness
**Authors**: Shiming Xie, Hong Chen, Fred Yu, Zeye Sun, Xiuyu Wu, Yingfan Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:54:36Z

**Summary**: Learning from human preference is a paradigm used in large-scale language model (LLM) fine-tuning step to better align pretrained LLM to human preference for downstream task. In the past it uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to optimize the LLM policy to align with these preferences and not to draft too far from the original model. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed to solve the alignment problem with a simplified RL-free method. Using preference pairs of chosen and reject data, DPO models the relative log probability as implicit reward function and optimize LLM policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective directly. DPO is quite straight forward and easy to be understood. It perform efficiently and well in most cases. In this article, we analyze the working mechanism of $\beta$ in DPO, disclose its syntax difference between RL algorithm and DPO, and understand the potential shortage brought by the DPO simplification. With these insights, we propose MinorDPO, which is better aligned to the original RL algorithm, and increase the stability of preference optimization process.

### Diversifying the Mixture-of-Experts Representation for Language Models   with Orthogonal Optimizer
**Authors**: Boan Liu, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Keqin Peng, Yu Cao, Dazhao Cheng, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:39:56Z

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a highly successful technique in deep learning, based on the principle of divide-and-conquer to maximize model capacity without significant additional computational cost. Even in the era of large-scale language models (LLMs), MoE continues to play a crucial role, as some researchers have indicated that GPT-4 adopts the MoE structure to ensure diverse inference results. However, MoE is susceptible to performance degeneracy, particularly evident in the issues of imbalance and homogeneous representation among experts. While previous studies have extensively addressed the problem of imbalance, the challenge of homogeneous representation remains unresolved. In this study, we shed light on the homogeneous representation problem, wherein experts in the MoE fail to specialize and lack diversity, leading to frustratingly high similarities in their representations (up to 99\% in a well-performed MoE model). This problem restricts the expressive power of the MoE and, we argue, contradicts its original intention. To tackle this issue, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective solution: OMoE, an orthogonal expert optimizer. Additionally, we introduce an alternating training strategy that encourages each expert to update in a direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by other experts. Our algorithm facilitates MoE training in two key ways: firstly, it explicitly enhances representation diversity, and secondly, it implicitly fosters interaction between experts during orthogonal weights computation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed optimization algorithm significantly improves the performance of fine-tuning the MoE model on the GLUE benchmark, SuperGLUE benchmark, question-answering task, and name entity recognition tasks.

### Minimax and Communication-Efficient Distributed Best Subset Selection   with Oracle Property
**Authors**: Jingguo Lan, Hongmei Lin, Xueqin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:22:08Z

**Summary**: The explosion of large-scale data in fields such as finance, e-commerce, and social media has outstripped the processing capabilities of single-machine systems, driving the need for distributed statistical inference methods. Traditional approaches to distributed inference often struggle with achieving true sparsity in high-dimensional datasets and involve high computational costs. We propose a novel, two-stage, distributed best subset selection algorithm to address these issues. Our approach starts by efficiently estimating the active set while adhering to the $\ell_0$ norm-constrained surrogate likelihood function, effectively reducing dimensionality and isolating key variables. A refined estimation within the active set follows, ensuring sparse estimates and matching the minimax $\ell_2$ error bound. We introduce a new splicing technique for adaptive parameter selection to tackle subproblems under $\ell_0$ constraints and a Generalized Information Criterion (GIC). Our theoretical and numerical studies show that the proposed algorithm correctly finds the true sparsity pattern, has the oracle property, and greatly lowers communication costs. This is a big step forward in distributed sparse estimation.

### Effect of the spatial curvature on light bending and time delay in   curved Einstein-Straus--de Sitter spacetime
**Authors**: Mourad Guenouche

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:04:30Z

**Summary**: A method of general applicability has been developed, whereby the null geodesic equations of the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter metric can be integrated simultaneously in terms of the curvature constant $k$. The purpose is to generalize the computation of light deflection and time delay by a spherical mass distribution. Assuming a flat Universe with most recent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, five time delays between the four bright images of the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 have been forecasted and compared to others in the field. In addition, we have reviewed the question of the possible contribution of a positive $\Lambda$ to reduce the light bending, and concluded that the changes are seemingly too small to be appreciable on cosmological scales. The same conclusion has been reached regarding the time delay. Having addressed the question of the effect of the spatial curvature in both closed and open Universe, we have found that the strong lensing is slightly affected by the expected small curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$ of the current Universe within its error bar $|\Omega_{k0}|\lessapprox 0.001$, in such a way that it may safely be neglected. However, it's only if $\Omega_{k0}$ gets quite larger that the effect being noticeable. While it is only theoretically possible for $\Omega_{k0}$ to be higher, it's worthwhile to stress that this should impact the light bending and time delay, causing them to decrease or increase depending upon whether the spatial curvature is positive or negative. Furthermore, one can infer that the observed light deflection and time delay independently, that are found to be significantly deviated from those of the flat Universe, may serve as a useful means to provide constraints on $\Omega _{k0}$, thus making the approach employed in this work more promising than others.

### Likelihood estimation for stochastic differential equations with mixed   effects
**Authors**: Fernando Baltazar-Larios, Mogens Bladt, Michael Sørensen

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:56:16Z

**Summary**: Stochastic differential equations provide a powerful and versatile tool for modelling dynamic phenomena affected by random noise. In case of repeated observations of time series for several experimental units, it is often the case that some of the parameters vary between the individual experimental units, which has motivated a considerable interest in stochastic differential equations with mixed effects, where a subset of the parameters are random. These models enables simultaneous representation of randomness in the dynamics and variability between experimental units. When the data are observations at discrete time points, the likelihood function is only rarely explicitly available, so for likelihood based inference numerical methods are needed. We present Gibbs samplers and stochastic EM-algorithms based on the simple methods for simulation of diffusion bridges in Bladt and S{\o}rensen (2014). These methods are easy to implement and have no tuning parameters. They are, moreover, computationally efficient at low sampling frequencies because the computing time increases linearly with the time between observations. The algorithms are shown to simplify considerably for exponential families of diffusion processes. In a simulation study, the estimation methods are shown to work well for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and t-diffusions with mixed effects. Finally, the Gibbs sampler is applied to neuronal data.

### VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time   Series Forecasters
**Authors**: Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:51:55Z

**Summary**: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF.

### Abstracted Gaussian Prototypes for One-Shot Concept Learning
**Authors**: Chelsea Zou, Kenneth J. Kurtz

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:50:15Z

**Summary**: We introduce a cluster-based generative image segmentation framework to encode higher-level representations of visual concepts based on one-shot learning inspired by the Omniglot Challenge. The inferred parameters of each component of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) represent a distinct topological subpart of a visual concept. Sampling new data from these parameters generates augmented subparts to build a more robust prototype for each concept, i.e., the Abstracted Gaussian Prototype (AGP). This framework addresses one-shot classification tasks using a cognitively-inspired similarity metric and addresses one-shot generative tasks through a novel AGP-VAE pipeline employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate new class variants. Results from human judges reveal that the generative pipeline produces novel examples and classes of visual concepts that are broadly indistinguishable from those made by humans. The proposed framework leads to impressive but not state-of-the-art classification accuracy; thus, the contribution is two-fold: 1) the system is uniquely low in theoretical and computational complexity and operates in a completely standalone manner compared while existing approaches draw heavily on pre-training or knowledge engineering; and 2) in contrast with competing neural network models, the AGP approach addresses the importance of breadth of task capability emphasized in the Omniglot challenge (i.e., successful performance on generative tasks). These two points are critical as we advance toward an understanding of how learning/reasoning systems can produce viable, robust, and flexible concepts based on literally nothing more than a single example.

**Authors**: Jian Ma, Yonglin Deng, Chen Chen, Haonan Lu, Zhenyu Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:44:44Z

**Summary**: Posters play a crucial role in marketing and advertising by enhancing visual communication and brand visibility, making significant contributions to industrial design. With the latest advancements in controllable T2I diffusion models, increasing research has focused on rendering text within synthesized images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of automatic poster generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an automatic poster generation framework with text rendering capabilities leveraging LLMs, utilizing a triple-cross attention mechanism based on alignment learning. This framework aims to create precise poster text within a detailed contextual background. Additionally, the framework supports controllable fonts, adjustable image resolution, and the rendering of posters with descriptions and text in both English and Chinese.Furthermore, we introduce a high-resolution font dataset and a poster dataset with resolutions exceeding 1024 pixels. Our approach leverages the SDXL architecture. Extensive experiments validate our method's capability in generating poster images with complex and contextually rich backgrounds.Codes is available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/GlyphDraw2.

### Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey
**Authors**: Sibo Yi, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Jiaxing Song, Ke Xu, Qi Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:57:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.

### The FLAMINGO Project: An assessment of the systematic errors in the   predictions of models for galaxy cluster counts used to infer cosmological   parameters
**Authors**: Roi Kugel, Joop Schaye, Matthieu Schaller, Victor J. Forouhar Moreno, Robert J. McGibbon

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:48:51Z

**Summary**: Galaxy cluster counts have historically been important for the measurement of cosmological parameters and upcoming surveys will greatly reduce the statistical errors. To exploit the potential of current and future cluster surveys, theoretical uncertainties on the predicted abundance must be smaller than the statistical errors. Models used to predict cluster counts typically combine a model for the dark matter only (DMO) halo mass function (HMF) with an observable - mass relation that is assumed to be a power-law with lognormal scatter. We use the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to quantify the biases in the cluster counts and cosmological parameters resulting from the different ingredients of conventional models. For the observable mass proxy we focus on the Compton-Y parameter quantifying the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which is expected to result in cluster samples that are relatively close to mass-selected samples. We construct three mock surveys based on existing (Planck and SPT) and upcoming (Simons Observatory) surveys. We ignore measurement uncertainties and compare the biases in the counts and inferred cosmological parameters to each survey's Poisson errors. We find that widely used models for the DMO HMF differ significantly from each other and from the DMO version of FLAMINGO, leading to significant biases for all three surveys. For upcoming surveys, dramatic improvements are needed for all additional model ingredients, i.e. the functional forms of the fits to the observable-mass scaling relation and the associated scatter, the priors on the scaling relation and the prior on baryonic effects associated with feedback processes on the HMF.

### SynDL: A Large-Scale Synthetic Test Collection for Passage Retrieval
**Authors**: Hossein A. Rahmani, Xi Wang, Emine Yilmaz, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Paul Thomas

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:48:40Z

**Summary**: Large-scale test collections play a crucial role in Information Retrieval (IR) research. However, according to the Cranfield paradigm and the research into publicly available datasets, the existing information retrieval research studies are commonly developed on small-scale datasets that rely on human assessors for relevance judgments - a time-intensive and expensive process. Recent studies have shown the strong capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in producing reliable relevance judgments with human accuracy but at a greatly reduced cost. In this paper, to address the missing large-scale ad-hoc document retrieval dataset, we extend the TREC Deep Learning Track (DL) test collection via additional language model synthetic labels to enable researchers to test and evaluate their search systems at a large scale. Specifically, such a test collection includes more than 1,900 test queries from the previous years of tracks. We compare system evaluation with past human labels from past years and find that our synthetically created large-scale test collection can lead to highly correlated system rankings.

### Expert-Token Resonance: Redefining MoE Routing through Affinity-Driven   Active Selection
**Authors**: Jing Li, Zhijie Sun, Dachao Lin, Xuan He, Yi Lin, Binfan Zheng, Li Zeng, Rongqian Zhao, Xin Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:32:48Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach for large language models (LLMs), offering unprecedented computational efficiency. However, these architectures grapple with challenges of token distribution imbalance and expert homogenization, impeding optimal semantic generalization. We introduce a novel framework that redefines MoE routing through affinity-driven active selection. The innovations for the framework encompass: (1) A rigorous formulation of expert-token affinity metrics. (2) An adaptive bidirectional selection mechanism leveraging resonance between experts and tokens. (3) Theoretical derivation and experimental evidence of reduced expert capacity bounds under dynamic token distribution evolution. It is also integrated with orthogonal feature extraction module and an optimized loss function for expert localization. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach mitigates expert homogenization while enabling substantial capacity boundary reduction. Experimental validation corroborates these findings: it achieves a 40% reduction in token processed by each expert without compromising model convergence or efficacy. When coupled with communication optimizations, the training efficiency improvements of 5.4% to 46.6% can be observed. After supervised fine-tuning, it exhibits performance gains of 9.7% to 14.1% across GDAD, C-Eval, and TeleQnA benchmarks.

### TaSL: Task Skill Localization and Consolidation for Language Model   Continual Learning
**Authors**: Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:14:17Z

**Summary**: Language model continual learning (CL) has recently attracted significant interest for its ability to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world scenarios without retraining. A major challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL framework for language models, named Task Skill Localization and Consolidation (TaSL), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay. TaSL initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter dependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a novel group-wise skill localization technique to ascertain the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves an optimal balance between retaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and adaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable extensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay techniques. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two CL benchmarks, involving models ranging from 220M to 7B parameters, affirm the effectiveness of TaSL and its variants across different settings.

### Estimation and inference of average treatment effects under   heterogeneous additive treatment effect model
**Authors**: Xin Lu, Hongzi Li, Hanzhong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:07:11Z

**Summary**: Randomized experiments are the gold standard for estimating treatment effects, yet network interference challenges the validity of traditional estimators by violating the stable unit treatment value assumption and introducing bias. While cluster randomized experiments mitigate this bias, they encounter limitations in handling network complexity and fail to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. To address these challenges, we develop a design-based asymptotic theory for the existing Horvitz--Thompson estimators of the direct, indirect, and global average treatment effects under Bernoulli trials. We assume the heterogeneous additive treatment effect model with a hidden network that drives interference. Observing that these estimators are inconsistent in dense networks, we introduce novel eigenvector-based regression adjustment estimators to ensure consistency. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators and provide conservative variance estimators under the design-based inference framework, offering robust conclusions independent of the underlying stochastic processes of the network and model parameters. Our method's adaptability is demonstrated across various interference structures, including partial interference and local interference in a two-sided marketplace. Numerical studies further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed estimators, offering practical insights into handling network interference.

### Reasoning with maximal consistent signatures
**Authors**: Matthias Thimm, Jandson Santos Ribeiro Santos

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:43:14Z

**Summary**: We analyse a specific instance of the general approach of reasoning based on forgetting by Lang and Marquis. More precisely, we discuss an approach for reasoning with inconsistent information using maximal consistent subsignatures, where a maximal consistent subsignature is a maximal set of propositions such that forgetting the remaining propositions restores consistency. We analyse maximal consistent subsignatures and the corresponding minimal inconsistent subsignatures in-depth and show, among others, that the hitting set duality applies for them as well. We further analyse inference relations based on maximal consistent subsignatures wrt. rationality postulates from non-monotonic reasoning and computational complexity. We also consider the relationship of our approach with inconsistency measurement and paraconsistent reasoning.

**Authors**: Luca Giamattei, Antonio Guerriero, Roberto Pietrantuono, Stefano Russo

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:34:11Z

**Summary**: Context: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a fundamental part of software engineering to ensure stakeholders that software products work as expected after release in operation. Machine Learning (ML) has proven to be able to boost SQA activities and contribute to the development of quality software systems. In this context, Causal Reasoning is gaining increasing interest as a methodology to solve some of the current ML limitations. It aims to go beyond a purely data-driven approach by exploiting the use of causality for more effective SQA strategies. Objective: Provide a broad and detailed overview of the use of causal reasoning for SQA activities, in order to support researchers to access this research field, identifying room for application, main challenges and research opportunities. Methods: A systematic literature review of causal reasoning in the SQA research area. Scientific papers have been searched, classified, and analyzed according to established guidelines for software engineering secondary studies. Results: Results highlight the primary areas within SQA where causal reasoning has been applied, the predominant methodologies used, and the level of maturity of the proposed solutions. Fault localization is the activity where causal reasoning is more exploited, especially in the web services/microservices domain, but other tasks like testing are rapidly gaining popularity. Both causal inference and causal discovery are exploited, with the Pearl's graphical formulation of causality being preferred, likely due to its intuitiveness. Tools to favour their application are appearing at a fast pace - most of them after 2021. Conclusions: The findings show that causal reasoning is a valuable means for SQA tasks with respect to multiple quality attributes, especially during V&V, evolution and maintenance to ensure reliability, while it is not yet fully exploited for phases like ...

### Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio   Language Model
**Authors**: Zhen Ye, Peiwen Sun, Jiahe Lei, Hongzhan Lin, Xu Tan, Zheqi Dai, Qiuqiang Kong, Jianyi Chen, Jiahao Pan, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:24:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)

### Leveraging Blockchain and ANFIS for Optimal Supply Chain Management
**Authors**: Amirfarhad Farhadi, Homayoun Safarpour Motealegh Mahalegi, Abolfazl Pourrezaeian Firouzabad, Azadeh Zamanifar, Majid Sorouri

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T10:35:57Z

**Summary**: The supply chain is a critical segment of the product manufacturing cycle, continuously influenced by risky, uncertain, and undesirable events. Optimizing flexibility in the supply chain presents a complex, multi-objective, and nonlinear programming challenge. In the poultry supply chain, the development of mass customization capabilities has led manufacturing companies to increasingly focus on offering tailored and customized services for individual products. To safeguard against data tampering and ensure the integrity of setup costs and overall profitability, a multi-signature decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, integrated with the IoT on a blockchain platform, is proposed. Managing the poultry supply chain involves uncertainties that may not account for parameters such as delivery time to retailers, reorder time, and the number of requested products. To address these challenges, this study employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), combining neural networks with fuzzy logic to compensate for the lack of data training in parameter identification. Through MATLAB simulations, the study investigates the average shop delivery duration, the reorder time, and the number of products per order. By implementing the proposed technique, the average delivery time decreases from 40 to 37 minutes, the reorder time decreases from five to four days, and the quantity of items requested per order grows from six to eleven. Additionally, the ANFIS model enhances overall supply chain performance by reducing transaction times by 15\% compared to conventional systems, thereby improving real-time responsiveness and boosting transparency in supply chain operations, effectively resolving operational issues.

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:52:00Z

**Summary**: Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) contribute significantly to the stellar buildup at cosmic noon. Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5. Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar populations and dust distributions on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting. The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs=340-2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2<z<3. They belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk like, with radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit substructures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag extending over several kpc with asymmetric distributions that include off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. Their NIR dust-attenuation curve deviates from standard laws, possibly implying different dust-star geometries or dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, an overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and widespread star formation collectively favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs. The galaxies' large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.

### Scalable Bayesian Clustering for Integrative Analysis of Multi-View Data
**Authors**: Rafael Cabral, Maria de Iorio, Andrew Harris

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:47:40Z

**Summary**: In the era of Big Data, scalable and accurate clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data are essential. We present new Bayesian Distance Clustering (BDC) models and inference algorithms with improved scalability while maintaining the predictive accuracy of modern Bayesian non-parametric models. Unlike traditional methods, BDC models the distance between observations rather than the observations directly, offering a compromise between the scalability of distance-based methods and the enhanced predictive power and probabilistic interpretation of model-based methods. However, existing BDC models still rely on performing inference on the partition model to group observations into clusters. The support of this partition model grows exponentially with the dataset's size, complicating posterior space exploration and leading to many costly likelihood evaluations. Inspired by K-medoids, we propose using tessellations in discrete space to simplify inference by focusing the learning task on finding the best tessellation centers, or "medoids." Additionally, we extend our models to effectively handle multi-view data, such as data comprised of clusters that evolve across time, enhancing their applicability to complex datasets. The real data application in numismatics demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.

### A Markovian dynamics for C. elegans behavior across scales
**Authors**: Antonio C. Costa, Tosif Ahamed, David Jordan, Greg J. Stephens

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:39:19Z

**Summary**: How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C. elegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both "runs-and-pirouettes" as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.

### A Relational Solver for Constraint-based Type Inference
**Authors**: Eridan Domoratskiy, Dmitry Boulytchev

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:27:41Z

**Summary**: We present a miniKanren-based type inferencer for an educational programming language with first-class functions, S-expressions, and pattern-matching. The language itself is untyped which adds a certain specificity to the problem and requires the employment of techniques conventionally used in implicit/gradual typing settings. The presence of polymorphic and recursive types poses a certain challenge when implementing the inferencer in miniKanren and requires a number of tricks, optimizations, and extensions to be used; we report on those as well.

### VQ4DiT: Efficient Post-Training Vector Quantization for Diffusion   Transformers
**Authors**: Juncan Deng, Shuaiting Li, Zeyu Wang, Hong Gu, Kedong Xu, Kejie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:15:54Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Transformers Models (DiTs) have transitioned the network architecture from traditional UNets to transformers, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in image generation. Although DiTs have been widely applied to high-definition video generation tasks, their large parameter size hinders inference on edge devices. Vector quantization (VQ) can decompose model weight into a codebook and assignments, allowing extreme weight quantization and significantly reducing memory usage. In this paper, we propose VQ4DiT, a fast post-training vector quantization method for DiTs. We found that traditional VQ methods calibrate only the codebook without calibrating the assignments. This leads to weight sub-vectors being incorrectly assigned to the same assignment, providing inconsistent gradients to the codebook and resulting in a suboptimal result. To address this challenge, VQ4DiT calculates the candidate assignment set for each weight sub-vector based on Euclidean distance and reconstructs the sub-vector based on the weighted average. Then, using the zero-data and block-wise calibration method, the optimal assignment from the set is efficiently selected while calibrating the codebook. VQ4DiT quantizes a DiT XL/2 model on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within 20 minutes to 5 hours depending on the different quantization settings. Experiments show that VQ4DiT establishes a new state-of-the-art in model size and performance trade-offs, quantizing weights to 2-bit precision while retaining acceptable image generation quality.

### ConCodeEval: Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Constraints in   Domain-Specific Languages
**Authors**: Mehant Kammakomati, Sameer Pimparkhede, Srikanth Tamilselvam, Prince Kumar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:13:50Z

**Summary**: Recent work shows Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand natural language constraints for various text generation tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. While, in the code domain, there is wide usage of constraints in code format to maintain the integrity of code written in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) like JSON and YAML which are widely used for system-level programming tasks in enterprises. Given that LLMs are increasingly used for system-level code tasks, evaluating if they can comprehend these code constraints is crucial. However, no work has been done to evaluate their controllability over code constraints. Hence, we introduce ConCodeEval, a first-of-its-kind benchmark having two novel tasks for code constraints across five representations. Our findings suggest that language models struggle with code constraints. Code languages that perform excellently for normal code tasks do not perform well when the same languages represent fine-grained constraints.

### Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification With Discount Fusion
**Authors**: Haojian Huang, Zhe Liu, Sukumar Letchmunan, Muhammet Deveci, Mingwei Lin, Weizhong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:06:06Z

**Summary**: Incomplete multi-view data classification poses significant challenges due to the common issue of missing views in real-world scenarios. Despite advancements, existing methods often fail to provide reliable predictions, largely due to the uncertainty of missing views and the inconsistent quality of imputed data. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification (EDP-MVC). Initially, we use K-means imputation to address missing views, creating a complete set of multi-view data. However, the potential conflicts and uncertainties within this imputed data can affect the reliability of downstream inferences. To manage this, we introduce a Conflict-Aware Evidential Fusion Network (CAEFN), which dynamically adjusts based on the reliability of the evidence, ensuring trustworthy discount fusion and producing reliable inference outcomes. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets reveal EDP-MVC not only matches but often surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods.

### Characterising rooted and unrooted tree-child networks
**Authors**: Janosch Döcker, Simone Linz

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:44:58Z

**Summary**: Rooted phylogenetic networks are used by biologists to infer and represent complex evolutionary relationships between species that cannot be accurately explained by a phylogenetic tree. Tree-child networks are a particular class of rooted phylogenetic networks that has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we give a novel characterisation of a tree-child network $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of cherry-picking sequences that are sequences on the leaves of $\mathcal{R}$ and reduce it to a single vertex by repeatedly applying one of two reductions to its leaves. We show that our characterisation extends to unrooted tree-child networks which are mostly unexplored in the literature and, in turn, also offers a new approach to settling the computational complexity of deciding if an unrooted phylogenetic network can be oriented as a rooted tree-child network.

### Inference on many jumps in nonparametric panel regression models
**Authors**: Likai Chen, Georg Keilbar, Liangjun Su, Weining Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:42:39Z

**Summary**: We investigate the significance of change-point or jump effects within fully nonparametric regression contexts, with a particular focus on panel data scenarios where data generation processes vary across individual or group units, and error terms may display complex dependency structures. In our setting the threshold effect depends on a specific covariate, and we permit the true nonparametric regression to vary based on additional latent variables. We propose two uniform testing procedures: one to assess the existence of change-point effects and another to evaluate the uniformity of such effects across units. Even though the underlying data generation processes are neither independent nor identically distributed, our approach involves deriving a straightforward analytical expression to approximate the variance-covariance structure of change-point effects under general dependency conditions. Notably, when Gaussian approximations are made to these test statistics, the intricate dependency structures within the data can be safely disregarded owing to the localized nature of the statistics. This finding bears significant implications for obtaining critical values. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our tests exhibit excellent control over size and reasonable power performance in finite samples, irrespective of strong cross-sectional and weak serial dependency within the data. Furthermore, applying our tests to two datasets reveals the existence of significant nonsmooth effects in both cases.

### Understanding the User: An Intent-Based Ranking Dataset
**Authors**: Abhijit Anand, Jurek Leonhardt, V Venktesh, Avishek Anand

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:40:59Z

**Summary**: As information retrieval systems continue to evolve, accurate evaluation and benchmarking of these systems become pivotal. Web search datasets, such as MS MARCO, primarily provide short keyword queries without accompanying intent or descriptions, posing a challenge in comprehending the underlying information need. This paper proposes an approach to augmenting such datasets to annotate informative query descriptions, with a focus on two prominent benchmark datasets: TREC-DL-21 and TREC-DL-22. Our methodology involves utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs to analyze and comprehend the implicit intent within individual queries from benchmark datasets. By extracting key semantic elements, we construct detailed and contextually rich descriptions for these queries. To validate the generated query descriptions, we employ crowdsourcing as a reliable means of obtaining diverse human perspectives on the accuracy and informativeness of the descriptions. This information can be used as an evaluation set for tasks such as ranking, query rewriting, or others.

### UTrack: Multi-Object Tracking with Uncertain Detections
**Authors**: Edgardo Solano-Carrillo, Felix Sattler, Antje Alex, Alexander Klein, Bruno Pereira Costa, Angel Bueno Rodriguez, Jannis Stoppe

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:34:51Z

**Summary**: The tracking-by-detection paradigm is the mainstream in multi-object tracking, associating tracks to the predictions of an object detector. Although exhibiting uncertainty through a confidence score, these predictions do not capture the entire variability of the inference process. For safety and security critical applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, etc., knowing this predictive uncertainty is essential though. Therefore, we introduce, for the first time, a fast way to obtain the empirical predictive distribution during object detection and incorporate that knowledge in multi-object tracking. Our mechanism can easily be integrated into state-of-the-art trackers, enabling them to fully exploit the uncertainty in the detections. Additionally, novel association methods are introduced that leverage the proposed mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contribution on a variety of benchmarks, such as MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack, and KITTI.

### Reasoning AI Performance Degradation in 6G Networks with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Liming Huang, Yulei Wu, Dimitra Simeonidou

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:32:50Z

**Summary**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within 6G networks is poised to revolutionize connectivity, reliability, and intelligent decision-making. However, the performance of AI models in these networks is crucial, as any decline can significantly impact network efficiency and the services it supports. Understanding the root causes of performance degradation is essential for maintaining optimal network functionality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reason about AI model performance degradation in 6G networks using the Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. Our approach employs an LLM as a ''teacher'' model through zero-shot prompting to generate teaching CoT rationales, followed by a CoT ''student'' model that is fine-tuned by the generated teaching data for learning to reason about performance declines. The efficacy of this model is evaluated in a real-world scenario involving a real-time 3D rendering task with multi-Access Technologies (mATs) including WiFi, 5G, and LiFi for data transmission. Experimental results show that our approach achieves over 97% reasoning accuracy on the built test questions, confirming the validity of our collected dataset and the effectiveness of the LLM-CoT method. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of 6G networks, representing a significant advancement in the evolution of AI-native network infrastructures.

### Stochastic Layer-Wise Shuffle: A Good Practice to Improve Vision Mamba   Training
**Authors**: Zizheng Huang, Haoxing Chen, Jiaqi Li, Jun Lan, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:09:19Z

**Summary**: Recent Vision Mamba models not only have much lower complexity for processing higher resolution images and longer videos but also the competitive performance with Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, they are stuck into overfitting and thus only present up to base size (about 80M). It is still unclear how vanilla Vision Mamba (Vim) can be efficiently scaled up to larger sizes, which is essentially for further exploitation. In this paper, we propose a stochastic layer-wise shuffle regularization, which empowers successfully scaling non-hierarchical Vision Mamba to a large size (about 300M) in a supervised setting. Specifically, our base and large-scale ShuffleMamba models can outperform the supervised ViTs of similar size by 0.8\% and 1.0\% classification accuracy on ImageNet1k, respectively, without auxiliary data. When evaluated on the ADE20K semantic segmentation and COCO detection tasks, our ShuffleMamba models also show significant improvements. Without bells and whistles, the stochastic layer-wise shuffle has the following highlights: (1) \textit{Plug and play:} it does not change model architectures and will be omitted in inference. (2) \textit{Simple but effective:} it can improve the overfitting in Vim training and only introduce random token permutation operations. (3) \textit{Intuitive:} the token sequences in deeper layers are more likely to be shuffled as they are expected to be more semantic and less sensitive to patch positions. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/huangzizheng01/ShuffleMamba.

### Novel-WD: Exploring acquisition of Novel World Knowledge in LLMs Using   Prefix-Tuning
**Authors**: Maxime Méloux, Christophe Cerisara

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:54:50Z

**Summary**: Teaching new information to pre-trained large language models (PLM) is a crucial but challenging task. Model adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning and parameter-efficient training have been shown to store new facts at a slow rate; continual learning is an option but is costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This work studies and quantifies how PLM may learn and remember new world knowledge facts that do not occur in their pre-training corpus, which only contains world knowledge up to a certain date. To that purpose, we first propose Novel-WD, a new dataset consisting of sentences containing novel facts extracted from recent Wikidata updates, along with two evaluation tasks in the form of causal language modeling and multiple choice questions (MCQ). We make this dataset freely available to the community, and release a procedure to later build new versions of similar datasets with up-to-date information. We also explore the use of prefix-tuning for novel information learning, and analyze how much information can be stored within a given prefix. We show that a single fact can reliably be encoded within a single prefix, and that the prefix capacity increases with its length and with the base model size.

### AI in Space for Scientific Missions: Strategies for Minimizing   Neural-Network Model Upload
**Authors**: Jonah Ekelund, Ricardo Vinuesa, Yuri Khotyaintsev, Pierre Henri, Gian Luca Delzanno, Stefano Markidis

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:49:24Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize space exploration by delegating several spacecraft decisions to an onboard AI instead of relying on ground control and predefined procedures. It is likely that there will be an AI/ML Processing Unit onboard the spacecraft running an inference engine. The neural-network will have pre-installed parameters that can be updated onboard by uploading, by telecommands, parameters obtained by training on the ground. However, satellite uplinks have limited bandwidth and transmissions can be costly. Furthermore, a mission operating with a suboptimal neural network will miss out on valuable scientific data. Smaller networks can thereby decrease the uplink cost, while increasing the value of the scientific data that is downloaded. In this work, we evaluate and discuss the use of reduced-precision and bare-minimum neural networks to reduce the time for upload. As an example of an AI use case, we focus on the NASA's Magnetosperic MultiScale (MMS) mission. We show how an AI onboard could be used in the Earth's magnetosphere to classify data to selectively downlink higher value data or to recognize a region-of-interest to trigger a burst-mode, collecting data at a high-rate. Using a simple filtering scheme and algorithm, we show how the start and end of a region-of-interest can be detected in on a stream of classifications. To provide the classifications, we use an established Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to an accuracy >94%. We also show how the network can be reduced to a single linear layer and trained to the same accuracy as the established CNN. Thereby, reducing the overall size of the model by up to 98.9%. We further show how each network can be reduced by up to 75% of its original size, by using lower-precision formats to represent the network parameters, with a change in accuracy of less than 0.6 percentage points.

### Contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition with Dynamic Vocabulary
**Authors**: Yui Sudo, Yosuke Fukumoto, Muhammad Shakeel, Yifan Peng, Shinji Watanabe

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:43:00Z

**Summary**: Deep biasing (DB) enhances the performance of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) models for rare words or contextual phrases using a bias list. However, most existing methods treat bias phrases as sequences of subwords in a predefined static vocabulary. This naive sequence decomposition produces unnatural token patterns, significantly lowering their occurrence probability. More advanced techniques address this problem by expanding the vocabulary with additional modules, including the external language model shallow fusion or rescoring. However, they result in increasing the workload due to the additional modules. This paper proposes a dynamic vocabulary where bias tokens can be added during inference. Each entry in a bias list is represented as a single token, unlike a sequence of existing subword tokens. This approach eliminates the need to learn subword dependencies within the bias phrases. This method is easily applied to various architectures because it only expands the embedding and output layers in common E2E-ASR architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the bias phrase WER on English and Japanese datasets by 3.1 -- 4.9 points compared with the conventional DB method.

### Causal-Guided Active Learning for Debiasing Large Language Models
**Authors**: Li Du, Zhouhao Sun, Xiao Ding, Yixuan Ma, Yang Zhao, Kaitao Qiu, Ting Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:30:13Z

**Summary**: Although achieving promising performance, recent analyses show that current generative large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them for generation, leading to poor generalizability and harmfulness of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the over-optimization problem, previous prior-knowledge-based debiasing methods and fine-tuning-based debiasing methods may not be suitable for current LLMs. To address this issue, we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a casual-guided active learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs itself to automatically and autonomously identify informative biased samples and induce the bias patterns. Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.

### Estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects via Sufficient   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Pengfei Shi, Wei Zhong, Xinyu Zhang, Ningtao Wang, Xing Fu, Weiqiang Wang, Yin Jin

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:23:59Z

**Summary**: Estimating the conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is very important in causal inference and has a wide range of applications across many fields. In the estimation process of CATE, the unconfoundedness assumption is typically required to ensure the identifiability of the regression problems. When estimating CATE using high-dimensional data, there have been many variable selection methods and neural network approaches based on representation learning, while these methods do not provide a way to verify whether the subset of variables after dimensionality reduction or the learned representations still satisfy the unconfoundedness assumption during the estimation process, which can lead to ineffective estimates of the treatment effects. Additionally, these methods typically use data from only the treatment or control group when estimating the regression functions for each group. This paper proposes a novel neural network approach named \textbf{CrossNet} to learn a sufficient representation for the features, based on which we then estimate the CATE, where cross indicates that in estimating the regression functions, we used data from their own group as well as cross-utilized data from another group. Numerical simulations and empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competitive approaches.

### PIB: Prioritized Information Bottleneck Framework for Collaborative Edge   Video Analytics
**Authors**: Zhengru Fang, Senkang Hu, Liyan Yang, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:08:48Z

**Summary**: Collaborative edge sensing systems, particularly in collaborative perception systems in autonomous driving, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy and reduce blind spots with multi-view sensing capabilities. However, their limited channel capacity and the redundancy in sensory data pose significant challenges, affecting the performance of collaborative inference tasks. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Prioritized Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework for collaborative edge video analytics. We first propose a priority-based inference mechanism that jointly considers the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the camera's coverage area of the region of interest (RoI). To enable efficient inference, PIB reduces video redundancy in both spatial and temporal domains and transmits only the essential information for the downstream inference tasks. This eliminates the need to reconstruct videos on the edge server while maintaining low latency. Specifically, it derives compact, task-relevant features by employing the deterministic information bottleneck (IB) method, which strikes a balance between feature informativeness and communication costs. Given the computational challenges caused by IB-based objectives with high-dimensional data, we resort to variational approximations for feasible optimization. Compared to TOCOM-TEM, JPEG, and HEVC, PIB achieves an improvement of up to 15.1\% in mean object detection accuracy (MODA) and reduces communication costs by 66.7% when edge cameras experience poor channel conditions.

### Towards Achieving Human Parity on End-to-end Simultaneous Speech   Translation via LLM Agent
**Authors**: Shanbo Cheng, Zhichao Huang, Tom Ko, Hang Li, Ningxin Peng, Lu Xu, Qini Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:50:51Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present Cross Language Agent -- Simultaneous Interpretation, CLASI, a high-quality and human-like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters, we utilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain terminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can generate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical context, and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters, we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric, valid information proportion (VIP), which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real-world scenarios, where the speeches are often disfluent, informal, and unclear, CLASI achieves VIP of 81.3% and 78.0% for Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation directions, respectively. In contrast, state-of-the-art commercial or open-source systems only achieve 35.4% and 41.6%. On the extremely hard dataset, where other systems achieve under 13% VIP, CLASI can still achieve 70% VIP.

### Towards Effective and Efficient Non-autoregressive Decoding Using   Block-based Attention Mask
**Authors**: Tianzi Wang, Xurong Xie, Zhaoqing Li, Shoukang Hu, Zengrui Jin, Jiajun Deng, Mingyu Cui, Shujie Hu, Mengzhe Geng, Guinan Li, Helen Meng, Xunying Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:44:14Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) block-based Attention Mask Decoder (AMD) that flexibly balances performance-efficiency trade-offs for Conformer ASR systems. AMD performs parallel NAR inference within contiguous blocks of output labels that are concealed using attention masks, while conducting left-to-right AR prediction and history context amalgamation between blocks. A beam search algorithm is designed to leverage a dynamic fusion of CTC, AR Decoder, and AMD probabilities. Experiments on the LibriSpeech-100hr corpus suggest the tripartite Decoder incorporating the AMD module produces a maximum decoding speed-up ratio of 1.73x over the baseline CTC+AR decoding, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate (WER) increase on the test sets. When operating with the same decoding real time factors, statistically significant WER reductions of up to 0.7% and 0.3% absolute (5.3% and 6.1% relative) were obtained over the CTC+AR baseline.

### SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding
**Authors**: Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:42:36Z

**Summary**: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.   To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.   Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

### Uniform Inference in High-Dimensional Threshold Regression Models
**Authors**: Jiatong Li, Hongqiang Yan

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:25:50Z

**Summary**: We develop uniform inference for high-dimensional threshold regression parameters, allowing for either cross-sectional or time series data. We first establish Oracle inequalities for prediction errors and $\ell_1$ estimation errors for the Lasso estimator of the slope parameters and the threshold parameter, accommodating heteroskedastic non-subgaussian error terms and non-subgaussian covariates. Next, we derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of slope parameters by debiasing (or desparsifying) the Lasso estimator in cases with no threshold effect and with a fixed threshold effect. We show that the asymptotic distributions in both cases are the same, allowing us to perform uniform inference without specifying whether the true model is a linear or threshold regression. Finally, we demonstrate the consistent performance of our estimator in both cases through simulation studies, and we apply the proposed estimator to analyze two empirical applications.

### No top-heavy stellar initial mass function needed: the ionizing   radiation of GS9422 can be powered by a mixture of AGN and stars
**Authors**: Yijia Li, Joel Leja, Benjamin D. Johnson, Sandro Tacchella, Rohan P. Naidu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:03:04Z

**Summary**: JWST is producing high-quality rest-frame optical and UV spectra of faint galaxies at $z>4$ for the first time, challenging models of galaxy and stellar populations. One galaxy recently observed at $z=5.943$, GS9422, has nebular line and UV continuum emission that appears to require a high ionizing photon production efficiency. This has been explained with an exotic stellar initial mass function (IMF), 10-30x more top-heavy than a Salpeter IMF (Cameron et al. 2023). Here we suggest an alternate explanation to this exotic IMF. We use a new flexible neural net emulator for CLOUDY, Cue, to infer the shape of the ionizing spectrum directly from the observed emission line fluxes. By describing the ionizing spectrum with a piece-wise power-law, Cue is agnostic to the source of the ionizing photons. Cue finds that the ionizing radiation from GS9422 can be approximated by a double power law characterized by $\frac{Q_\mathrm{HeII}}{Q_\mathrm{H}} = -1.5$, which can be interpreted as a combination of young, metal-poor stars and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) with $F_{\nu} \propto \lambda ^ {2}$ in a 65%/35% ratio. This suggests a significantly lower nebular continuum contribution to the observed UV flux (24%) than a top-heavy IMF ($\gtrsim80$%), and hence, necessitates a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) to explain the continuum turnover bluewards of $\sim1400$ Angstrom. While current data cannot rule out either scenario, given the immense impact the proposed top-heavy IMF would have on models of galaxy formation, it is important to propose viable alternative explanations and to further investigate the nature of peculiar high-z nebular emitters.

### From Text to Emotion: Unveiling the Emotion Annotation Capabilities of   LLMs
**Authors**: Minxue Niu, Mimansa Jaiswal, Emily Mower Provost

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T05:50:15Z

**Summary**: Training emotion recognition models has relied heavily on human annotated data, which present diversity, quality, and cost challenges. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT4, in automating or assisting emotion annotation. We compare GPT4 with supervised models and or humans in three aspects: agreement with human annotations, alignment with human perception, and impact on model training. We find that common metrics that use aggregated human annotations as ground truth can underestimate the performance, of GPT-4 and our human evaluation experiment reveals a consistent preference for GPT-4 annotations over humans across multiple datasets and evaluators. Further, we investigate the impact of using GPT-4 as an annotation filtering process to improve model training. Together, our findings highlight the great potential of LLMs in emotion annotation tasks and underscore the need for refined evaluation methodologies.

### Dynamic Self-Consistency: Leveraging Reasoning Paths for Efficient LLM   Sampling
**Authors**: Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Jie Chen, Sheng Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T05:14:59Z

**Summary**: Self-Consistency (SC) is a widely used method to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by sampling the LLM multiple times and outputting the most frequent solution. Despite its benefits, SC results in significant computational costs proportional to the number of samples generated. Previous early-stopping approaches, such as Early Stopping Self Consistency and Adaptive Consistency, have aimed to reduce these costs by considering output consistency, but they do not analyze the quality of the reasoning paths (RPs) themselves. To address this issue, we propose Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency (RASC), an innovative early-stopping framework that dynamically adjusts the number of sample generations by considering both the output answer and the RPs from Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. RASC assigns confidence scores sequentially to the generated samples, stops when certain criteria are met, and then employs weighted majority voting to optimize sample usage and enhance answer reliability. We comprehensively test RASC with multiple LLMs across varied QA datasets. RASC outperformed existing methods and significantly reduces sample usage by an average of 80% while maintaining or improving accuracy up to 5% compared to the original SC

### Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of NED-AdS Black Holes
**Authors**: Mozib Bin Awal, Prabwal Phukon

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:50:52Z

**Summary**: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) of magnetically charged Anti de Sitter (AdS) black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics(NED). The first law and the corresponding Euler relation are examined using the scaling properties. While the mass is homogeneous in the first order, the intensive variables are observed to follow zeroth order homogeneity. We use numerical and graphical techniques to find the critical points of the various thermodynamic quantities. By utilizing the re-scaling properties of the equation of states, we study the thermodynamic processes using different pairs of variables. From our analysis, we infer that although the RPS thermodynamics of NED-AdS black hole resembles those of RN-AdS, Kerr-AdS, Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in most of its aspects, hinting at a possible universality, there exists one particular $\mu-C$ process that differs in its behaviour from its counterparts in earlier reported works.

### Retrieval-Augmented Natural Language Reasoning for Explainable Visual   Question Answering
**Authors**: Su Hyeon Lim, Minkuk Kim, Hyeon Bae Kim, Seong Tae Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:39:43Z

**Summary**: Visual Question Answering with Natural Language Explanation (VQA-NLE) task is challenging due to its high demand for reasoning-based inference. Recent VQA-NLE studies focus on enhancing model networks to amplify the model's reasoning capability but this approach is resource-consuming and unstable. In this work, we introduce a new VQA-NLE model, ReRe (Retrieval-augmented natural language Reasoning), using leverage retrieval information from the memory to aid in generating accurate answers and persuasive explanations without relying on complex networks and extra datasets. ReRe is an encoder-decoder architecture model using a pre-trained clip vision encoder and a pre-trained GPT-2 language model as a decoder. Cross-attention layers are added in the GPT-2 for processing retrieval features. ReRe outperforms previous methods in VQA accuracy and explanation score and shows improvement in NLE with more persuasive, reliability.

### Efficient Camera Exposure Control for Visual Odometry via Deep   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Shuyang Zhang, Jinhao He, Yilong Zhu, Jin Wu, Jie Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:37:52Z

**Summary**: The stability of visual odometry (VO) systems is undermined by degraded image quality, especially in environments with significant illumination changes. This study employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train agents for exposure control, aiming to enhance imaging performance in challenging conditions. A lightweight image simulator is developed to facilitate the training process, enabling the diversification of image exposure and sequence trajectory. This setup enables completely offline training, eliminating the need for direct interaction with camera hardware and the real environments. Different levels of reward functions are crafted to enhance the VO systems, equipping the DRL agents with varying intelligence. Extensive experiments have shown that our exposure control agents achieve superior efficiency-with an average inference duration of 1.58 ms per frame on a CPU-and respond more quickly than traditional feedback control schemes. By choosing an appropriate reward function, agents acquire an intelligent understanding of motion trends and anticipate future illumination changes. This predictive capability allows VO systems to deliver more stable and precise odometry results. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/ShuyangUni/drl_exposure_ctrl.

### Safety Layers of Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security
**Authors**: Shen Li, Liuyi Yao, Lan Zhang, Yaliang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:35:59Z

**Summary**: Aligned LLMs are highly secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining this security is not well understood, further these models are vulnerable to security degradation when fine-tuned with non-malicious backdoor data or normal data. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as "safety layers." We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on this understanding, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly preserves model security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.

### Emergence of Social Norms in Generative Agent Societies: Principles and   Architecture
**Authors**: Siyue Ren, Zhiyao Cui, Ruiqi Song, Zhen Wang, Shuyue Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:14:45Z

**Summary**: Social norms play a crucial role in guiding agents towards understanding and adhering to standards of behavior, thus reducing social conflicts within multi-agent systems (MASs). However, current LLM-based (or generative) MASs lack the capability to be normative. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named CRSEC, to empower the emergence of social norms within generative MASs. Our architecture consists of four modules: Creation & Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. This addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within generative MASs. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach. Our project can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/sxswz213/CRSEC.

### Token-level Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Yongcheng Zeng, Guoqing Liu, Weiyu Ma, Ning Yang, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:39:57Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions. This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models. However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion. In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level. Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO incorporates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, TDPO enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling. Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO's superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity. Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Vance0124/Token-level-Direct-Preference-Optimization.

### Tool-Assisted Agent on SQL Inspection and Refinement in Real-World   Scenarios
**Authors**: Zhongyuan Wang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie, Jaein Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:38:37Z

**Summary**: Recent Text-to-SQL methods leverage large language models (LLMs) by incorporating feedback from the database management system. While these methods effectively address execution errors in SQL queries, they struggle with database mismatches -- errors that do not trigger execution exceptions. Database mismatches include issues such as condition mismatches and stricter constraint mismatches, both of which are more prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a tool-assisted agent framework for SQL inspection and refinement, equipping the LLM-based agent with two specialized tools: a retriever and a detector, designed to diagnose and correct SQL queries with database mismatches. These tools enhance the capability of LLMs to handle real-world queries more effectively. We also introduce Spider-Mismatch, a new dataset specifically constructed to reflect the condition mismatch problems encountered in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest performance on the averaged results of the Spider and Spider-Realistic datasets in few-shot settings, and it significantly outperforms baseline methods on the more realistic dataset, Spider-Mismatch.

### From Model Explanation to Data Misinterpretation: Uncovering the   Pitfalls of Post Hoc Explainers in Business Research
**Authors**: Ronilo Ragodos, Tong Wang, Lu Feng, Yu, Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:22:35Z

**Summary**: Machine learning models have been increasingly used in business research. However, most state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as deep neural networks and XGBoost, are black boxes in nature. Therefore, post hoc explainers that provide explanations for machine learning models by, for example, estimating numerical importance of the input features, have been gaining wide usage. Despite the intended use of post hoc explainers being explaining machine learning models, we found a growing trend in business research where post hoc explanations are used to draw inferences about the data. In this work, we investigate the validity of such use. Specifically, we investigate with extensive experiments whether the explanations obtained by the two most popular post hoc explainers, SHAP and LIME, provide correct information about the true marginal effects of X on Y in the data, which we call data-alignment. We then identify what factors influence the alignment of explanations. Finally, we propose a set of mitigation strategies to improve the data-alignment of explanations and demonstrate their effectiveness with real-world data in an econometric context. In spite of this effort, we nevertheless conclude that it is often not appropriate to infer data insights from post hoc explanations. We articulate appropriate alternative uses, the most important of which is to facilitate the proposition and subsequent empirical investigation of hypotheses. The ultimate goal of this paper is to caution business researchers against translating post hoc explanations of machine learning models into potentially false insights and understanding of data.

### AdaptVision: Dynamic Input Scaling in MLLMs for Versatile Scene   Understanding
**Authors**: Yonghui Wang, Wengang Zhou, Hao Feng, Houqiang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:16:49Z

**Summary**: Over the past few years, the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has captured the wide interest of researchers, leading to numerous innovations to enhance MLLMs' comprehension. In this paper, we present AdaptVision, a multimodal large language model specifically designed to dynamically process input images at varying resolutions. We hypothesize that the requisite number of visual tokens for the model is contingent upon both the resolution and content of the input image. Generally, natural images with a lower information density can be effectively interpreted by the model using fewer visual tokens at reduced resolutions. In contrast, images containing textual content, such as documents with rich text, necessitate a higher number of visual tokens for accurate text interpretation due to their higher information density. Building on this insight, we devise a dynamic image partitioning module that adjusts the number of visual tokens according to the size and aspect ratio of images. This method mitigates distortion effects that arise from resizing images to a uniform resolution and dynamically optimizing the visual tokens input to the LLMs. Our model is capable of processing images with resolutions up to $1008\times 1008$.

### Addressing Duplicated Data in Point Process Models
**Authors**: Lingling Chen, Mikyoung Jun, Scott J. Cook

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:04:25Z

**Summary**: Spatial point process models are widely applied to point pattern data from various fields in the social and environmental sciences. However, a serious hurdle in fitting point process models is the presence of duplicated points, wherein multiple observations share identical spatial coordinates. This often occurs because of decisions made in the geo-coding process, such as assigning representative locations (e.g., aggregate-level centroids) to observations when data producers lack exact location information. Because spatial point process models like the Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) assume unique locations, researchers often employ {\it ad hoc} solutions (e.g., jittering) to address duplicated data before analysis. As an alternative, this study proposes a Modified Minimum Contrast (MMC) method that adapts the inference procedure to account for the effect of duplicates without needing to alter the data. The proposed MMC method is applied to LGCP models, with simulation results demonstrating the gains of our method relative to existing approaches in terms of parameter estimation. Interestingly, simulation results also show the effect of the geo-coding process on parameter estimates, which can be utilized in the implementation of the MMC method. The MMC approach is then used to infer the spatial clustering characteristics of conflict events in Afghanistan (2008-2009).

### Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming
**Authors**: Zhifei Xie, Changqiao Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:53:48Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.

**Authors**: Jinghan Yao, Sam Ade Jacobs, Masahiro Tanaka, Olatunji Ruwase, Aamir Shafi, Hari Subramoni, Dhabaleswar K. Panda

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:44:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.

### MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling
**Authors**: Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bui1dMySea/MemLong

### UserSumBench: A Benchmark Framework for Evaluating User Summarization   Approaches
**Authors**: Chao Wang, Neo Wu, Lin Ning, Luyang Liu, Jun Xie, Shawn O'Banion, Bradley Green

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:56:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating user summaries from a long list of raw user activity data. These summaries capture essential user information such as preferences and interests, and therefore are invaluable for LLM-based personalization applications, such as explainable recommender systems. However, the development of new summarization techniques is hindered by the lack of ground-truth labels, the inherent subjectivity of user summaries, and human evaluation which is often costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce \UserSumBench, a benchmark framework designed to facilitate iterative development of LLM-based summarization approaches. This framework offers two key components: (1) A reference-free summary quality metric. We show that this metric is effective and aligned with human preferences across three diverse datasets (MovieLens, Yelp and Amazon Review). (2) A novel robust summarization method that leverages time-hierarchical summarizer and self-critique verifier to produce high-quality summaries while eliminating hallucination. This method serves as a strong baseline for further innovation in summarization techniques.

### MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing: Predicting Image Adjustments Utilizing   MiniGPT-4
**Authors**: Vahid Azizi, Fatemeh Koochaki

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:50:37Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available at this \href{https://github.com/VahidAz/MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing}

### Causal Representation-Based Domain Generalization on Gaze Estimation
**Authors**: Younghan Kim, Kangryun Moon, Yongjun Park, Yonggyu Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:45:22Z

**Summary**: The availability of extensive datasets containing gaze information for each subject has significantly enhanced gaze estimation accuracy. However, the discrepancy between domains severely affects a model's performance explicitly trained for a particular domain. In this paper, we propose the Causal Representation-Based Domain Generalization on Gaze Estimation (CauGE) framework designed based on the general principle of causal mechanisms, which is consistent with the domain difference. We employ an adversarial training manner and an additional penalizing term to extract domain-invariant features. After extracting features, we position the attention layer to make features sufficient for inferring the actual gaze. By leveraging these modules, CauGE ensures that the neural networks learn from representations that meet the causal mechanisms' general principles. By this, CauGE generalizes across domains by extracting domain-invariant features, and spurious correlations cannot influence the model. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the domain generalization on gaze estimation benchmark.

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:19:42Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs, which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today, these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT, TBT, Normalised Latency and TPOT). However, these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference, leading to an incomplete assessment of user-facing performance crucial for real-time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper, we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Etalon, a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity-index -- a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real-time user experience. Finally, we evaluate various existing open-source platforms and model-as-a-service offerings using Etalon, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Etalon is available at https://github.com/project-etalon/etalon.

### Weakly-Supervised 3D Visual Grounding based on Visual Linguistic   Alignment
**Authors**: Xiaoxu Xu, Yitian Yuan, Qiudan Zhang, Wenhui Wu, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma, Xu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:07:08Z

**Summary**: Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.

### WhiteFox: White-Box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenyuan Yang, Yinlin Deng, Runyu Lu, Jiayi Yao, Jiawei Liu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand, Lingming Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:00:09Z

**Summary**: Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences. Fuzzing has been studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.   To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the generation on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations, practicing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101 bugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 fixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being incorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains.

### Photospheric Pore Rotation Associated with a C-class Flare from   Spectropolarimetric Observations with DKIST
**Authors**: Rahul Yadav, Maria D. Kazachenko, Andrey N. Afanasyev, Gianna Cauzzi, Kevin Reardon

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T00:52:37Z

**Summary**: We present high-resolution observations of a C4.1-class solar flare (SOL2023-05-03T20:53) in AR 13293 from the ViSP and VBI instruments at the DKIST. The fast cadence, good resolution, and high polarimetric sensitivity of ViSP data provide a unique opportunity to explore the photospheric magnetic fields before and during the flare. We infer the magnetic field vector in the photosphere from the Fe I 6302 line using Milne-Eddington inversions. Combined analysis of the inverted data and VBI images reveals the presence of two oppositely-polarity pores exhibiting rotational motion both prior to and throughout the flare event. Data-driven simulations further reveal a complex magnetic field topology above the rotating pores, including a null-point-like configuration. We observed a 30% relative change in the horizontal component ($\delta F_h$) of Lorentz force at the flare peak time and roughly no change in the radial component. We find that the changes in $\delta F_h$ are the most likely driver of the observed pore rotation. These findings collectively suggest that the back-reaction of magnetic field line reconfiguration in the corona may influence the magnetic morphology and rotation of pores in the photosphere on a significantly smaller scale.

### A longitudinal sentiment analysis of Sinophobia during COVID-19 using   large language models
**Authors**: Chen Wang, Rohitash Chandra

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:39:11Z

**Summary**: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia, particularly Sinophobia, leading to widespread discrimination against individuals of Chinese descent. Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained deep learning models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The ability of LLMs to understand and generate human-like text makes them particularly useful for analysing social media data to detect and evaluate sentiments. We present a sentiment analysis framework utilising LLMs for longitudinal sentiment analysis of the Sinophobic sentiments expressed in X (Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show a significant correlation between the spikes in Sinophobic tweets, Sinophobic sentiments and surges in COVID-19 cases, revealing that the evolution of the pandemic influenced public sentiment and the prevalence of Sinophobic discourse. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis revealed a predominant presence of negative sentiments, such as annoyance and denial, which underscores the impact of political narratives and misinformation shaping public opinion. The lack of empathetic sentiment which was present in previous studies related to COVID-19 highlights the way the political narratives in media viewed the pandemic and how it blamed the Chinese community. Our study highlights the importance of transparent communication in mitigating xenophobic sentiments during global crises.

### A Machine Learning-based Approach for Solving Recurrence Relations and   its use in Cost Analysis of Logic Programs
**Authors**: Louis Rustenholz, Maximiliano Klemen, Miguel Ángel Carreira-Perpiñán, Pedro López-García

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:21:57Z

**Summary**: Automatic static cost analysis infers information about the resources used by programs without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such information as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for logic programs (and many for other languages), as CiaoPP, are based on setting up recurrence relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of predicates, and solving them to find closed-form functions. Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the recurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with state-of-the-art solvers, including Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for different classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a challenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary, constrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning (sparse-linear and symbolic) regression techniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an SMT-solver and a CAS to check if it is actually a solution of the recurrence. Our prototype implementation and its experimental evaluation within the context of the CiaoPP system show quite promising results. Overall, for the considered benchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art cost analyzers and recurrence solvers, and solves recurrences that cannot be solved by them.

### Estimating Direct and Indirect Causal Effects of Spatiotemporal   Interventions in Presence of Spatial Interference
**Authors**: Sahara Ali, Omar Faruque, Jianwu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:21:03Z

**Summary**: Spatial interference (SI) occurs when the treatment at one location affects the outcomes at other locations. Accounting for spatial interference in spatiotemporal settings poses further challenges as interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, making it infeasible for standard causal inference methods to quantify the effects of time-varying treatment at spatially varying outcomes. In this paper, we first formalize the concept of spatial interference in case of time-varying treatment assignments by extending the potential outcome framework under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. We then propose our deep learning based potential outcome model for spatiotemporal causal inference. We utilize latent factor modeling to reduce the bias due to time-varying confounding while leveraging the power of U-Net architecture to capture global and local spatial interference in data over time. Our causal estimators are an extension of average treatment effect (ATE) for estimating direct (DATE) and indirect effects (IATE) of spatial interference on treated and untreated data. Being the first of its kind deep learning based spatiotemporal causal inference technique, our approach shows advantages over several baseline methods based on the experiment results on two synthetic datasets, with and without spatial interference. Our results on real-world climate dataset also align with domain knowledge, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls   using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction
**Authors**: Yupeng Cao, Zhi Chen, Qingyun Pei, Nathan Jinseok Lee, K. P. Subbalakshmi, Papa Momar Ndiaye

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:13:56Z

**Summary**: In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock volatility is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, more predictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We use the pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCs and implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract more fine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level general information by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focus sentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are then fused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional analytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniques in financial analysis.

### Plausible-Parrots @ MSP2023: Enhancing Semantic Plausibility Modeling   using Entity and Event Knowledge
**Authors**: Chong Shen, Chenyue Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:13:45Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of injecting external knowledge to a large language model (LLM) to identify semantic plausibility of simple events. Specifically, we enhance the LLM with fine-grained entity types, event types and their definitions extracted from an external knowledge base. These knowledge are injected into our system via designed templates. We also augment the data to balance the label distribution and adapt the task setting to real world scenarios in which event mentions are expressed as natural language sentences. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the injected knowledge on modeling semantic plausibility of events. An error analysis further emphasizes the importance of identifying non-trivial entity and event types.

### An Order Theory Framework of Recurrence Equations for Static Cost   Analysis $-$ Dynamic Inference of Non-Linear Inequality Invariants
**Authors**: Louis Rustenholz, Pedro Lopez-Garcia, José F. Morales, Manuel V. Hermenegildo

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:12:51Z

**Summary**: Recurrence equations have played a central role in static cost analysis, where they can be viewed as abstractions of programs and used to infer resource usage information without actually running the programs with concrete data. Such information is typically represented as functions of input data sizes. More generally, recurrence equations have been increasingly used to automatically obtain non-linear numerical invariants. However, state-of-the-art recurrence solvers and cost analysers suffer from serious limitations when dealing with the (complex) features of recurrences arising from cost analyses. We address this challenge by developing a novel order-theoretical framework where recurrences are viewed as operators and their solutions as fixpoints, which allows leveraging powerful pre/postfixpoint search techniques. We prove useful properties and provide principles and insights that enable us to develop techniques and combine them to design new solvers. We have also implemented and experimentally evaluated an optimisation-based instantiation of the proposed approach. The results are quite promising: our prototype outperforms state-of-the-art cost analysers and recurrence solvers, and can infer tight non-linear lower/upper bounds, in a reasonable time, for complex recurrences representing diverse program behaviours.

### Network Inference in Public Administration: Questions, Challenges, and   Models of Causality
**Authors**: Travis A. Whetsell, Michael D. Siciliano

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T22:29:19Z

**Summary**: Descriptive and inferential social network analysis has become common in public administration studies of network governance and management. A large literature has developed in two broad categories: antecedents of network structure, and network effects and outcomes. A new topic is emerging on network interventions that applies knowledge of network formation and effects to actively intervene in the social context of interaction. Yet, the question remains how might scholars deploy and determine the impact of network interventions. Inferential network analysis has primarily focused on statistical simulations of network distributions to produce probability estimates on parameters of interest in observed networks, e.g. ERGMs. There is less attention to design elements for causal inference in the network context, such as experimental interventions, randomization, control and comparison networks, and spillovers. We advance a number of important questions for network research, examine important inferential challenges and other issues related to inference in networks, and focus on a set of possible network inference models. We categorize models of network inference into (i) observational studies of networks, using descriptive and stochastic methods that lack intervention, randomization, or comparison networks; (ii) simulation studies that leverage computational resources for generating inference; (iii) natural network experiments, with unintentional network-based interventions; (iv) network field experiments, with designed interventions accompanied by comparison networks; and (v) laboratory experiments that design and implement randomization to treatment and control networks. The article offers a guide to network researchers interested in questions, challenges, and models of inference for network analysis in public administration.

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T22:18:08Z

**Summary**: Chronic diseases such as diabetes are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Numerous research studies have been attempted with various deep learning models in diagnosis. However, most previous studies had certain limitations, including using publicly available datasets (e.g. MIMIC), and imbalanced data. In this study, we collected five-year electronic health records (EHRs) from the Taiwan hospital database, including 1,420,596 clinical notes, 387,392 laboratory test results, and more than 1,505 laboratory test items, focusing on research pre-training large language models. We proposed a novel Large Language Multimodal Models (LLMMs) framework incorporating multimodal data from clinical notes and laboratory test results for the prediction of chronic disease risk. Our method combined a text embedding encoder and multi-head attention layer to learn laboratory test values, utilizing a deep neural network (DNN) module to merge blood features with chronic disease semantics into a latent space. In our experiments, we observe that clinicalBERT and PubMed-BERT, when combined with attention fusion, can achieve an accuracy of 73% in multiclass chronic diseases and diabetes prediction. By transforming laboratory test values into textual descriptions and employing the Flan T-5 model, we achieved a 76% Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC), demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging numerical text data for training and inference in language models. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of early-stage diabetes prediction.

### Use of a Structured Knowledge Base Enhances Metadata Curation by Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Sowmya S. Sundaram, Benjamin Solomon, Avani Khatri, Anisha Laumas, Purvesh Khatri, Mark A. Musen

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T21:34:22Z

**Summary**: Metadata play a crucial role in ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of datasets. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to improve adherence to metadata standards. We conducted experiments on 200 random data records describing human samples relating to lung cancer from the NCBI BioSample repository, evaluating GPT-4's ability to suggest edits for adherence to metadata standards. We computed the adherence accuracy of field name-field value pairs through a peer review process, and we observed a marginal average improvement in adherence to the standard data dictionary from 79% to 80% (p<0.5). We then prompted GPT-4 with domain information in the form of the textual descriptions of CEDAR templates and recorded a significant improvement to 97% from 79% (p<0.01). These results indicate that, while LLMs may not be able to correct legacy metadata to ensure satisfactory adherence to standards when unaided, they do show promise for use in automated metadata curation when integrated with a structured knowledge base

**Summary**: It is a mystery how the brain decodes color vision purely from the optic nerve signals it receives, with a core inferential challenge being how it disentangles internal perception with the correct color dimensionality from the unknown encoding properties of the eye. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by simulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how the cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming that the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the visual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color dimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate our theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on established vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from looking at natural images. Further, we propose a model of cortical learning based on self-supervised principle and show that this model naturally learns to generate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory signals. When the retina contains N types of color photoreceptors, our simulation shows that N-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified through formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first simulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed in gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of enhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D.

 ### SYNTHEVAL: Hybrid Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Synthetic   CheckLists
**Authors**: Raoyuan Zhao, Abdullatif Köksal, Yihong Liu, Leonie Weissweiler, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T17:41:30Z

**Summary**: Traditional benchmarking in NLP typically involves using static held-out test sets. However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench (Kiela et al., 2021) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multistep human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires much human labor, often at prohibitive cost. In this work, we propose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models. In the last stage, human experts investigate the challenging examples, manually design templates, and identify the types of failures the taskspecific models consistently exhibit. We apply SYNTHEVAL to two classification tasks, sentiment analysis and toxic language detection, and show that our framework is effective in identifying weaknesses of strong models on these tasks. We share our code in https://github.com/Loreley99/SynthEval_CheckList.

### Advancing Multi-talker ASR Performance with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mohan Shi, Zengrui Jin, Yaoxun Xu, Yong Xu, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Kun Wei, Yiwen Shao, Chunlei Zhang, Dong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T17:29:25Z

**Summary**: Recognizing overlapping speech from multiple speakers in conversational scenarios is one of the most challenging problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Serialized output training (SOT) is a classic method to address multi-talker ASR, with the idea of concatenating transcriptions from multiple speakers according to the emission times of their speech for training. However, SOT-style transcriptions, derived from concatenating multiple related utterances in a conversation, depend significantly on modeling long contexts. Therefore, compared to traditional methods that primarily emphasize encoder performance in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architectures, a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained decoders may be better suited for such complex and challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based SOT approach for multi-talker ASR, leveraging pre-trained speech encoder and LLM, fine-tuning them on multi-talker dataset using appropriate strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional AED-based methods on the simulated dataset LibriMix and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation set of the real-world dataset AMI, outperforming the AED model trained with 1000 times more supervised data in previous works.

### Getting Inspiration for Feature Elicitation: App Store- vs. LLM-based   Approach
**Authors**: Jialiang Wei, Anne-Lise Courbis, Thomas Lambolais, Binbin Xu, Pierre Louis Bernard, Gérard Dray, Walid Maalej

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:42:26Z

**Summary**: Over the past decade, app store (AppStore)-inspired requirements elicitation has proven to be highly beneficial. Developers often explore competitors' apps to gather inspiration for new features. With the advance of Generative AI, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of large language model (LLM)-inspired requirements elicitation. LLMs can assist in this process by providing inspiration for new feature ideas. While both approaches are gaining popularity in practice, there is a lack of insight into their differences. We report on a comparative study between AppStore- and LLM-based approaches for refining features into sub-features. By manually analyzing 1,200 sub-features recommended from both approaches, we identified their benefits, challenges, and key differences. While both approaches recommend highly relevant sub-features with clear descriptions, LLMs seem more powerful particularly concerning novel unseen app scopes. Moreover, some recommended features are imaginary with unclear feasibility, which suggests the importance of a human-analyst in the elicitation loop.

### Exploring Group and Symmetry Principles in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shima Imani, Hamid Palangi

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:42:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of applications; however, assessing their reasoning capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a framework grounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in fields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their capabilities. While the proposed framework is general, to showcase the benefits of employing these properties, we focus on arithmetic reasoning and investigate the performance of these models on four group properties: closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. Our findings reveal that LLMs studied in this work struggle to preserve group properties across different test regimes. In the closure test, we observe biases towards specific outputs and an abrupt degradation in their performance from 100% to 0% after a specific sequence length. They also perform poorly in the identity test, which represents adding irrelevant information in the context, and show sensitivity when subjected to inverse test, which examines the robustness of the model with respect to negation. In addition, we demonstrate that breaking down problems into smaller steps helps LLMs in the associativity test that we have conducted. To support these tests we have developed a synthetic dataset which will be released.

### Question-Based Retrieval using Atomic Units for Enterprise RAG
**Authors**: Vatsal Raina, Mark Gales

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:23:13Z

**Summary**: Enterprise retrieval augmented generation (RAG) offers a highly flexible framework for combining powerful large language models (LLMs) with internal, possibly temporally changing, documents. In RAG, documents are first chunked. Relevant chunks are then retrieved for a user query, which are passed as context to a synthesizer LLM to generate the query response. However, the retrieval step can limit performance, as incorrect chunks can lead the synthesizer LLM to generate a false response. This work applies a zero-shot adaptation of standard dense retrieval steps for more accurate chunk recall. Specifically, a chunk is first decomposed into atomic statements. A set of synthetic questions are then generated on these atoms (with the chunk as the context). Dense retrieval involves finding the closest set of synthetic questions, and associated chunks, to the user query. It is found that retrieval with the atoms leads to higher recall than retrieval with chunks. Further performance gain is observed with retrieval using the synthetic questions generated over the atoms. Higher recall at the retrieval step enables higher performance of the enterprise LLM using the RAG pipeline.

**Authors**: Junhao Ruan, Abudukeyumu Abudula, Xinyu Liu, Bei Li, Yinqiao Li, Chenglong Wang, Yuchun Fan, Yuan Ge, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:13:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained on next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm have demonstrated powerful capabilities. However, the existing NTP paradigm contains several limitations, particularly related to planned task complications and error propagation during inference. In our work, we extend the critique of NTP, highlighting its limitation also due to training with a narrow objective: the prediction of a sub-optimal one-hot distribution. To support this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output distribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By evaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot distribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more closely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we introduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$-gram distributions to replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online training time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task, language transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can achieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average improvement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the medical domain. This demonstrates the concrete benefits of addressing the target narrowing problem, pointing to a new direction for future work on improving NTP.

### Evaluation and Deployment of LiDAR-based Place Recognition in Dense   Forests
**Authors**: Haedam Oh, Nived Chebrolu, Matias Mattamala, Leonard Freißmuth, Maurice Fallon

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T16:06:52Z

**Summary**: Many LiDAR place recognition systems have been developed and tested specifically for urban driving scenarios. Their performance in natural environments such as forests and woodlands have been studied less closely. In this paper, we analyzed the capabilities of four different LiDAR place recognition systems, both handcrafted and learning-based methods, using LiDAR data collected with a handheld device and legged robot within dense forest environments. In particular, we focused on evaluating localization where there is significant translational and orientation difference between corresponding LiDAR scan pairs. This is particularly important for forest survey systems where the sensor or robot does not follow a defined road or path. Extending our analysis we then incorporated the best performing approach, Logg3dNet, into a full 6-DoF pose estimation system -- introducing several verification layers for precise registration. We demonstrated the performance of our methods in three operational modes: online SLAM, offline multi-mission SLAM map merging, and relocalization into a prior map. We evaluated these modes using data captured in forests from three different countries, achieving 80% of correct loop closures candidates with baseline distances up to 5m, and 60% up to 10m.

### Assessing Generative Language Models in Classification Tasks:   Performance and Self-Evaluation Capabilities in the Environmental and Climate   Change Domain
**Authors**: Francesca Grasso, Stefano Locci

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T15:52:41Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3.5 and Llama2 and one Small Language Model (SLM) Gemma, across three different classification tasks within the climate change (CC) and environmental domain. Employing BERT-based models as a baseline, we compare their efficacy against these transformer-based models. Additionally, we assess the models' self-evaluation capabilities by analyzing the calibration of verbalized confidence scores in these text classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while BERT-based models generally outperform both the LLMs and SLM, the performance of the large generative models is still noteworthy. Furthermore, our calibration analysis reveals that although Gemma is well-calibrated in initial tasks, it thereafter produces inconsistent results; Llama is reasonably calibrated, and GPT consistently exhibits strong calibration. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the utility and effectiveness of generative LMs in addressing some of the planet's most urgent issues, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of ecology and CC.

### Evolving Virtual World with Delta-Engine
**Authors**: Hongqiu Wu, Zekai Xu, Tianyang Xu, Shize Wei, Yan Wang, Jiale Hong, Weiqi Wu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang, Zhezhi He

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T15:08:32Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the \emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace where people can live in. An ideal virtual world shares great similarity with our real world. One of the crucial aspects is its evolving nature, reflected by individuals' capability to grow and thereby influence the objective world. Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems. For this, we propose a special engine called \textbf{\emph{Delta-Engine}} to drive this virtual world. $\Delta$ associates the world's evolution to the engine's scalability. It consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the virtual world; given a trigger, the neural proxy generates new snippets on the base engine through \emph{incremental prediction}. This paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to unknown elements within the world, Technically, it derives from the prefect co-work of the neural proxy and the base engine, and the alignment with high-quality data. We introduce an engine-oriented fine-tuning method that embeds the base engine into the proxy. We then discuss the human-LLM collaborative design to produce novel and interesting data efficiently. Eventually, we propose three evaluation principles to comprehensively assess the performance of a delta engine: naive evaluation, incremental evaluation, and adversarial evaluation.

### Language models align with human judgments on key grammatical   constructions
**Authors**: Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald, Gary Lupyan, Anna Ivanova, Roger Levy

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:43:22Z

**Summary**: Do large language models (LLMs) make human-like linguistic generalizations? Dentella et al. (2023) ("DGL") prompt several LLMs ("Is the following sentence grammatically correct in English?") to elicit grammaticality judgments of 80 English sentences, concluding that LLMs demonstrate a "yes-response bias" and a "failure to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences". We re-evaluate LLM performance using well-established practices and find that DGL's data in fact provide evidence for just how well LLMs capture human behaviors. Models not only achieve high accuracy overall, but also capture fine-grained variation in human linguistic judgments.

### Bridging Domain Knowledge and Process Discovery Using Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Ali Norouzifar, Humam Kourani, Marcus Dees, Wil van der Aalst

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:23:40Z

**Summary**: Discovering good process models is essential for different process analysis tasks such as conformance checking and process improvements. Automated process discovery methods often overlook valuable domain knowledge. This knowledge, including insights from domain experts and detailed process documentation, remains largely untapped during process discovery. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate such knowledge directly into process discovery. We use rules derived from LLMs to guide model construction, ensuring alignment with both domain knowledge and actual process executions. By integrating LLMs, we create a bridge between process knowledge expressed in natural language and the discovery of robust process models, advancing process discovery methodologies significantly. To showcase the usability of our framework, we conducted a case study with the UWV employee insurance agency, demonstrating its practical benefits and effectiveness.

### Automatic Library Migration Using Large Language Models: First Results
**Authors**: Aylton Almeida, Laerte Xavier, Marco Tulio Valente

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T14:17:46Z

**Summary**: Despite being introduced only a few years ago, Large Language Models (LLMs) are already widely used by developers for code generation. However, their application in automating other Software Engineering activities remains largely unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we report the first results of a study in which we are exploring the use of ChatGPT to support API migration tasks, an important problem that demands manual effort and attention from developers. Specifically, in the paper, we share our initial results involving the use of ChatGPT to migrate a client application to use a newer version of SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library widely used in Python. We evaluate the use of three types of prompts (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Chain Of Thoughts) and show that the best results are achieved by the One-Shot prompt, followed by the Chain Of Thoughts. Particularly, with the One-Shot prompt we were able to successfully migrate all columns of our target application and upgrade its code to use new functionalities enabled by SQLAlchemy's latest version, such as Python's asyncio and typing modules, while preserving the original code behavior.

### Minor DPO reject penalty to increase training robustness
**Authors**: Shiming Xie, Hong Chen, Fred Yu, Zeye Sun, Xiuyu Wu, Yingfan Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:54:36Z

**Summary**: Learning from human preference is a paradigm used in large-scale language model (LLM) fine-tuning step to better align pretrained LLM to human preference for downstream task. In the past it uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to optimize the LLM policy to align with these preferences and not to draft too far from the original model. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed to solve the alignment problem with a simplified RL-free method. Using preference pairs of chosen and reject data, DPO models the relative log probability as implicit reward function and optimize LLM policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective directly. DPO is quite straight forward and easy to be understood. It perform efficiently and well in most cases. In this article, we analyze the working mechanism of $\beta$ in DPO, disclose its syntax difference between RL algorithm and DPO, and understand the potential shortage brought by the DPO simplification. With these insights, we propose MinorDPO, which is better aligned to the original RL algorithm, and increase the stability of preference optimization process.

### All You Need is Group Actions: Advancing Robust Autonomous Planning
**Authors**: Vincenzo Basco

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:50:00Z

**Summary**: Managing the plan of constellation of satellites for target observation requires optimal deployment and efficient operational strategies. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on group theory tools through multi-agent constraint optimization techniques, designed for the dynamic landscapes of satellite operations. Inspired by group actions, our method models the planning problem for observing Earth targets as a cooperative game to achieve computational efficiency while simultaneously reducing computational complexity. Designed for the complex task of planning constellation of satellites, our methodology provides a feasible solution to the inherent challenges of multi-agent optimization under state constraints and subject to uncertainties. Our approach can offer avenues for improving mission efficiency and reducing costs. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the good performance of the approach in the presence of inter-satellite links.

### Diversifying the Mixture-of-Experts Representation for Language Models   with Orthogonal Optimizer
**Authors**: Boan Liu, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Keqin Peng, Yu Cao, Dazhao Cheng, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:39:56Z

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a highly successful technique in deep learning, based on the principle of divide-and-conquer to maximize model capacity without significant additional computational cost. Even in the era of large-scale language models (LLMs), MoE continues to play a crucial role, as some researchers have indicated that GPT-4 adopts the MoE structure to ensure diverse inference results. However, MoE is susceptible to performance degeneracy, particularly evident in the issues of imbalance and homogeneous representation among experts. While previous studies have extensively addressed the problem of imbalance, the challenge of homogeneous representation remains unresolved. In this study, we shed light on the homogeneous representation problem, wherein experts in the MoE fail to specialize and lack diversity, leading to frustratingly high similarities in their representations (up to 99\% in a well-performed MoE model). This problem restricts the expressive power of the MoE and, we argue, contradicts its original intention. To tackle this issue, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective solution: OMoE, an orthogonal expert optimizer. Additionally, we introduce an alternating training strategy that encourages each expert to update in a direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by other experts. Our algorithm facilitates MoE training in two key ways: firstly, it explicitly enhances representation diversity, and secondly, it implicitly fosters interaction between experts during orthogonal weights computation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed optimization algorithm significantly improves the performance of fine-tuning the MoE model on the GLUE benchmark, SuperGLUE benchmark, question-answering task, and name entity recognition tasks.

### Suspended lithium niobate acoustic resonators with buried electrodes for   radiofrequency filtering
**Authors**: Silvan Stettler, Luis Guillermo Villanueva

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T13:30:09Z

**Summary**: Data rates and volume for mobile communication are ever-increasing with the growing number of users and connected devices. With the deployment of 5G and 6G on the horizon, wireless communication is advancing to higher frequencies and larger bandwidths enabling higher speeds and throughput. Current micro-acoustic resonator technology, a key component in radiofrequency front end filters, is struggling to keep pace with these developments. This work presents a novel acoustic resonator architecture enabling multi-frequency, low-loss, and wideband filtering for the 5G and future 6G bands located above 3 GHz. Thanks to the exceptional performance of these resonators, filters for the 5G n77 and n79 bands are demonstrated, exhibiting fractional bandwidths of 13% and 25% respectively with low insertion loss of around 1 dB. With its unique frequency scalability and wideband capabilities, the reported architecture offers a promising option for filtering and multiplexing in future mobile devices.

### VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time   Series Forecasters
**Authors**: Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:51:55Z

**Summary**: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.

**Authors**: Jian Ma, Yonglin Deng, Chen Chen, Haonan Lu, Zhenyu Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:44:44Z

**Summary**: Posters play a crucial role in marketing and advertising by enhancing visual communication and brand visibility, making significant contributions to industrial design. With the latest advancements in controllable T2I diffusion models, increasing research has focused on rendering text within synthesized images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of automatic poster generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an automatic poster generation framework with text rendering capabilities leveraging LLMs, utilizing a triple-cross attention mechanism based on alignment learning. This framework aims to create precise poster text within a detailed contextual background. Additionally, the framework supports controllable fonts, adjustable image resolution, and the rendering of posters with descriptions and text in both English and Chinese.Furthermore, we introduce a high-resolution font dataset and a poster dataset with resolutions exceeding 1024 pixels. Our approach leverages the SDXL architecture. Extensive experiments validate our method's capability in generating poster images with complex and contextually rich backgrounds.Codes is available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/GlyphDraw2.

### Improving Online Source-free Domain Adaptation for Object Detection by   Unsupervised Data Acquisition
**Authors**: Xiangyu Shi, Yanyuan Qiao, Qi Wu, Lingqiao Liu, Feras Dayoub

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T12:31:40Z

**Summary**: Effective object detection in autonomous vehicles is challenged by deployment in diverse and unfamiliar environments. Online Source-Free Domain Adaptation (O-SFDA) offers model adaptation using a stream of unlabeled data from a target domain in an online manner. However, not all captured frames contain information beneficial for adaptation, especially in the presence of redundant data and class imbalance issues. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance O-SFDA for adaptive object detection through unsupervised data acquisition. Our methodology prioritizes the most informative unlabeled frames for inclusion in the online training process. Empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset reveals that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art O-SFDA techniques, demonstrating the viability of unsupervised data acquisition for improving the adaptive object detector.

### Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey
**Authors**: Sibo Yi, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Jiaxing Song, Ke Xu, Qi Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:57:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.

### SynDL: A Large-Scale Synthetic Test Collection for Passage Retrieval
**Authors**: Hossein A. Rahmani, Xi Wang, Emine Yilmaz, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Paul Thomas

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:48:40Z

**Summary**: Large-scale test collections play a crucial role in Information Retrieval (IR) research. However, according to the Cranfield paradigm and the research into publicly available datasets, the existing information retrieval research studies are commonly developed on small-scale datasets that rely on human assessors for relevance judgments - a time-intensive and expensive process. Recent studies have shown the strong capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in producing reliable relevance judgments with human accuracy but at a greatly reduced cost. In this paper, to address the missing large-scale ad-hoc document retrieval dataset, we extend the TREC Deep Learning Track (DL) test collection via additional language model synthetic labels to enable researchers to test and evaluate their search systems at a large scale. Specifically, such a test collection includes more than 1,900 test queries from the previous years of tracks. We compare system evaluation with past human labels from past years and find that our synthetically created large-scale test collection can lead to highly correlated system rankings.

**Authors**: Jing Li, Zhijie Sun, Dachao Lin, Xuan He, Yi Lin, Binfan Zheng, Li Zeng, Rongqian Zhao, Xin Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:32:48Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach for large language models (LLMs), offering unprecedented computational efficiency. However, these architectures grapple with challenges of token distribution imbalance and expert homogenization, impeding optimal semantic generalization. We introduce a novel framework that redefines MoE routing through affinity-driven active selection. The innovations for the framework encompass: (1) A rigorous formulation of expert-token affinity metrics. (2) An adaptive bidirectional selection mechanism leveraging resonance between experts and tokens. (3) Theoretical derivation and experimental evidence of reduced expert capacity bounds under dynamic token distribution evolution. It is also integrated with orthogonal feature extraction module and an optimized loss function for expert localization. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach mitigates expert homogenization while enabling substantial capacity boundary reduction. Experimental validation corroborates these findings: it achieves a 40% reduction in token processed by each expert without compromising model convergence or efficacy. When coupled with communication optimizations, the training efficiency improvements of 5.4% to 46.6% can be observed. After supervised fine-tuning, it exhibits performance gains of 9.7% to 14.1% across GDAD, C-Eval, and TeleQnA benchmarks.

### TaSL: Task Skill Localization and Consolidation for Language Model   Continual Learning
**Authors**: Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T11:14:17Z

**Summary**: Language model continual learning (CL) has recently attracted significant interest for its ability to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world scenarios without retraining. A major challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL framework for language models, named Task Skill Localization and Consolidation (TaSL), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay. TaSL initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter dependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a novel group-wise skill localization technique to ascertain the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves an optimal balance between retaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and adaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable extensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay techniques. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two CL benchmarks, involving models ranging from 220M to 7B parameters, affirm the effectiveness of TaSL and its variants across different settings.

### Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio   Language Model
**Authors**: Zhen Ye, Peiwen Sun, Jiahe Lei, Hongzhan Lin, Xu Tan, Zheqi Dai, Qiuqiang Kong, Jianyi Chen, Jiahao Pan, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:24:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)

### ConCodeEval: Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Constraints in   Domain-Specific Languages
**Authors**: Mehant Kammakomati, Sameer Pimparkhede, Srikanth Tamilselvam, Prince Kumar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T09:13:50Z

**Summary**: Recent work shows Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand natural language constraints for various text generation tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. While, in the code domain, there is wide usage of constraints in code format to maintain the integrity of code written in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) like JSON and YAML which are widely used for system-level programming tasks in enterprises. Given that LLMs are increasingly used for system-level code tasks, evaluating if they can comprehend these code constraints is crucial. However, no work has been done to evaluate their controllability over code constraints. Hence, we introduce ConCodeEval, a first-of-its-kind benchmark having two novel tasks for code constraints across five representations. Our findings suggest that language models struggle with code constraints. Code languages that perform excellently for normal code tasks do not perform well when the same languages represent fine-grained constraints.

**Authors**: Abhijit Anand, Jurek Leonhardt, V Venktesh, Avishek Anand

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:40:59Z

**Summary**: As information retrieval systems continue to evolve, accurate evaluation and benchmarking of these systems become pivotal. Web search datasets, such as MS MARCO, primarily provide short keyword queries without accompanying intent or descriptions, posing a challenge in comprehending the underlying information need. This paper proposes an approach to augmenting such datasets to annotate informative query descriptions, with a focus on two prominent benchmark datasets: TREC-DL-21 and TREC-DL-22. Our methodology involves utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs to analyze and comprehend the implicit intent within individual queries from benchmark datasets. By extracting key semantic elements, we construct detailed and contextually rich descriptions for these queries. To validate the generated query descriptions, we employ crowdsourcing as a reliable means of obtaining diverse human perspectives on the accuracy and informativeness of the descriptions. This information can be used as an evaluation set for tasks such as ranking, query rewriting, or others.

### Reasoning AI Performance Degradation in 6G Networks with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Liming Huang, Yulei Wu, Dimitra Simeonidou

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T08:32:50Z

**Summary**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within 6G networks is poised to revolutionize connectivity, reliability, and intelligent decision-making. However, the performance of AI models in these networks is crucial, as any decline can significantly impact network efficiency and the services it supports. Understanding the root causes of performance degradation is essential for maintaining optimal network functionality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reason about AI model performance degradation in 6G networks using the Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. Our approach employs an LLM as a ''teacher'' model through zero-shot prompting to generate teaching CoT rationales, followed by a CoT ''student'' model that is fine-tuned by the generated teaching data for learning to reason about performance declines. The efficacy of this model is evaluated in a real-world scenario involving a real-time 3D rendering task with multi-Access Technologies (mATs) including WiFi, 5G, and LiFi for data transmission. Experimental results show that our approach achieves over 97% reasoning accuracy on the built test questions, confirming the validity of our collected dataset and the effectiveness of the LLM-CoT method. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of 6G networks, representing a significant advancement in the evolution of AI-native network infrastructures.

### RISSOLE: Parameter-efficient Diffusion Models via Block-wise Generation   and Retrieval-Guidance
**Authors**: Avideep Mukherjee, Soumya Banerjee, Piyush Rai, Vinay P. Namboodiri

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T20:33:49Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities. However, they also have a massive number of parameters, resulting in enormous model sizes, thus making them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constraint devices. Block-wise generation can be a promising alternative for designing compact-sized (parameter-efficient) deep generative models since the model can generate one block at a time instead of generating the whole image at once. However, block-wise generation is also considerably challenging because ensuring coherence across generated blocks can be non-trivial. To this end, we design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach and leverage the corresponding blocks of the images retrieved by the RAG module to condition the training and generation stages of a block-wise denoising diffusion model. Our conditioning schemes ensure coherence across the different blocks during training and, consequently, during generation. While we showcase our approach using the latent diffusion model (LDM) as the base model, it can be used with other variants of denoising diffusion models. We validate the solution of the coherence problem through the proposed approach by reporting substantive experiments to demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in compact model size and excellent generation quality.

### Novel-WD: Exploring acquisition of Novel World Knowledge in LLMs Using   Prefix-Tuning
**Authors**: Maxime Méloux, Christophe Cerisara

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:54:50Z

**Summary**: Teaching new information to pre-trained large language models (PLM) is a crucial but challenging task. Model adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning and parameter-efficient training have been shown to store new facts at a slow rate; continual learning is an option but is costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This work studies and quantifies how PLM may learn and remember new world knowledge facts that do not occur in their pre-training corpus, which only contains world knowledge up to a certain date. To that purpose, we first propose Novel-WD, a new dataset consisting of sentences containing novel facts extracted from recent Wikidata updates, along with two evaluation tasks in the form of causal language modeling and multiple choice questions (MCQ). We make this dataset freely available to the community, and release a procedure to later build new versions of similar datasets with up-to-date information. We also explore the use of prefix-tuning for novel information learning, and analyze how much information can be stored within a given prefix. We show that a single fact can reliably be encoded within a single prefix, and that the prefix capacity increases with its length and with the base model size.

### LAR-IQA: A Lightweight, Accurate, and Robust No-Reference Image Quality   Assessment Model
**Authors**: Nasim Jamshidi Avanaki, Abhijay Ghildiyal, Nabajeet Barman, Saman Zadtootaghaj

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:32:19Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in the field of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using deep learning techniques demonstrate high performance across multiple open-source datasets. However, such models are typically very large and complex making them not so suitable for real-world deployment, especially on resource- and battery-constrained mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose a compact, lightweight NR-IQA model that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ECCV AIM UHD-IQA challenge validation and test datasets while being also nearly 5.7 times faster than the fastest SOTA model. Our model features a dual-branch architecture, with each branch separately trained on synthetically and authentically distorted images which enhances the model's generalizability across different distortion types. To improve robustness under diverse real-world visual conditions, we additionally incorporate multiple color spaces during the training process. We also demonstrate the higher accuracy of recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for final quality regression as compared to the conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our evaluation considering various open-source datasets highlights the practical, high-accuracy, and robust performance of our proposed lightweight model.

### Causal-Guided Active Learning for Debiasing Large Language Models
**Authors**: Li Du, Zhouhao Sun, Xiao Ding, Yixuan Ma, Yang Zhao, Kaitao Qiu, Ting Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T07:30:13Z

**Summary**: Although achieving promising performance, recent analyses show that current generative large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them for generation, leading to poor generalizability and harmfulness of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the over-optimization problem, previous prior-knowledge-based debiasing methods and fine-tuning-based debiasing methods may not be suitable for current LLMs. To address this issue, we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a casual-guided active learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs itself to automatically and autonomously identify informative biased samples and induce the bias patterns. Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.

### Towards Achieving Human Parity on End-to-end Simultaneous Speech   Translation via LLM Agent
**Authors**: Shanbo Cheng, Zhichao Huang, Tom Ko, Hang Li, Ningxin Peng, Lu Xu, Qini Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:50:51Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present Cross Language Agent -- Simultaneous Interpretation, CLASI, a high-quality and human-like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters, we utilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain terminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can generate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical context, and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters, we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric, valid information proportion (VIP), which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real-world scenarios, where the speeches are often disfluent, informal, and unclear, CLASI achieves VIP of 81.3% and 78.0% for Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation directions, respectively. In contrast, state-of-the-art commercial or open-source systems only achieve 35.4% and 41.6%. On the extremely hard dataset, where other systems achieve under 13% VIP, CLASI can still achieve 70% VIP.

### SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding
**Authors**: Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T06:42:36Z

**Summary**: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.   To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.   Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

### From Text to Emotion: Unveiling the Emotion Annotation Capabilities of   LLMs
**Authors**: Minxue Niu, Mimansa Jaiswal, Emily Mower Provost

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T05:50:15Z

**Summary**: Training emotion recognition models has relied heavily on human annotated data, which present diversity, quality, and cost challenges. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT4, in automating or assisting emotion annotation. We compare GPT4 with supervised models and or humans in three aspects: agreement with human annotations, alignment with human perception, and impact on model training. We find that common metrics that use aggregated human annotations as ground truth can underestimate the performance, of GPT-4 and our human evaluation experiment reveals a consistent preference for GPT-4 annotations over humans across multiple datasets and evaluators. Further, we investigate the impact of using GPT-4 as an annotation filtering process to improve model training. Together, our findings highlight the great potential of LLMs in emotion annotation tasks and underscore the need for refined evaluation methodologies.

### Dynamic Self-Consistency: Leveraging Reasoning Paths for Efficient LLM   Sampling
**Authors**: Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Jie Chen, Sheng Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T05:14:59Z

**Summary**: Self-Consistency (SC) is a widely used method to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by sampling the LLM multiple times and outputting the most frequent solution. Despite its benefits, SC results in significant computational costs proportional to the number of samples generated. Previous early-stopping approaches, such as Early Stopping Self Consistency and Adaptive Consistency, have aimed to reduce these costs by considering output consistency, but they do not analyze the quality of the reasoning paths (RPs) themselves. To address this issue, we propose Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency (RASC), an innovative early-stopping framework that dynamically adjusts the number of sample generations by considering both the output answer and the RPs from Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. RASC assigns confidence scores sequentially to the generated samples, stops when certain criteria are met, and then employs weighted majority voting to optimize sample usage and enhance answer reliability. We comprehensively test RASC with multiple LLMs across varied QA datasets. RASC outperformed existing methods and significantly reduces sample usage by an average of 80% while maintaining or improving accuracy up to 5% compared to the original SC

### Error-controlled non-additive interaction discovery in machine learning   models
**Authors**: Winston Chen, Yifan Jiang, William Stafford Noble, Yang Young Lu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T05:13:11Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for detecting complex patterns within data, yet their "black box" nature limits their interpretability, hindering their use in critical domains like healthcare and finance. To address this challenge, interpretable ML methods have been developed to explain how features influence model predictions. However, these methods often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking the complex interactions between features that ML models are capable of capturing. Recognizing this limitation, recent efforts have aimed to extend these methods to discover feature interactions, but existing approaches struggle with robustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this study, we introduce Diamond, a novel method for trustworthy feature interaction discovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate (FDR), ensuring that the proportion of falsely discovered interactions remains low. We further address the challenges of using off-the-shelf interaction importance measures by proposing a calibration procedure that refines these measures to maintain the desired FDR. Diamond's applicability spans a wide range of ML models, including deep neural networks, tree-based models, and factorization-based models. Our empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate Diamond's utility in enabling more reliable data-driven scientific discoveries. This method represents a significant step forward in the deployment of ML models for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation.

### Safety Layers of Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security
**Authors**: Shen Li, Liuyi Yao, Lan Zhang, Yaliang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:35:59Z

**Summary**: Aligned LLMs are highly secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining this security is not well understood, further these models are vulnerable to security degradation when fine-tuned with non-malicious backdoor data or normal data. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as "safety layers." We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on this understanding, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly preserves model security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.

### Emergence of Social Norms in Generative Agent Societies: Principles and   Architecture
**Authors**: Siyue Ren, Zhiyao Cui, Ruiqi Song, Zhen Wang, Shuyue Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T04:14:45Z

**Summary**: Social norms play a crucial role in guiding agents towards understanding and adhering to standards of behavior, thus reducing social conflicts within multi-agent systems (MASs). However, current LLM-based (or generative) MASs lack the capability to be normative. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named CRSEC, to empower the emergence of social norms within generative MASs. Our architecture consists of four modules: Creation & Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. This addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within generative MASs. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach. Our project can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/sxswz213/CRSEC.

### Token-level Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Yongcheng Zeng, Guoqing Liu, Weiyu Ma, Ning Yang, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:39:57Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions. This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models. However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion. In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level. Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO incorporates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, TDPO enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling. Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO's superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity. Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Vance0124/Token-level-Direct-Preference-Optimization.

### Tool-Assisted Agent on SQL Inspection and Refinement in Real-World   Scenarios
**Authors**: Zhongyuan Wang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie, Jaein Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:38:37Z

**Summary**: Recent Text-to-SQL methods leverage large language models (LLMs) by incorporating feedback from the database management system. While these methods effectively address execution errors in SQL queries, they struggle with database mismatches -- errors that do not trigger execution exceptions. Database mismatches include issues such as condition mismatches and stricter constraint mismatches, both of which are more prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a tool-assisted agent framework for SQL inspection and refinement, equipping the LLM-based agent with two specialized tools: a retriever and a detector, designed to diagnose and correct SQL queries with database mismatches. These tools enhance the capability of LLMs to handle real-world queries more effectively. We also introduce Spider-Mismatch, a new dataset specifically constructed to reflect the condition mismatch problems encountered in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest performance on the averaged results of the Spider and Spider-Realistic datasets in few-shot settings, and it significantly outperforms baseline methods on the more realistic dataset, Spider-Mismatch.

### AdaptVision: Dynamic Input Scaling in MLLMs for Versatile Scene   Understanding
**Authors**: Yonghui Wang, Wengang Zhou, Hao Feng, Houqiang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:16:49Z

**Summary**: Over the past few years, the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has captured the wide interest of researchers, leading to numerous innovations to enhance MLLMs' comprehension. In this paper, we present AdaptVision, a multimodal large language model specifically designed to dynamically process input images at varying resolutions. We hypothesize that the requisite number of visual tokens for the model is contingent upon both the resolution and content of the input image. Generally, natural images with a lower information density can be effectively interpreted by the model using fewer visual tokens at reduced resolutions. In contrast, images containing textual content, such as documents with rich text, necessitate a higher number of visual tokens for accurate text interpretation due to their higher information density. Building on this insight, we devise a dynamic image partitioning module that adjusts the number of visual tokens according to the size and aspect ratio of images. This method mitigates distortion effects that arise from resizing images to a uniform resolution and dynamically optimizing the visual tokens input to the LLMs. Our model is capable of processing images with resolutions up to $1008\times 1008$. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves impressive performance in handling vision-language tasks in both natural and text-related scenes. The source code and dataset are now publicly available at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/AdaptVision}.

### VRSO: Visual-Centric Reconstruction for Static Object Annotation
**Authors**: Chenyao Yu, Yingfeng Cai, Jiaxin Zhang, Hui Kong, Wei Sui, Cong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T03:10:59Z

**Summary**: As a part of the perception results of intelligent driving systems, static object detection (SOD) in 3D space provides crucial cues for driving environment understanding. With the rapid deployment of deep neural networks for SOD tasks, the demand for high-quality training samples soars. The traditional, also reliable, way is manual labelling over the dense LiDAR point clouds and reference images. Though most public driving datasets adopt this strategy to provide SOD ground truth (GT), it is still expensive and time-consuming in practice. This paper introduces VRSO, a visual-centric approach for static object annotation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that the mean reprojection error from VRSO annotation is only 2.6 pixels, around four times lower than the Waymo Open Dataset labels (10.6 pixels). VRSO is distinguished in low cost, high efficiency, and high quality: (1) It recovers static objects in 3D space with only camera images as input, and (2) manual annotation is barely involved since GT for SOD tasks is generated based on an automatic reconstruction and annotation pipeline.

**Authors**: Jinghan Yao, Sam Ade Jacobs, Masahiro Tanaka, Olatunji Ruwase, Aamir Shafi, Hari Subramoni, Dhabaleswar K. Panda

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:44:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.

### MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling
**Authors**: Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bui1dMySea/MemLong

### UserSumBench: A Benchmark Framework for Evaluating User Summarization   Approaches
**Authors**: Chao Wang, Neo Wu, Lin Ning, Luyang Liu, Jun Xie, Shawn O'Banion, Bradley Green

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:56:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating user summaries from a long list of raw user activity data. These summaries capture essential user information such as preferences and interests, and therefore are invaluable for LLM-based personalization applications, such as explainable recommender systems. However, the development of new summarization techniques is hindered by the lack of ground-truth labels, the inherent subjectivity of user summaries, and human evaluation which is often costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce \UserSumBench, a benchmark framework designed to facilitate iterative development of LLM-based summarization approaches. This framework offers two key components: (1) A reference-free summary quality metric. We show that this metric is effective and aligned with human preferences across three diverse datasets (MovieLens, Yelp and Amazon Review). (2) A novel robust summarization method that leverages time-hierarchical summarizer and self-critique verifier to produce high-quality summaries while eliminating hallucination. This method serves as a strong baseline for further innovation in summarization techniques.

### MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing: Predicting Image Adjustments Utilizing   MiniGPT-4
**Authors**: Vahid Azizi, Fatemeh Koochaki

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:50:37Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available at this \href{https://github.com/VahidAz/MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing}

**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Anmol Agarwal, Nitin Kedia, Jayashree Mohan, Souvik Kundu, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:19:42Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs, which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today, these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT, TBT, Normalised Latency and TPOT). However, these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference, leading to an incomplete assessment of user-facing performance crucial for real-time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper, we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Etalon, a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity-index -- a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real-time user experience. Finally, we evaluate various existing open-source platforms and model-as-a-service offerings using Etalon, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Etalon is available at https://github.com/project-etalon/etalon.

### WhiteFox: White-Box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenyuan Yang, Yinlin Deng, Runyu Lu, Jiayi Yao, Jiawei Liu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand, Lingming Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T01:00:09Z

**Summary**: Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences. Fuzzing has been studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.   To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the generation on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations, practicing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101 bugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 fixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being incorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains.

### A longitudinal sentiment analysis of Sinophobia during COVID-19 using   large language models
**Authors**: Chen Wang, Rohitash Chandra

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:39:11Z

**Summary**: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia, particularly Sinophobia, leading to widespread discrimination against individuals of Chinese descent. Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained deep learning models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The ability of LLMs to understand and generate human-like text makes them particularly useful for analysing social media data to detect and evaluate sentiments. We present a sentiment analysis framework utilising LLMs for longitudinal sentiment analysis of the Sinophobic sentiments expressed in X (Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show a significant correlation between the spikes in Sinophobic tweets, Sinophobic sentiments and surges in COVID-19 cases, revealing that the evolution of the pandemic influenced public sentiment and the prevalence of Sinophobic discourse. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis revealed a predominant presence of negative sentiments, such as annoyance and denial, which underscores the impact of political narratives and misinformation shaping public opinion. The lack of empathetic sentiment which was present in previous studies related to COVID-19 highlights the way the political narratives in media viewed the pandemic and how it blamed the Chinese community. Our study highlights the importance of transparent communication in mitigating xenophobic sentiments during global crises.

### ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls   using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction
**Authors**: Yupeng Cao, Zhi Chen, Qingyun Pei, Nathan Jinseok Lee, K. P. Subbalakshmi, Papa Momar Ndiaye

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:13:56Z

**Summary**: In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock volatility is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, more predictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We use the pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCs and implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract more fine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level general information by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focus sentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are then fused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional analytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniques in financial analysis.

### Plausible-Parrots @ MSP2023: Enhancing Semantic Plausibility Modeling   using Entity and Event Knowledge
**Authors**: Chong Shen, Chenyue Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T23:13:45Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of injecting external knowledge to a large language model (LLM) to identify semantic plausibility of simple events. Specifically, we enhance the LLM with fine-grained entity types, event types and their definitions extracted from an external knowledge base. These knowledge are injected into our system via designed templates. We also augment the data to balance the label distribution and adapt the task setting to real world scenarios in which event mentions are expressed as natural language sentences. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the injected knowledge on modeling semantic plausibility of events. An error analysis further emphasizes the importance of identifying non-trivial entity and event types.

### Use of a Structured Knowledge Base Enhances Metadata Curation by Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Sowmya S. Sundaram, Benjamin Solomon, Avani Khatri, Anisha Laumas, Purvesh Khatri, Mark A. Musen

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T21:34:22Z

**Summary**: Metadata play a crucial role in ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of datasets. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to improve adherence to metadata standards. We conducted experiments on 200 random data records describing human samples relating to lung cancer from the NCBI BioSample repository, evaluating GPT-4's ability to suggest edits for adherence to metadata standards. We computed the adherence accuracy of field name-field value pairs through a peer review process, and we observed a marginal average improvement in adherence to the standard data dictionary from 79% to 80% (p<0.5). We then prompted GPT-4 with domain information in the form of the textual descriptions of CEDAR templates and recorded a significant improvement to 97% from 79% (p<0.01). These results indicate that, while LLMs may not be able to correct legacy metadata to ensure satisfactory adherence to standards when unaided, they do show promise for use in automated metadata curation when integrated with a structured knowledge base

### Anchored Preference Optimization and Contrastive Revisions: Addressing   Underspecification in Alignment
**Authors**: Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T20:26:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%. Our code is available at https://github.com/ContextualAI/CLAIR_and_APO.

### Robotic warehousing operations: a learn-then-optimize approach to   large-scale neighborhood search
**Authors**: Cynthia Barnhart, Alexandre Jacquillat, Alexandria Schmid

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T20:22:22Z

**Summary**: The rapid deployment of robotics technologies requires dedicated optimization algorithms to manage large fleets of autonomous agents. This paper supports robotic parts-to-picker operations in warehousing by optimizing order-workstation assignments, item-pod assignments and the schedule of order fulfillment at workstations. The model maximizes throughput, while managing human workload at the workstations and congestion in the facility. We solve it via large-scale neighborhood search, with a novel learn-then-optimize approach to subproblem generation. The algorithm relies on an offline machine learning procedure to predict objective improvements based on subproblem features, and an online optimization model to generate a new subproblem at each iteration. In collaboration with Amazon Robotics, we show that our model and algorithm generate much stronger solutions for practical problems than state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our solution enhances the utilization of robotic fleets by coordinating robotic tasks for human operators to pick multiple items at once, and by coordinating robotic routes to avoid congestion in the facility.

### LLaVA-Chef: A Multi-modal Generative Model for Food Recipes
**Authors**: Fnu Mohbat, Mohammed J. Zaki

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T20:20:49Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of online recipe sharing within a globalized context, there has been a notable surge in research towards comprehending and generating food recipes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 and LLaVA have paved the way for Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to delve deeper into various facets of food-related tasks, encompassing ingredient recognition and comprehensive recipe generation. Despite impressive performance and multi-modal adaptability of LLMs, domain-specific training remains paramount for their effective application. This work evaluates existing LLMs for recipe generation and proposes LLaVA-Chef, a novel model trained on a curated dataset of diverse recipe prompts in a multi-stage approach. First, we refine the mapping of visual food image embeddings to the language space. Second, we adapt LLaVA to the food domain by fine-tuning it on relevant recipe data. Third, we utilize diverse prompts to enhance the model's recipe comprehension. Finally, we improve the linguistic quality of generated recipes by penalizing the model with a custom loss function. LLaVA-Chef demonstrates impressive improvements over pretrained LLMs and prior works. A detailed qualitative analysis reveals that LLaVA-Chef generates more detailed recipes with precise ingredient mentions, compared to existing approaches.

### LV-UNet: A Lightweight and Vanilla Model for Medical Image Segmentation
**Authors**: Juntao Jiang, Mengmeng Wang, Huizhong Tian, Lingbo Cheng, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T20:19:10Z

**Summary**: Although the progress made by large models in computer vision, optimization challenges, the complexity of transformer models, computational limitations, and the requirements of practical applications call for simpler designs in model architecture for medical image segmentation, especially in mobile medical devices that require lightweight and deployable models with real-time performance. However, some of the current lightweight models exhibit poor robustness across different datasets, which hinders their broader adoption. This paper proposes a lightweight and vanilla model called LV-UNet, which effectively utilizes pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large models and introduces fusible modules. It can be trained using an improved deep training strategy and switched to deployment mode during inference, reducing both parameter count and computational load. Experiments are conducted on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC- ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets, achieving better performance compared to the state-of-the-art and classic models.

### Are Small Language Models Ready to Compete with Large Language Models   for Practical Applications?
**Authors**: Neelabh Sinha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T19:24:29Z

**Summary**: The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded their use in several applications. Yet, due to constraints of model size, associated cost, or proprietary restrictions, utilizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs is not always feasible. With open, smaller LMs emerging, more applications can leverage their capabilities, but selecting the right LM can be challenging as smaller LMs don't perform well universally. This work tries to bridge this gap by proposing a framework to experimentally evaluate small, open LMs in practical settings through measuring semantic correctness of outputs across three practical aspects: task types, application domains and reasoning types, using diverse prompt styles. It also conducts an in-depth comparison of 10 small, open LMs to identify best LM and prompt style depending on specific application requirement using the proposed framework. We also show that if selected appropriately, they can outperform SOTA LLMs like DeepSeek-v2, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and even compete with GPT-4o.

### AdapShare: An RL-Based Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Solution for O-RAN
**Authors**: Sneihil Gopal, David Griffith, Richard A. Rouil, Chunmei Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T18:10:36Z

**Summary**: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) initiative, characterized by open interfaces and AI/ML-capable RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), facilitates effective spectrum sharing among RANs. In this context, we introduce AdapShare, an ORAN-compatible solution leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) for intent-based spectrum management, with the primary goal of minimizing resource surpluses or deficits in RANs. By employing RL agents, AdapShare intelligently learns network demand patterns and uses them to allocate resources. We demonstrate the efficacy of AdapShare in the spectrum sharing scenario between LTE and NR networks, incorporating real-world LTE resource usage data and synthetic NR usage data to demonstrate its practical use. We use the average surplus or deficit and fairness index to measure the system's performance in various scenarios. AdapShare outperforms a quasi-static resource allocation scheme based on long-term network demand statistics, particularly when available resources are scarce or exceed the aggregate demand from the networks. Lastly, we present a high-level O-RAN compatible architecture using RL agents, which demonstrates the seamless integration of AdapShare into real-world deployment scenarios.

### VGBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Vector Graphics   Understanding and Generation
**Authors**: Bocheng Zou, Mu Cai, Jianrui Zhang, Yong Jae Lee

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:55:52Z

**Summary**: In the realm of vision models, the primary mode of representation is using pixels to rasterize the visual world. Yet this is not always the best or unique way to represent visual content, especially for designers and artists who depict the world using geometry primitives such as polygons. Vector graphics (VG), on the other hand, offer a textual representation of visual content, which can be more concise and powerful for content like cartoons, sketches and scientific figures. Recent studies have shown promising results on processing vector graphics with capable Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such works focus solely on qualitative results, understanding, or a specific type of vector graphics. We propose VGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs on handling vector graphics through diverse aspects, including (a) both visual understanding and generation, (b) evaluation of various vector graphics formats, (c) diverse question types, (d) wide range of prompting techniques, (e) under multiple LLMs and (f) comparison with VLMs on rasterized representations. Evaluating on our collected 4279 understanding and 5845 generation samples, we find that LLMs show strong capability on both aspects while exhibiting less desirable performance on low-level formats (SVG). Both data and evaluation pipeline will be open-sourced at https://vgbench.github.io.

### How Far Can Cantonese NLP Go? Benchmarking Cantonese Capabilities of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiyue Jiang, Liheng Chen, Pengan Chen, Sheng Wang, Qinghang Bao, Lingpeng Kong, Yu Li, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:54:14Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the competitive landscape in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for English and other data-rich languages. However, underrepresented languages like Cantonese, spoken by over 85 million people, face significant development gaps, which is particularly concerning given the economic significance of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and in substantial Cantonese-speaking populations in places like Singapore and North America. Despite its wide use, Cantonese has scant representation in NLP research, especially compared to other languages from similarly developed regions. To bridge these gaps, we outline current Cantonese NLP methods and introduce new benchmarks designed to evaluate LLM performance in factual generation, mathematical logic, complex reasoning, and general knowledge in Cantonese, which aim to advance open-source Cantonese LLM technology. We also propose future research directions and recommended models to enhance Cantonese LLM development.

### A compact neuromorphic system for ultra energy-efficient, on-device   robot localization
**Authors**: Adam D. Hines, Michael Milford, Tobias Fischer

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:53:00Z

**Summary**: Neuromorphic computing offers a transformative pathway to overcome the computational and energy challenges faced in deploying robotic localization and navigation systems at the edge. Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require to perform complex, long-range tasks. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity and limited scalability of bio-realistic networks. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs accurate place recognition in up to 8km of traversal using models as small as 180 KB with 44k parameters, while consuming less than 1% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems (LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SPECK(TM) chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. LENS represents the first fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale, on-device deployment, setting a new benchmark for energy efficient robotic place recognition.

### Theoretical and Methodological Framework for Studying Texts Produced by   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiří Milička

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:34:10Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the conceptual, methodological and technical challenges in studying large language models (LLMs) and the texts they produce from a quantitative linguistics perspective. It builds on a theoretical framework that distinguishes between the LLM as a substrate and the entities the model simulates. The paper advocates for a strictly non-anthropomorphic approach to models while cautiously applying methodologies used in studying human linguistic behavior to the simulated entities. While natural language processing researchers focus on the models themselves, their architecture, evaluation, and methods for improving performance, we as quantitative linguists should strive to build a robust theory concerning the characteristics of texts produced by LLMs, how they differ from human-produced texts, and the properties of simulated entities. Additionally, we should explore the potential of LLMs as an instrument for studying human culture, of which language is an integral part.

### Smaller, Weaker, Yet Better: Training LLM Reasoners via Compute-Optimal   Sampling
**Authors**: Hritik Bansal, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Vinh Q. Tran, Mehran Kazemi

**Summary**: Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners.

### VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths   Vision Computation
**Authors**: Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

### Awes, Laws, and Flaws From Today's LLM Research
**Authors**: Adrian de Wynter

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:00:24Z

**Summary**: We perform a critical examination of the scientific methodology behind contemporary large language model (LLM) research. For this we assess over 2,000 research works based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility) and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour, the use of LLMs as evaluators). We find multiple trends, such as declines in claims of emergent behaviour and ethics disclaimers; the rise of LLMs as evaluators in spite of a lack of consensus from the community about their useability; and an increase of claims of LLM reasoning abilities, typically without leveraging human evaluation. This paper underscores the need for more scrutiny and rigour by and from this field to live up to the fundamentals of a responsible scientific method that is ethical, reproducible, systematic, and open to criticism.

**Authors**: Kian Behzad, Rojin Zandi, Elaheh Motamedi, Hojjat Salehinejad, Milad Siami

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:56:40Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.

### GradBias: Unveiling Word Influence on Bias in Text-to-Image Generative   Models
**Authors**: Moreno D'Incà, Elia Peruzzo, Massimiliano Mancini, Xingqian Xu, Humphrey Shi, Nicu Sebe

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:51:07Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models has enabled high-quality image generation. As performance and accessibility increase, these models are gaining significant attraction and popularity: ensuring their fairness and safety is a priority to prevent the dissemination and perpetuation of biases. However, existing studies in bias detection focus on closed sets of predefined biases (e.g., gender, ethnicity). In this paper, we propose a general framework to identify, quantify, and explain biases in an open set setting, i.e. without requiring a predefined set. This pipeline leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases starting from a set of captions. Next, these captions are used by the target generative model for generating a set of images. Finally, Vision Question Answering (VQA) is leveraged for bias evaluation. We show two variations of this framework: OpenBias and GradBias. OpenBias detects and quantifies biases, while GradBias determines the contribution of individual prompt words on biases. OpenBias effectively detects both well-known and novel biases related to people, objects, and animals and highly aligns with existing closed-set bias detection methods and human judgment. GradBias shows that neutral words can significantly influence biases and it outperforms several baselines, including state-of-the-art foundation models.

### Quantifying Geospatial in the Common Crawl Corpus
**Authors**: Ilya Ilyankou, Meihui Wang, Stefano Cavazzi, James Haworth

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:49:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit emerging geospatial capabilities, stemming from their pre-training on vast unlabelled text datasets that are often derived from the Common Crawl (CC) corpus. However, the geospatial content within CC remains largely unexplored, impacting our understanding of LLMs' spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the prevalence of geospatial data in recent Common Crawl releases using Gemini 1.5, a powerful language model. By analyzing a sample of documents and manually revising the results, we estimate that 18.7% of web documents in CC contain geospatial information such as coordinates and addresses. We find little difference in prevalence between Enlgish- and non-English-language documents. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the nature and extent of geospatial data in CC, and lay the groundwork for future studies of geospatial biases of LLMs.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:48:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

**Authors**: Gianmario Voria, Giulia Sellitto, Carmine Ferrara, Francesco Abate, Andrea De Lucia, Filomena Ferrucci, Gemma Catolino, Fabio Palomba

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:28:43Z

**Summary**: Machine learning's widespread adoption in decision-making processes raises concerns about fairness, particularly regarding the treatment of sensitive features and potential discrimination against minorities. The software engineering community has responded by developing fairness-oriented metrics, empirical studies, and approaches. However, there remains a gap in understanding and categorizing practices for engineering fairness throughout the machine learning lifecycle. This paper presents a novel catalog of practices for addressing fairness in machine learning derived from a systematic mapping study. The study identifies and categorizes 28 practices from existing literature, mapping them onto different stages of the machine learning lifecycle. From this catalog, the authors extract actionable items and implications for both researchers and practitioners in software engineering. This work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for integrating fairness considerations into the development and deployment of machine learning systems, enhancing their reliability, accountability, and credibility.

### Entropic Distribution Matching in Supervised Fine-tuning of LLMs: Less   Overfitting and Better Diversity
**Authors**: Ziniu Li, Congliang Chen, Tian Xu, Zeyu Qin, Jiancong Xiao, Ruoyu Sun, Zhi-Quan Luo

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:21:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks. Cross Entropy (CE) loss is the de facto choice in SFT, but it often leads to overfitting and limited output diversity due to its aggressive updates to the data distribution. This paper aim to address these issues by introducing the maximum entropy principle, which favors models with flatter distributions that still effectively capture the data. Specifically, we develop a new distribution matching method called GEM, which solves reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization with an entropy regularizer.   For the SFT of Llama-3-8B models, GEM outperforms CE in several aspects. First, when applied to the UltraFeedback dataset to develop general instruction-following abilities, GEM exhibits reduced overfitting, evidenced by lower perplexity and better performance on the IFEval benchmark. Furthermore, GEM enhances output diversity, leading to performance gains of up to 7 points on math reasoning and code generation tasks using best-of-n sampling, even without domain-specific data. Second, when fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets for math reasoning and code generation, GEM also shows less overfitting and improvements of up to 10 points compared with CE.

### Iterative Graph Alignment
**Authors**: Fangyuan Yu, Hardeep Singh Arora, Matt Johnson

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:15:01Z

**Summary**: By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.

### LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate   political homophily
**Authors**: Serina Chang, Alicja Chaszczewicz, Emma Wang, Maya Josifovska, Emma Pierson, Jure Leskovec

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T15:36:52Z

**Summary**: Generating social networks is essential for many applications, such as epidemic modeling and social simulations. Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility. In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation. However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T15:12:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Copilot, are transforming software development by automating code generation and, arguably, enable rapid prototyping, support education, and boost productivity. Therefore, correctness and quality of the generated code should be on par with manually written code. To assess the current state of LLMs in generating correct code of high quality, we conducted controlled experiments with ChatGPT and Copilot: we let the LLMs generate simple algorithms in Java and Python along with the corresponding unit tests and assessed the correctness and the quality (coverage) of the generated (test) codes. We observed significant differences between the LLMs, between the languages, between algorithm and test codes, and over time. The present paper reports these results together with the experimental methods allowing repeated and comparable assessments for more algorithms, languages, and LLMs over time.

### Mitigating Exaggerated Safety in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ruchira Ray, Ruchi Bhalani

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:50:10Z

**Summary**: As the popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) grow, combining model safety with utility becomes increasingly important. The challenge is making sure that LLMs can recognize and decline dangerous prompts without sacrificing their ability to be helpful. The problem of "exaggerated safety" demonstrates how difficult this can be. To reduce excessive safety behaviours -- which was discovered to be 26.1% of safe prompts being misclassified as dangerous and refused -- we use a combination of XSTest dataset prompts as well as interactive, contextual, and few-shot prompting to examine the decision bounds of LLMs such as Llama2, Gemma Command R+, and Phi-3. We find that few-shot prompting works best for Llama2, interactive prompting works best Gemma, and contextual prompting works best for Command R+ and Phi-3. Using a combination of these prompting strategies, we are able to mitigate exaggerated safety behaviors by an overall 92.9% across all LLMs. Our work presents a multiple prompting strategies to jailbreak LLMs' decision-making processes, allowing them to navigate the tight line between refusing unsafe prompts and remaining helpful.

### Enhancing Dialogue Generation in Werewolf Game Through Situation   Analysis and Persuasion Strategies

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:49:13Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, have significantly enhanced dialogue systems, enabling them to generate more natural and fluent conversations. Despite these improvements, challenges persist, such as managing continuous dialogues, memory retention, and minimizing hallucinations. The AIWolfDial2024 addresses these challenges by employing the Werewolf Game, an incomplete information game, to test the capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive environments. This paper introduces a LLM-based Werewolf Game AI, where each role is supported by situation analysis to aid response generation. Additionally, for the werewolf role, various persuasion strategies, including logical appeal, credibility appeal, and emotional appeal, are employed to effectively persuade other players to align with its actions.

### Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Planning: Harnessing Large Language   Models for Complex Information Extraction
**Authors**: Zepeng Ding, Ruiyang Ke, Wenhao Huang, Guochao Jiang, Yanda Li, Deqing Yang, Jiaqing Liang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:48:10Z

**Summary**: Existing research on large language models (LLMs) shows that they can solve information extraction tasks through multi-step planning. However, their extraction behavior on complex sentences and tasks is unstable, emerging issues such as false positives and missing elements. We observe that decomposing complex extraction tasks and extracting them step by step can effectively improve LLMs' performance, and the extraction orders of entities significantly affect the final results of LLMs. This paper proposes a two-stage multi-step method for LLM-based information extraction and adopts the RL framework to execute the multi-step planning. We regard sequential extraction as a Markov decision process, build an LLM-based extraction environment, design a decision module to adaptively provide the optimal order for sequential entity extraction on different sentences, and utilize the DDQN algorithm to train the decision model. We also design the rewards and evaluation metrics suitable for the extraction results of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the information extraction capabilities of LLMs.

### Conan-embedding: General Text Embedding with More and Better Negative   Samples
**Authors**: Shiyu Li, Yang Tang, Shizhe Chen, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:47:37Z

**Summary**: With the growing popularity of RAG, the capabilities of embedding models are gaining increasing attention. Embedding models are primarily trained through contrastive loss learning, with negative examples being a key component. Previous work has proposed various hard negative mining strategies, but these strategies are typically employed as preprocessing steps. In this paper, we propose the conan-embedding model, which maximizes the utilization of more and higher-quality negative examples. Specifically, since the model's ability to handle preprocessed negative examples evolves during training, we propose dynamic hard negative mining method to expose the model to more challenging negative examples throughout the training process. Secondly, contrastive learning requires as many negative examples as possible but is limited by GPU memory constraints. Therefore, we use a Cross-GPU balancing Loss to provide more negative examples for embedding training and balance the batch size across multiple tasks. Moreover, we also discovered that the prompt-response pairs from LLMs can be used for embedding training. Our approach effectively enhances the capabilities of embedding models, currently ranking first on the Chinese leaderboard of Massive text embedding benchmark

### Identifying Terrain Physical Parameters from Vision -- Towards   Physical-Parameter-Aware Locomotion and Navigation
**Authors**: Jiaqi Chen, Jonas Frey, Ruyi Zhou, Takahiro Miki, Georg Martius, Marco Hutter

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:35:14Z

**Summary**: Identifying the physical properties of the surrounding environment is essential for robotic locomotion and navigation to deal with non-geometric hazards, such as slippery and deformable terrains. It would be of great benefit for robots to anticipate these extreme physical properties before contact; however, estimating environmental physical parameters from vision is still an open challenge. Animals can achieve this by using their prior experience and knowledge of what they have seen and how it felt. In this work, we propose a cross-modal self-supervised learning framework for vision-based environmental physical parameter estimation, which paves the way for future physical-property-aware locomotion and navigation. We bridge the gap between existing policies trained in simulation and identification of physical terrain parameters from vision. We propose to train a physical decoder in simulation to predict friction and stiffness from multi-modal input. The trained network allows the labeling of real-world images with physical parameters in a self-supervised manner to further train a visual network during deployment, which can densely predict the friction and stiffness from image data. We validate our physical decoder in simulation and the real world using a quadruped ANYmal robot, outperforming an existing baseline method. We show that our visual network can predict the physical properties in indoor and outdoor experiments while allowing fast adaptation to new environments.

### Can LLMs perform structured graph reasoning?
**Authors**: Palaash Agrawal, Shavak Vasania, Cheston Tan

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:05:44Z

**Summary**: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various reasoning capabilities through language-based prompts alone, particularly in unstructured task settings (tasks purely based on language semantics). However, LLMs often struggle with structured tasks, because of the inherent incompatibility of input representation. Reducing structured tasks to uni-dimensional language semantics often renders the problem trivial. Keeping the trade-off between LLM compatibility and structure complexity in mind, we design various graph reasoning tasks as a proxy to semi-structured tasks in this paper, in order to test the ability to navigate through representations beyond plain text in various LLMs. Particularly, we design 10 distinct problems of graph traversal, each representing increasing levels of complexity, and benchmark 5 different instruct-finetuned LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-2, Llama-2 and Palm-2) on the aforementioned tasks. Further, we analyse the performance of models across various settings such as varying sizes of graphs as well as different forms of k-shot prompting. We highlight various limitations, biases and properties of LLMs through this benchmarking process, such as an inverse relation to the average degrees of freedom of traversal per node in graphs, the overall negative impact of k-shot prompting on graph reasoning tasks, and a positive response bias which prevents LLMs from identifying the absence of a valid solution. Finally, we introduce a new prompting technique specially designed for graph traversal tasks (PathCompare), which demonstrates a notable increase in the performance of LLMs in comparison to standard prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

### SALSA: Speedy ASR-LLM Synchronous Aggregation
**Authors**: Ashish Mittal, Darshan Prabhu, Sunita Sarawagi, Preethi Jyothi

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T14:00:57Z

**Summary**: Harnessing pre-trained LLMs to improve ASR systems, particularly for low-resource languages, is now an emerging area of research. Existing methods range from using LLMs for ASR error correction to tightly coupled systems that replace the ASR decoder with the LLM. These approaches either increase decoding time or require expensive training of the cross-attention layers. We propose SALSA, which couples the decoder layers of the ASR to the LLM decoder, while synchronously advancing both decoders. Such coupling is performed with a simple projection of the last decoder state, and is thus significantly more training efficient than earlier approaches. A challenge of our proposed coupling is handling the mismatch between the tokenizers of the LLM and ASR systems. We handle this mismatch using cascading tokenization with respect to the LLM and ASR vocabularies. We evaluate SALSA on 8 low-resource languages in the FLEURS benchmark, yielding substantial WER reductions of up to 38%.

### Low-Cost Language Models: Survey and Performance Evaluation on Python   Code Generation
**Authors**: Jessica López Espejel, Mahaman Sanoussi Yahaya Alassan, Merieme Bouhandi, Walid Dahhane, El Hassane Ettifouri

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T13:23:15Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a popular choice for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their versatility and ability to produce high-quality results. Specifically, they are increasingly used for automatic code generation to help developers tackle repetitive coding tasks. However, LLMs' substantial computational and memory requirements often make them inaccessible to users with limited resources. This paper focuses on very low-cost models which offer a more accessible alternative to resource-intensive LLMs. We notably: (1) propose a thorough semi-manual evaluation of their performance in generating Python code, (2) introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy to improve model reasoning and code quality, and (3) propose a new dataset of 60 programming problems, with varied difficulty levels, designed to extend existing benchmarks like HumanEval and EvalPlus. Our findings show that some low-cost compatible models achieve competitive results compared to larger models like ChatGPT despite using significantly fewer resources. We will make our dataset and prompts publicly available to support further research.

### LLMs vs Established Text Augmentation Techniques for Classification:   When do the Benefits Outweight the Costs?
**Authors**: Jan Cegin, Jakub Simko, Peter Brusilovsky

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T13:01:42Z

**Summary**: The generative large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for data augmentation tasks, where text samples are LLM-paraphrased and then used for classifier fine-tuning. However, a research that would confirm a clear cost-benefit advantage of LLMs over more established augmentation methods is largely missing. To study if (and when) is the LLM-based augmentation advantageous, we compared the effects of recent LLM augmentation methods with established ones on 6 datasets, 3 classifiers and 2 fine-tuning methods. We also varied the number of seeds and collected samples to better explore the downstream model accuracy space. Finally, we performed a cost-benefit analysis and show that LLM-based methods are worthy of deployment only when very small number of seeds is used. Moreover, in many cases, established methods lead to similar or better model accuracies.

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T12:56:06Z

**Summary**: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current methods and metrics used to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation tasks. With the rapid growth in demand for automated software development, LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in the field of code generation. The paper begins by reviewing the historical development of LLMs and their applications in code generation. Next, it details various methods and metrics for assessing the code generation capabilities of LLMs, including code correctness, efficiency, readability, and evaluation methods based on expert review and user experience. The paper also evaluates the widely used benchmark datasets, identifying their limitations and proposing directions for future improvements. Specifically, the paper analyzes the performance of code generation models across different tasks by combining multiple evaluation metrics, such as code compilation/interpretation success rates, unit test pass rates, and performance and efficiency metrics, to comprehensively assess the practical application of LLMs in code generation. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges faced in evaluating LLMs in code generation, particularly how to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of evaluation methods and how to adapt to the evolving practices of software development. These analyses and discussions provide valuable insights for further optimizing and improving the application of LLMs in code generation tasks.

### IKUN for WMT24 General MT Task: LLMs Are here for Multilingual Machine   Translation
**Authors**: Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T12:25:14Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces two multilingual systems, IKUN and IKUN-C, developed for the general machine translation task in WMT24. IKUN and IKUN-C represent an open system and a constrained system, respectively, built on Llama-3-8b and Mistral-7B-v0.3. Both systems are designed to handle all 11 language directions using a single model. According to automatic evaluation metrics, IKUN-C achieved 6 first-place and 3 second-place finishes among all constrained systems, while IKUN secured 1 first-place and 2 second-place finishes across both open and constrained systems. These encouraging results suggest that large language models (LLMs) are nearing the level of proficiency required for effective multilingual machine translation. The systems are based on a two-stage approach: first, continuous pre-training on monolingual data in 10 languages, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality parallel data for 11 language directions. The primary difference between IKUN and IKUN-C lies in their monolingual pre-training strategy. IKUN-C is pre-trained using constrained monolingual data, whereas IKUN leverages monolingual data from the OSCAR dataset. In the second phase, both systems are fine-tuned on parallel data sourced from NTREX, Flores, and WMT16-23 for all 11 language pairs.

### Self-Alignment: Improving Alignment of Cultural Values in LLMs via   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Rochelle Choenni, Ekaterina Shutova

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T12:18:04Z

**Summary**: Improving the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with respect to the cultural values that they encode has become an increasingly important topic. In this work, we study whether we can exploit existing knowledge about cultural values at inference time to adjust model responses to cultural value probes. We present a simple and inexpensive method that uses a combination of in-context learning (ICL) and human survey data, and show that we can improve the alignment to cultural values across 5 models that include both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Importantly, we show that our method could prove useful in test languages other than English and can improve alignment to the cultural values that correspond to a range of culturally diverse countries.

### The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zihui Wu, Haichang Gao, Jianping He, Ping Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T11:58:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures. Our code is available at https://github.com/wooozihui/jailbreakfunction.

### Human and LLM-Based Voice Assistant Interaction: An Analytical Framework   for User Verbal and Nonverbal Behaviors
**Authors**: Szeyi Chan, Shihan Fu, Jiachen Li, Bingsheng Yao, Smit Desai, Mirjana Prpa, Dakuo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T15:45:13Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) technology has significantly enhanced the interaction experience between humans and voice assistants (VAs). This project aims to explore a user's continuous interaction with LLM-based VA (LLM-VA) during a complex task. We recruited 12 participants to interact with an LLM-VA during a cooking task, selected for its complexity and the requirement for continuous interaction. We observed that users show both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, though they know that the LLM-VA can not capture those nonverbal signals. Despite the prevalence of nonverbal behavior in human-human communication, there is no established analytical methodology or framework for exploring it in human-VA interactions. After analyzing 3 hours and 39 minutes of video recordings, we developed an analytical framework with three dimensions: 1) behavior characteristics, including both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, 2) interaction stages--exploration, conflict, and integration--that illustrate the progression of user interactions, and 3) stage transition throughout the task. This analytical framework identifies key verbal and nonverbal behaviors that provide a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing human and LLM-VA interactions.

### Instruction-tuned Large Language Models for Machine Translation in the   Medical Domain
**Authors**: Miguel Rios

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T11:05:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results on machine translation for high resource language pairs and domains. However, in specialised domains (e.g. medical) LLMs have shown lower performance compared to standard neural machine translation models. The consistency in the machine translation of terminology is crucial for users, researchers, and translators in specialised domains. In this study, we compare the performance between baseline LLMs and instruction-tuned LLMs in the medical domain. In addition, we introduce terminology from specialised medical dictionaries into the instruction formatted datasets for fine-tuning LLMs. The instruction-tuned LLMs significantly outperform the baseline models with automatic metrics.

**Authors**: Mohan Li, Cong-Thanh Do, Simon Keizer, Youmna Farag, Svetlana Stoyanchev, Rama Doddipatla

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T10:31:52Z

**Summary**: Speech large language models (speech-LLMs) integrate speech and text-based foundation models to provide a unified framework for handling a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce WHISMA, a speech-LLM tailored for spoken language understanding (SLU) that demonstrates robust performance in various zero-shot settings. WHISMA combines the speech encoder from Whisper with the Llama-3 LLM, and is fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient manner on a comprehensive collection of SLU-related datasets. Our experiments show that WHISMA significantly improves the zero-shot slot filling performance on the SLURP benchmark, achieving a relative gain of 26.6% compared to the current state-of-the-art model. Furthermore, to evaluate WHISMA's generalisation capabilities to unseen domains, we develop a new task-agnostic benchmark named SLU-GLUE. The evaluation results indicate that WHISMA outperforms an existing speech-LLM (Qwen-Audio) with a relative gain of 33.0%.

### UAV's Rotor Micro-Doppler Feature Extraction Using Integrated Sensing   and Communication Signal: Algorithm Design and Testbed Evaluation
**Authors**: Jiachen Wei, Dingyou Ma, Feiyang He, Qixun Zhang, Zhiyong Feng, Zhengfeng Liu, Taohong Liang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T10:21:02Z

**Summary**: With the rapid application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban areas, the identification and tracking of hovering UAVs have become critical challenges, significantly impacting the safety of aircraft take-off and landing operations. As a promising technology for 6G mobile systems, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can be used to detect high-mobility UAVs with a low deployment cost. The micro-Doppler signals from UAV rotors can be leveraged to address the detection of low-mobility and hovering UAVs using ISAC signals. However, determining whether the frame structure of the ISAC system can be used to identify UAVs, and how to accurately capture the weak rotor micro-Doppler signals of UAVs in complex environments, remain two challenging problems. This paper first proposes a novel frame structure for UAV micro-Doppler extraction and the representation of UAV micro-Doppler signals within the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, to address complex environments and the interference caused by UAV body vibrations, the rotor micro-Doppler null space pursuit (rmD-NSP) algorithm and the feature extraction algorithm synchroextracting transform (SET) are designed to effectively separate UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals and enhance their features in the spectrogram. Finally, both simulation and hardware testbed demonstrate that the proposed rmD-NSP algorithm enables the ISAC base station (BS) to accurately and completely extract UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals. Within a 0.1s observation period, ISAC BS successfully captures eight rotations of the DJI M300 RTK UAV's rotor in urban environments. Compared to the existing AM-FM NSP and NSP signal decomposition algorithms, the integrity of the rotor micro-Doppler features is improved by 60%.

### A Preference-driven Paradigm for Enhanced Translation with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Dawei Zhu, Sony Trenous, Xiaoyu Shen, Dietrich Klakow, Bill Byrne, Eva Hasler

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T10:10:55Z

**Summary**: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can achieve remarkable translation performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using only a small amount of parallel data. However, SFT simply instructs the model to imitate the reference translations at the token level, making it vulnerable to the noise present in the references. Hence, the assistance from SFT often reaches a plateau once the LLMs have achieved a certain level of translation capability, and further increasing the size of parallel data does not provide additional benefits. To overcome this plateau associated with imitation-based SFT, we propose a preference-based approach built upon the Plackett-Luce model. The objective is to steer LLMs towards a more nuanced understanding of translation preferences from a holistic view, while also being more resilient in the absence of gold translations. We further build a dataset named MAPLE to verify the effectiveness of our approach, which includes multiple translations of varying quality for each source sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in "breaking the plateau" across diverse LLMs and test settings. Our in-depth analysis underscores the pivotal role of diverse translations and accurate preference scores in the success of our approach.

### Outside the Comfort Zone: Analysing LLM Capabilities in Software   Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Yuejun Guo, Constantinos Patsakis, Qiang Hu, Qiang Tang, Fran Casino

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T10:00:57Z

**Summary**: The significant increase in software production driven by automation and faster development lifecycles has resulted in a corresponding surge in software vulnerabilities. In parallel, the evolving landscape of software vulnerability detection, highlighting the shift from traditional methods to machine learning and large language models (LLMs), provides massive opportunities at the cost of resource-demanding computations. This paper thoroughly analyses LLMs' capabilities in detecting vulnerabilities within source code by testing models beyond their usual applications to study their potential in cybersecurity tasks. We evaluate the performance of six open-source models that are specifically trained for vulnerability detection against six general-purpose LLMs, three of which were further fine-tuned on a dataset that we compiled. Our dataset, alongside five state-of-the-art benchmark datasets, were used to create a pipeline to leverage a binary classification task, namely classifying code into vulnerable and non-vulnerable. The findings highlight significant variations in classification accuracy across benchmarks, revealing the critical influence of fine-tuning in enhancing the detection capabilities of small LLMs over their larger counterparts, yet only in the specific scenarios in which they were trained. Further experiments and analysis also underscore the issues with current benchmark datasets, particularly around mislabeling and their impact on model training and performance, which raises concerns about the current state of practice. We also discuss the road ahead in the field suggesting strategies for improved model training and dataset curation.

### Improving Ontology Requirements Engineering with OntoChat and   Participatory Prompting
**Authors**: Yihang Zhao, Bohui Zhang, Xi Hu, Shuyin Ouyang, Jongmo Kim, Nitisha Jain, Jacopo de Berardinis, Albert Meroño-Peñuela, Elena Simperl

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T09:34:48Z

**Summary**: Past ontology requirements engineering (ORE) has primarily relied on manual methods, such as interviews and collaborative forums, to gather user requirements from domain experts, especially in large projects. Current OntoChat offers a framework for ORE that utilises large language models (LLMs) to streamline the process through four key functions: user story creation, competency question (CQ) extraction, CQ filtration and analysis, and ontology testing support. In OntoChat, users are expected to prompt the chatbot to generate user stories. However, preliminary evaluations revealed that they struggle to do this effectively. To address this issue, we experimented with a research method called participatory prompting, which involves researcher-mediated interactions to help users without deep knowledge of LLMs use the chatbot more effectively. This participatory prompting user study produces pre-defined prompt templates based on user queries, focusing on creating and refining personas, goals, scenarios, sample data, and data resources for user stories. These refined user stories will subsequently be converted into CQs.

### Helmsman of the Masses? Evaluate the Opinion Leadership of Large   Language Models in the Werewolf Game
**Authors**: Silin Du, Xiaowei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T08:49:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited memorable strategic behaviors in social deductive games. However, the significance of opinion leadership exhibited by LLM-based agents has been largely overlooked, which is crucial for practical applications in multi-agent and human-AI interaction settings. Opinion leaders are individuals who have a noticeable impact on the beliefs and behaviors of others within a social group. In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game includes the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales. In addition, we collect a Werewolf question-answering dataset (WWQA) to assess and enhance LLM's grasp of the game rules, and we also incorporate human participants for further analysis. The results suggest that the Werewolf game is a suitable test bed to evaluate the opinion leadership of LLMs, and few LLMs possess the capacity for opinion leadership.

### LRP4RAG: Detecting Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via   Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
**Authors**: Haichuan Hu, Yuhan Sun, Quanjun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T08:45:30Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a primary technique for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, incomplete knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding can still mislead LLMs to produce irrelevant or even contradictory responses, which means hallucinations persist in RAG. In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations in RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the input and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and resampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into multiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for detecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.

### The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Nucleus Sampling on Mitigating Text   Memorization
**Authors**: Luka Borec, Philipp Sadler, David Schlangen

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T08:30:33Z

**Summary**: This work analyses the text memorization behavior of large language models (LLMs) when subjected to nucleus sampling. Stochastic decoding methods like nucleus sampling are typically applied to overcome issues such as monotonous and repetitive text generation, which are often observed with maximization-based decoding techniques. We hypothesize that nucleus sampling might also reduce the occurrence of memorization patterns, because it could lead to the selection of tokens outside the memorized sequence. To test this hypothesis we create a diagnostic dataset with a known distribution of duplicates that gives us some control over the likelihood of memorization of certain parts of the training data. Our analysis of two GPT-Neo models fine-tuned on this dataset interestingly shows that (i) an increase of the nucleus size reduces memorization only modestly, and (ii) even when models do not engage in "hard" memorization -- a verbatim reproduction of training samples -- they may still display "soft" memorization whereby they generate outputs that echo the training data but without a complete one-by-one resemblance.

### PsychoGAT: A Novel Psychological Measurement Paradigm through   Interactive Fiction Games with LLM Agents
**Authors**: Qisen Yang, Zekun Wang, Honghui Chen, Shenzhi Wang, Yifan Pu, Xin Gao, Wenhao Huang, Shiji Song, Gao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T08:27:27Z

**Summary**: Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility. While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability. In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.

### Internal Consistency and Self-Feedback in Large Language Models: A   Survey
**Authors**: Xun Liang, Shichao Song, Zifan Zheng, Hanyu Wang, Qingchen Yu, Xunkai Li, Rong-Hua Li, Peng Cheng, Zhonghao Wang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T08:24:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit deficient reasoning or generate hallucinations. To address these, studies prefixed with "Self-" such as Self-Consistency, Self-Improve, and Self-Refine have been initiated. They share a commonality: involving LLMs evaluating and updating themselves. Nonetheless, these efforts lack a unified perspective on summarization, as existing surveys predominantly focus on categorization.   In this paper, we summarize a theoretical framework, Internal Consistency, offering explanations for reasoning deficiencies and hallucinations. Internal Consistency refers to the consistency in expressions among LLMs' latent, decoding, or response layers based on sampling methodologies. Then, we introduce another effective theoretical framework capable of mining Internal Consistency, named Self-Feedback. This framework consists of two modules: Self-Evaluation and Self-Update. The former captures Internal Consistency Signals, while the latter leverages the signals to enhance either the model's response or the model itself. This framework has been employed in numerous studies.   We systematically classify these studies by tasks and lines of work; summarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks; and delve into the concern, "Does Self-Feedback Really Work?" We also propose several critical viewpoints, including the "Hourglass Evolution of Internal Consistency", "Consistency Is (Almost) Correctness" hypothesis, and "The Paradox of Latent and Explicit Reasoning". The relevant resources are open-sourced at https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/ICSFSurvey.

### Critic-CoT: Boosting the reasoning abilities of large language model via   Chain-of-thoughts Critic
**Authors**: Xin Zheng, Jie Lou, Boxi Cao, Xueru Wen, Yuqiu Ji, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T08:02:09Z

**Summary**: Self-critic has become an important mechanism for enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. However, current approaches mainly involve basic prompts without further training, which tend to be over-simplified, leading to limited accuracy.Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth investigation of the relationship between LLM's ability to criticism and its task-solving performance.To address these issues, we propose Critic-CoT, a novel framework that pushes LLMs toward System-2-like critic capability, via step-wise CoT reasoning format and distant-supervision data construction, without the need for human annotation. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH show that via filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement, our enhanced model boosts task-solving performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Further, we find that training on critique and refinement alone improves the generation. We hope our work could shed light on future research on improving the reasoning and critic ability of LLMs.
