**Authors**: Guanzheng Chen, Qilong Feng, Jinjie Ni, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:59:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups. Our analyses reveal that RAPID achieves robust acceleration beyond 32K context length and demonstrates superior generation quality in real-world applications.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:29:03Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. Our code has been made available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/ThinK.

### Persistent Sampling: Enhancing the Efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Minas Karamanis, Uroš Seljak

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:15:38Z

**Summary**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.

**Authors**: Yifu Ding, Wentao Jiang, Shunyu Liu, Yongcheng Jing, Jinyang Guo, Yingjie Wang, Jing Zhang, Zengmao Wang, Ziwei Liu, Bo Du, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T06:39:06Z

**Summary**: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T03:22:41Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling
**Authors**: Lefan Zhang, Xiaodan Wang, Yanhua Huang, Ruiwen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T11:47:58Z

**Summary**: Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%. The code is available at https://github.com/HArmonizedSS/HASS.

### Faster Diffusion via Temporal Attention Decomposition
**Authors**: Haozhe Liu, Wentian Zhang, Jinheng Xie, Francesco Faccio, Mengmeng Xu, Tao Xiang, Mike Zheng Shou, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua, Jürgen Schmidhuber

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T10:49:33Z

**Summary**: We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.

### From Hours to Minutes: Lossless Acceleration of Ultra Long Sequence   Generation up to 100K Tokens
**Authors**: Tong Wu, Junzhe Shen, Zixia Jia, Yuxuan Wang, Zilong Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T07:10:08Z

**Summary**: Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths. Code can be found at https://github.com/bigai-nlco/TokenSwift.

### AttentionPredictor: Temporal Pattern Matters for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T02:48:22Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

### M-ANT: Efficient Low-bit Group Quantization for LLMs via Mathematically   Adaptive Numerical Type
**Authors**: Weiming Hu, Haoyan Zhang, Cong Guo, Yu Feng, Renyang Guan, Zhendong Hua, Zihan Liu, Yue Guan, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T02:16:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer applications. The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained group-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values in a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy without retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy LLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data types to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the required bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key finding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small groups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level diversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data types fail to provide.   In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type, featuring a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data distribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address these challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign the appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically generated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for real-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time quantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element (PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit. By integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the group-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated challenges. Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x) speedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM accelerator.

### AgileWatts: An Energy-Efficient CPU Core Idle-State Architecture for   Latency-Sensitive Server Applications

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T13:03:44Z

**Summary**: User-facing applications running in modern datacenters exhibit irregular request patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight latency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy conserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time from a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring the core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state by keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also remains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops) seamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power consumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level to minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further cutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost. Our evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.

### Accelerating Graph Indexing for ANNS on Modern CPUs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Wang, Haotian Wu, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yifan Zhu, Wenchao Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T11:36:43Z

**Summary**: In high-dimensional vector spaces, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key component in database and artificial intelligence infrastructures. Graph-based methods, particularly HNSW, have emerged as leading solutions among various ANNS approaches, offering an impressive trade-off between search efficiency and accuracy. Many modern vector databases utilize graph indexes as their core algorithms, benefiting from various optimizations to enhance search performance. However, the high indexing time associated with graph algorithms poses a significant challenge, especially given the increasing volume of data, query processing complexity, and dynamic index maintenance demand. This has rendered indexing time a critical performance metric for users. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the underlying causes of the low graph indexing efficiency on modern CPUs, identifying that distance computation dominates indexing time, primarily due to high memory access latency and suboptimal arithmetic operation efficiency. We demonstrate that distance comparisons during index construction can be effectively performed using compact vector codes at an appropriate compression error. Drawing from insights gained through integrating existing compact coding methods in the graph indexing process, we propose a novel compact coding strategy, named Flash, designed explicitly for graph indexing and optimized for modern CPU architectures. By minimizing random memory accesses and maximizing the utilization of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, Flash significantly enhances cache hit rates and arithmetic operations. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets, ranging from ten million to one billion vectors, exhibit that Flash achieves a speedup of 10.4$\times$ to 22.9$\times$ in index construction efficiency, while maintaining or improving search performance.

### KV-Edit: Training-Free Image Editing for Precise Background Preservation
**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Jiawei Shao, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T09:42:11Z

**Summary**: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

### KVTuner: Sensitivity-Aware Layer-wise Mixed Precision KV Cache   Quantization for Efficient and Nearly Lossless LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T03:42:15Z

**Summary**: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations are available at https://github.com/cmd2001/KVTuner.

**Authors**: Viraj Thakkar, Qi Lin, Kenanya Keandra Adriel Prasetyo, Raden Haryosatyo Wisjnunandono, Achmad Imam Kistijantoro, Reza Fuad Rachmadi, Zhichao Cao

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T19:48:48Z

**Summary**: Log-Structured Merge-tree-based Key-Value Store (LSM-KVS) is a foundational storage engine serving diverse modern workloads, systems, and applications. To suit varying use cases, LSM-KVS allows a vast configuration space that controls core parameters like compaction, flush, and cache sizes, each consuming a shared pool of CPU, Memory, and Storage resources. Navigating the LSM-KVS configuration space necessitates knowledge of the impact of each configuration on the expected workload and underlying hardware. Beyond expensive and time-intensive human-expert-based tuning, existing LSM-KVS tuning solutions focus on tuning with specific workload expectations while limited to a narrow subset of parameters.   This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems. ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS. ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads. Through detailed evaluation using RocksDB under several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14X our YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.

### MEDA: Dynamic KV Cache Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Hui Shen, Xin Wang, Che Liu, Zheda Mai, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T19:34:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long text-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their multimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths, challenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in both text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations across layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies for layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic layer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context inference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to determine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically allocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection scheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that merges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the entire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82 times faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on various multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and long-video scenarios. Our code is released at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/MEDA.

### LongSpec: Long-Context Speculative Decoding with Efficient Drafting and   Verification
**Authors**: Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:53:31Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.

### GTX: A Write-Optimized Latch-free Graph Data System with Transactional   Support -- Extended Version
**Authors**: Libin Zhou, Lu Xing, Yeasir Rayhan, Walid. G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:51:48Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces GTX, a standalone main-memory write-optimized graph data system that specializes in structural and graph property updates while enabling concurrent reads and graph analytics through ACID transactions. Recent graph systems target concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing transaction semantics. However, their performance suffers from updates with real-world temporal locality over the same vertices and edges due to vertex-centric lock contentions. GTX has an adaptive delta-chain locking protocol on top of a carefully designed latch-free graph storage. It eliminates vertex-level locking contention, and adapts to real-life workloads while maintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. GTX's transactions further support cache-friendly block level concurrency control, and cooperative group commit and garbage collection. This combination of features ensures high update throughput and provides low-latency graph analytics. Based on experimental evaluation, in addition to not sacrificing the performance of read-heavy analytical workloads, and having competitive performance similar to state-of-the-art systems, GTX has high read-write transaction throughput. For write-heavy transactional workloads, GTX achieves up to 11x better transaction throughput than the best-performing state-of-the-art system.

### Evaluating IOMMU-Based Shared Virtual Addressing for RISC-V Embedded   Heterogeneous SoCs
**Authors**: Cyril Koenig, Enrico Zelioli, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:26:22Z

**Summary**: Embedded heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoCs) rely on domain-specific hardware accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency. In particular, programmable multi-core accelerators feature a cluster of processing elements and tightly coupled scratchpad memories to balance performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In embedded systems running a general-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically addressed memory regions. This negatively impacts memory utilization and performance by requiring a copy from the virtual host address to the physical accelerator address space. Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs) overcome this limitation by allowing devices and hosts to use a shared virtual paged address space. However, resolving IO virtual addresses can be particularly costly on high-latency memory systems as it requires up to three sequential memory accesses on IOTLB miss. In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous embedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V SoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated the system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute kernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP programming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and accelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show that IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the accelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high memory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache, this IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same conditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable for such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T15:42:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM   Compression Preserve?
**Authors**: Zhenheng Tang, Xiang Liu, Qian Wang, Peijie Dong, Bingsheng He, Xiaowen Chu, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T15:39:35Z

**Summary**: Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.

### Round Attention: A Novel Round-Level Attention Mechanism to Accelerate   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T13:35:18Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.

### CodeSwift: Accelerating LLM Inference for Efficient Code Generation
**Authors**: Qianhui Zhao, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Xiaoli Lian, Qiaoyuanhe Meng, Ziqian Jiao, Zetong Zhou, Borui Zhang, Runlin Guo, Jia Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T13:30:30Z

**Summary**: Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but the autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to poor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.

### DBudgetKV: Dynamic Budget in KV Cache Compression for Ensuring Optimal   Performance
**Authors**: Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T06:33:39Z

**Summary**: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. However, these techniques often require a pre-defined cache budget; as the optimal budget varies with different input lengths and task types, it limits their practical deployment accepting open-domain instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.

### BaKlaVa -- Budgeted Allocation of KV cache for Long-context Inference
**Authors**: Ahmed Burak Gulhan, Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Murali Emani, Mahmut Kandemir, Venkatram Vishwanath

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T01:28:27Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, Key-Value (KV) caches (KV-caches) are essential for reducing time complexity. However, they result in a linear increase in GPU memory as the context length grows. While recent work explores KV-cache eviction and compression policies to reduce memory usage, they often consider uniform KV-caches across all attention heads, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce BaKlaVa, a method to allocate optimal memory for individual KV-caches across the model by estimating the importance of each KV-cache. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that not all KV-caches are equally critical for LLM performance. Using a one-time profiling approach, BaKlaVa assigns optimal memory budgets to each KV-cache. We evaluated our method on LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B models, achieving up to a 70\% compression ratio while keeping baseline performance and delivering up to an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at higher compression levels.

### Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for   Knowledge Tasks
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T19:48:12Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

**Authors**: Xidong Mu, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T16:17:34Z

**Summary**: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) empowered multi-functional 6G wireless networks are investigated. Starting with the communication functionality, various types of STARS are introduced in terms of power amplification capabilities, reciprocity features, and spatial density of elements. Then, three STARS-empowered wireless sensing architectures are proposed, namely STARS-aided monostatic sensing, STARS-enabled bistatic sensing, and sensing with target-mounted STARS, where the representative benefits and application challenges are identified. Furthermore, promising applications of STARS for computing and caching functionalities are explored to improve the computation efficiency and reduce the content delivery latency. Finally, recent standardization progress for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces is presented for motivating the employment of STARS in multi-functional 6G.

### A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear   Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing
**Authors**: Minquan Cheng, Huimei Wei, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T11:52:45Z

**Summary**: Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

### Cache Coherence Over Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Ruihong Wang, Jianguo Wang, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T03:27:01Z

**Summary**: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol , thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

### PLDR-LLMs Learn A Generalizable Tensor Operator That Can Replace Its Own   Deep Neural Net At Inference
**Authors**: Burc Gokden

**Updated**: 2025-02-22T22:32:08Z

**Summary**: We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.

### Warp-centric GPU meta-meshing and fast triangulation of billion-scale   lattice structures
**Authors**: Qiang Zou, Yunzhu Gao

**Updated**: 2025-02-22T10:31:51Z

**Summary**: Lattice structures have been widely used in applications due to their superior mechanical properties. To fabricate such structures, a geometric processing step called triangulation is often employed to transform them into the STL format before sending them to 3D printers. Because lattice structures tend to have high geometric complexity, this step usually generates a large amount of triangles, a memory and compute-intensive task. This problem manifests itself clearly through large-scale lattice structures that have millions or billions of struts. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transform a lattice structure into an intermediate model called meta-mesh before undergoing real triangulation. Compared to triangular meshes, meta-meshes are very lightweight and much less compute-demanding. The meta-mesh can also work as a base mesh reusable for conveniently and efficiently triangulating lattice structures with arbitrary resolutions. A CPU+GPU asynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate meta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU algorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric design paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data compression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced scheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch divergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the proposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously achievable.

### KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao, Shiyu Chang

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T23:34:29Z

**Summary**: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation of LLMs when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces three key components: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents, and applying mixed-data fine-tuning to enhance performance while preserving the model's original capabilities. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 90% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

### Compression Barriers for Autoregressive Transformers
**Authors**: Themistoklis Haris, Krzysztof Onak

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T21:37:52Z

**Summary**: A key limitation of autoregressive Transformers is the large memory needed at inference-time to cache all previous key-value (KV) embeddings. Prior works address this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural properties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can truly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for attention-based token generation must use $\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated so far and $d = \Omega(\log n)$ is the dimension of the KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication complexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties of projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the low-dimensional regime $d = o(\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers, that SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this bound. Further, we investigate how sparsity assumptions enable token generation in truly sublinear space, presenting impossibility results and proposing a new KV cache compression algorithm for sliding window attention when the value cache outside the window is unmasked. Finally, we analyze token generation's time complexity, using an indistinguishability argument to prove that no non-adaptive algorithm can compute attention online in sublinear time for all tokens.

### U-index: A Universal Indexing Framework for Matching Long Patterns
**Authors**: Lorraine A. K. Ayad, Gabriele Fici, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp, Grigorios Loukides, Rob Patro, Giulio Ermanno Pibiri, Solon P. Pissis

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T13:35:43Z

**Summary**: Text indexing is a fundamental and well-studied problem. Classic solutions either replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the FM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy - an index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent compressed space, but areslow in practice. The latter approaches, like the suffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.   We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra space on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are sufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in which a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the text. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the original text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us to use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index, or r-index.   We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With an extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal indexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and take a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower bound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore, these data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query time, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying candidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in practice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text). Finally, we discuss some important applications of this novel indexing paradigm to computational biology. We hypothesize that such indexes will be particularly effective when the queries are sufficiently long, and so demonstrate applications in long-read mapping.

### CoKV: Optimizing KV Cache Allocation via Cooperative Game
**Authors**: Qiheng Sun, Hongwei Zhang, Haocheng Xia, Jiayao Zhang, Jinfei Liu, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T12:03:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on various aspects of human life. However, one of the major challenges in deploying these models is the substantial memory consumption required to store key-value pairs (KV), which imposes significant resource demands. Recent research has focused on KV cache budget allocation, with several approaches proposing head-level budget distribution by evaluating the importance of individual attention heads. These methods, however, assess the importance of heads independently, overlooking their cooperative contributions within the model, which may result in a deviation from their true impact on model performance. In light of this limitation, we propose CoKV, a novel method that models the cooperation between heads in model inference as a cooperative game. By evaluating the contribution of each head within the cooperative game, CoKV can allocate the cache budget more effectively. Extensive experiments show that CoKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LongBench benchmark using LLama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B models.

### SVDq: 1.25-bit and 410x Key Cache Compression for LLM Attention
**Authors**: Hong Yankun, Li Xing, Zhen Hui-Ling, Yu Xianzhi, Liu Wulong, Yuan Mingxuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T08:55:21Z

**Summary**: For the efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), the effective compression of key-value (KV) cache is essential. Three main types of KV cache compression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization, have been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K cache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations. Since the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after only a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware quantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective allocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we prove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are much lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space. Our findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can achieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined with key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for attention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance. Notably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates that SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more efficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.

### SAAP: Spatial awareness and Association based Prefetching of Virtual   Objects in Augmented Reality at the Edge
**Authors**: Nikhil Sreekumar, Abhishek Chandra, Jon Weissman

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T04:07:00Z

**Summary**: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in large-scale online services, enabling sophisticated applications. However, the computational overhead of generating key-value (KV) caches in the prefill stage presents a major bottleneck, particularly for long-context inputs. Prefix caching mitigates this issue by storing KV caches for reuse, reducing redundant computation. Despite its advantages, prefix caching suffers from high latency due to the limited I/O bandwidth of storage devices, constraining inference efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduce Cake, a novel KV cache loading system that optimally utilizes both computational and I/O resources in parallel. Cake employs a bidirectional scheduling strategy that dynamically balances KV cache computation and loading, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Additionally, Cake incorporates an adaptive scheduling mechanism that seamlessly integrates with non-prefix caching requests, improving system throughput and adapting to fluctuating resource availabilty. Through extensive evaluations across various hardware configurations, datasets, and storage conditions, Cake achieves on average 2.6x reduction in Time to First Token (TTFT) compared to compute-only and I/O-only methods. Our findings highlight Cake as an effective and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM inference, bridging the gap between computation and I/O efficiency in large-scale AI deployments.

### More for Keys, Less for Values: Adaptive KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Mohsen Hariri, Lam Nguyen, Sixu Chen, Shaochen Zhong, Qifan Wang, Xia Hu, Xiaotian Han, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T22:24:27Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an information-aware quantization framework that adaptively compresses the key-value (KV) cache in large language models (LLMs). Although prior work has underscored the distinct roles of key and value cache during inference, our systematic analysis -- examining singular value distributions, spectral norms, and Frobenius norms -- reveals, for the first time, that key matrices consistently exhibit higher norm values and are more sensitive to quantization than value matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization errors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more bit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm values. With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates error propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory savings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that our mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even under aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for Value achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit for Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T18:59:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent   Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs
**Authors**: Tao Ji, Bin Guo, Yuanbin Wu, Qipeng Guo, Lixing Shen, Zhan Chen, Xipeng Qiu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T18:50:42Z

**Summary**: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.

### Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T16:01:34Z

**Summary**: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

**Authors**: Miao Tao, Yuanzhen Zhou, Haoran Xu, Zeyu He, Zhenyu Yang, Yuchang Zhang, Zhongling Su, Linning Xu, Zhenxiang Ma, Rong Fu, Hengjie Li, Xingcheng Zhang, Jidong Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T14:01:17Z

**Summary**: Rendering large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model faces significant challenges in achieving real-time, high-fidelity performance on consumer-grade devices. Fully realizing the potential of 3DGS in applications such as virtual reality (VR) requires addressing critical system-level challenges to support real-time, immersive experiences. We propose GS-Cache, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates 3DGS's advanced representation with a highly optimized rendering system. GS-Cache introduces a cache-centric pipeline to eliminate redundant computations, an efficiency-aware scheduler for elastic multi-GPU rendering, and optimized CUDA kernels to overcome computational bottlenecks. This synergy between 3DGS and system design enables GS-Cache to achieve up to 5.35x performance improvement, 35% latency reduction, and 42% lower GPU memory usage, supporting 2K binocular rendering at over 120 FPS with high visual quality. By bridging the gap between 3DGS's representation power and the demands of VR systems, GS-Cache establishes a scalable and efficient framework for real-time neural rendering in immersive environments.

### PLPHP: Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning for Efficient Large   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yu Meng, Kaiyuan Li, Chenran Huang, Chen Gao, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li, Xiaoping Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T12:31:31Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of multimodal tasks. However, their inference efficiency is constrained by the large number of visual tokens processed during decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning (PLPHP), a two-level fine-grained pruning method including Layer-Level Retention Rate Allocation and Head-Level Vision Token Pruning. Motivated by the Vision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically adjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger attention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with lower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies pruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same layer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and reduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of 0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance improvements in multi-image tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of fine-grained token pruning and contribute to advancing the efficiency and scalability of LVLMs. Our source code will be made publicly available.

### More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision   Trade-off in KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T12:14:49Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension separately. However, these works leaving the trade-off between these two orthogonal dimensions largely under-explored. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression.Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision,a strategy we term quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. In-depth analysis of the token-precision trade-off across key aspects demonstrates that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Furthermore, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability and effectiveness across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing KV cache compression through balanced token-precision trade-off strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhzihao/QPruningKV.

### Neural Attention Search
**Authors**: Difan Deng, Marius Lindauer

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T09:03:05Z

**Summary**: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T08:00:25Z

**Summary**: We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.

### ParallelComp: Parallel Long-Context Compressor for Length Extrapolation
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Chenyang Zhao, Chiwun Yang, Fanghua Ye, Hongxia Yang, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T07:10:43Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts is crucial for large language models (LLMs). While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization, effective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly fine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the attention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context extrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while maintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into attention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical solutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we propose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more stable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction strategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU. To further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction technique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to attention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's performance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length context, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat.

### μRL: Discovering Transient Execution Vulnerabilities Using   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: M. Caner Tol, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T06:42:03Z

**Summary**: We propose using reinforcement learning to address the challenges of discovering microarchitectural vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown, which exploit subtle interactions in modern processors. Traditional methods like random fuzzing fail to efficiently explore the vast instruction space and often miss vulnerabilities that manifest under specific conditions. To overcome this, we introduce an intelligent, feedback-driven approach using RL. Our RL agents interact with the processor, learning from real-time feedback to prioritize instruction sequences more likely to reveal vulnerabilities, significantly improving the efficiency of the discovery process.   We also demonstrate that RL systems adapt effectively to various microarchitectures, providing a scalable solution across processor generations. By automating the exploration process, we reduce the need for human intervention, enabling continuous learning that uncovers hidden vulnerabilities. Additionally, our approach detects subtle signals, such as timing anomalies or unusual cache behavior, that may indicate microarchitectural weaknesses. This proposal advances hardware security testing by introducing a more efficient, adaptive, and systematic framework for protecting modern processors.   When unleashed on Intel Skylake-X and Raptor Lake microarchitectures, our RL agent was indeed able to generate instruction sequences that cause significant observable byte leakages through transient execution without generating any $\mu$code assists, faults or interrupts. The newly identified leaky sequences stem from a variety of Intel instructions, e.g. including SERIALIZE, VERR/VERW, CLMUL, MMX-x87 transitions, LSL+RDSCP and LAR. These initial results give credence to the proposed approach.

### SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations
**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T06:07:00Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpinQuant.

**Authors**: Subhajit Chaudhury, Payel Das, Sarathkrishna Swaminathan, Georgios Kollias, Elliot Nelson, Khushbu Pahwa, Tejaswini Pedapati, Igor Melnyk, Matthew Riemer

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T05:41:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded impressive successes on many language tasks. However, efficient processing of long contexts using LLMs remains a significant challenge. We introduce \textbf{EpMAN} -- a method for processing long contexts in an \textit{episodic memory} module while \textit{holistically attending to} semantically relevant context chunks. The output of \textit{episodic attention} is then used to reweigh the decoder's self-attention to the stored KV cache of the context during training and generation. When an LLM decoder is trained using \textbf{EpMAN}, its performance on multiple challenging single-hop long-context recall and question-answering benchmarks is found to be stronger and more robust across the range from 16k to 256k tokens than baseline decoders trained with self-attention, and popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.

### NDPage: Efficient Address Translation for Near-Data Processing   Architectures via Tailored Page Table
**Authors**: Qingcai Jiang, Buxin Tu, Hong An

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T03:27:00Z

**Summary**: Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to address the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical implementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better programmability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing systems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation in VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems causes significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications generate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP systems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively analyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1) the memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot benefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are nearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an efficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of NDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates the memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the cache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two levels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a 4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a variety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core NDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the state-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\%; in 4-core and 8-core NDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\% and 30.5\%, respectively.

### RocketKV: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Two-Stage KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Payman Behnam, Yaosheng Fu, Ritchie Zhao, Po-An Tsai, Zhiding Yu, Alexey Tumanov

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T19:12:46Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy designed specifically to reduce both memory bandwidth and capacity demand of KV cache during the decode phase. RocketKV contains two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens with SnapKV++, a method improved upon SnapKV by introducing adaptive pooling size and full compatibility with grouped-query attention. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensional reductions. Combining these two stages, RocketKV achieves significant KV cache fetching bandwidth and storage savings while maintaining comparable accuracy to full KV cache attention. We show that RocketKV provides end-to-end speedup by up to 3$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction by up to 31% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA H100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks.

### Value Residual Learning
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Fares Obeid, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T17:53:11Z

**Summary**: While Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in various domains, the effectiveness of information propagation through deep networks remains a critical challenge. Standard hidden state residuals often fail to adequately preserve initial token-level information in deeper layers. This paper introduces ResFormer, a novel architecture that enhances information flow by incorporating value residual connections in addition to hidden state residuals. And a variant is the SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer's value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 13.3\% fewer model parameters and 15.4\% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### NVR: Vector Runahead on NPUs for Sparse Memory Access
**Authors**: Hui Wang, Zhengpeng Zhao, Jing Wang, Yushu Du, Yuan Cheng, Bing Guo, He Xiao, Chenhao Ma, Xiaomeng Han, Dean You, Jiapeng Guan, Ran Wei, Dawei Yang, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T16:54:58Z

**Summary**: Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount.

### The Impact of Inference Acceleration on Bias of LLMs
**Authors**: Elisabeth Kirsten, Ivan Habernal, Vedant Nanda, Muhammad Bilal Zafar

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T11:10:09Z

**Summary**: Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T10:39:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### ETS: Efficient Tree Search for Inference-Time Scaling
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Suhong Moon, Kerem Dilmen, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Nicholas Lee, Michael W. Mahoney, Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T09:30:38Z

**Summary**: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation.

### Activation-aware Probe-Query: Effective Key-Value Retrieval for   Long-Context LLMs Inference
**Authors**: Qingfa Xiao, Jiachuan Wang, Haoyang Li, Cheng Deng, Jiaqi Tang, Shuangyin Li, Yongqi Zhang, Jun Wang, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T08:50:44Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance in long-context tasks, while facing significant inference efficiency challenges with limited GPU memory. Existing solutions first proposed the sliding-window approach to accumulate a set of historical \textbf{key-value} (KV) pairs for reuse, then further improvements selectively retain its subsets at each step. However, due to the sparse attention distribution across a long context, it is hard to identify and recall relevant KV pairs, as the attention is distracted by massive candidate pairs. Additionally, we found it promising to select representative tokens as probe-Query in each sliding window to effectively represent the entire context, which is an approach overlooked by existing methods. Thus, we propose \textbf{ActQKV}, a training-free, \textbf{Act}ivation-aware approach that dynamically determines probe-\textbf{Q}uery and leverages it to retrieve the relevant \textbf{KV} pairs for inference. Specifically, ActQKV monitors a token-level indicator, Activation Bias, within each context window, enabling the proper construction of probe-Query for retrieval at pre-filling stage. To accurately recall the relevant KV pairs and minimize the irrelevant ones, we design a dynamic KV cut-off mechanism guided by information density across layers at the decoding stage. Experiments on the Long-Bench and $\infty$ Benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance with competitive inference quality and resource efficiency.

### FairKV: Balancing Per-Head KV Cache for Fast Multi-GPU Inference
**Authors**: Bingzhe Zhao, Ke Cheng, Aomufei Yuan, Yuxuan Tian, Ruiguang Zhong, Chengchen Hu, Tong Yang, Lian Yu

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T06:14:27Z

**Summary**: KV cache techniques in Transformer models aim to reduce redundant computations at the expense of substantially increased memory usage, making KV cache compression an important and popular research topic. Recently, state-of-the-art KV cache compression methods implement imbalanced, per-head allocation algorithms that dynamically adjust the KV cache budget for each attention head, achieving excellent performance in single-GPU scenarios. However, we observe that such imbalanced compression leads to significant load imbalance when deploying multi-GPU inference, as some GPUs become overburdened while others remain underutilized. In this paper, we propose FairKV, a method designed to ensure fair memory usage among attention heads in systems employing imbalanced KV cache compression. The core technique of FairKV is Fair-Copying, which replicates a small subset of memory-intensive attention heads across GPUs using data parallelism to mitigate load imbalance. Our experiments on popular models, including LLaMA 70b and Mistral 24b model, demonstrate that FairKV increases throughput by 1.66x compared to standard tensor parallelism inference. Our code will be released as open source upon acceptance.

### Multimodal Mamba: Decoder-only Multimodal State Space Model via   Quadratic to Linear Distillation
**Authors**: Bencheng Liao, Hongyuan Tao, Qian Zhang, Tianheng Cheng, Yingyue Li, Haoran Yin, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-18T18:59:57Z

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face deployment challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity, growing Key-Value cache requirements, and reliance on separate vision encoders. We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings. Code and models are released at https://github.com/hustvl/mmMamba

### Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the   Limits of Embedding Space Capacity
**Authors**: Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail Arkhipov, Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Burtsev

**Updated**: 2025-02-18T17:08:45Z

**Summary**: A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches allow to reduce the amount of compute in existing language models. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.

**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Shaoxin Cui, Wen Qiu, Zhiqiang He, Zhi Liu, Xiao Zheng, Bomin Mao, Nei Kato

**Updated**: 2025-02-18T14:05:12Z

**Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly pivotal role in modern communication networks,offering flexibility and enhanced coverage for a variety of applica-tions. However, UAV networks pose significant challenges due to their dynamic and distributed nature, particularly when dealing with tasks such as power allocation, channel assignment, caching,and task offloading. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle to handle the complexity and unpredictability of these environments, leading to suboptimal performance. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be applied to solve these mathematical optimization problems in UAV communications and networking.Rather than simply introducing DRL methods, the focus is on demonstrating how these methods can be utilized to solve complex mathematical models of the underlying problems. We begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of DRL, including value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic approaches. Then,we illustrate how DRL algorithms are applied to specific UAV network tasks by discussing from problem formulations to DRL implementation. By framing UAV communication challenges as optimization problems, this survey emphasizes the practical value of DRL in dynamic and uncertain environments. We also explore the strengths of DRL in handling large-scale network scenarios and the ability to continuously adapt to changes in the environment. In addition, future research directions are outlined, highlighting the potential for DRL to further enhance UAV communications and expand its applicability to more complex,multi-agent settings.

### A$^2$ATS: Retrieval-Based KV Cache Reduction via Windowed Rotary   Position Embedding and Query-Aware Vector Quantization
**Authors**: Junhui He, Junna Xing, Nan Wang, Rui Xu, Shangyu Wu, Peng Zhou, Qiang Liu, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-18T09:11:51Z

**Summary**: Long context large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient serving due to the large memory footprint and high access overhead of KV cache. Retrieval-based KV cache reduction methods can mitigate these challenges, typically by offloading the complete KV cache to CPU and retrieving necessary tokens on demand during inference. However, these methods still suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy degradation and extra retrieval overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes A$^2$ATS, a novel retrieval-based KV cache reduction method. A$^2$ATS aims to obtain an accurate approximation of attention scores by applying the vector quantization technique to key states, thereby enabling efficient and precise retrieval of the top-K tokens. First, we propose Windowed Rotary Position Embedding, which decouples the positional dependency from query and key states after position embedding. Then, we propose query-aware vector quantization that optimizes the objective of attention score approximation directly. Finally, we design the heterogeneous inference architecture for KV cache offloading, enabling long context serving with larger batch sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that A$^2$ATS can achieve a lower performance degradation with similar or lower overhead compared to existing methods, thereby increasing long context serving throughput by up to $2.7 \times$.

### Value-based Proactive Caching for Sensing Data in Vehicular Networks: An   Operator's Perspective
**Authors**: Yantong Wang, Ke Liu, Hui Ji, Jiande Sun

**Updated**: 2025-02-18T07:58:29Z

**Summary**: Access to sensing data (SD) is crucial for vehicular networks to ensure safe and efficient transportation services. Given the vast volume of data involved, proactive caching required SD is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single slot. Therefore, these approaches lack scalability for scenarios involving multi-slots and are not well-suited for network operators who manage resources within a long-term cost budget. Moreover, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes may result in substantial queuing delays for SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring SD caching and allocating from an operator's perspective. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is given to estimate the significance of various caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic programming model is proposed to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

### HeadInfer: Memory-Efficient LLM Inference by Head-wise Offloading
**Authors**: Cheng Luo, Zefan Cai, Hanshi Sun, Jinqi Xiao, Bo Yuan, Wen Xiao, Junjie Hu, Jiawei Zhao, Beidi Chen, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-02-18T06:26:05Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in long context generation. Extending the context length has disproportionately shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during inference to the key-value cache (KV cache). In this paper, we propose HEADINFER, which offloads the KV cache to CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for any transformer layer on the GPU. HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise offloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the GPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we demonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while significantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the Llama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory footprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage from 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline inference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B model on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without approximation methods.

### Accurate Expert Predictions in MoE Inference via Cross-Layer Gate
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Fang, Zicong Hong, Yuegui Huang, Yufeng Lyu, Wuhui Chen, Yue Yu, Fan Yu, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-17T14:54:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.

### DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context   LLMs
**Authors**: Xiabin Zhou, Wenbin Wang, Minyan Zeng, Jiaxian Guo, Xuebo Liu, Li Shen, Min Zhang, Liang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-02-17T14:34:58Z

**Summary**: Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

### Tactic: Adaptive Sparse Attention with Clustering and Distribution   Fitting for Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Kan Zhu, Tian Tang, Qinyu Xu, Yile Gu, Zhichen Zeng, Rohan Kadekodi, Liangyu Zhao, Ang Li, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Baris Kasikci

**Updated**: 2025-02-17T08:39:43Z

**Summary**: Long-context models are essential for many applications but face inefficiencies in loading large KV caches during decoding. Prior methods enforce fixed token budgets for sparse attention, assuming a set number of tokens can approximate full attention. However, these methods overlook variations in the importance of attention across heads, layers, and contexts. To address these limitations, we propose Tactic, a sparsity-adaptive and calibration-free sparse attention mechanism that dynamically selects tokens based on their cumulative attention scores rather than a fixed token budget. By setting a target fraction of total attention scores, Tactic ensures that token selection naturally adapts to variations in attention sparsity. To efficiently approximate this selection, Tactic leverages clustering-based sorting and distribution fitting, allowing it to accurately estimate token importance with minimal computational overhead. We show that Tactic outperforms existing sparse attention algorithms, achieving superior accuracy and up to 7.29x decode attention speedup. This improvement translates to an overall 1.58x end-to-end inference speedup, making Tactic a practical and effective solution for long-context LLM inference in accuracy-sensitive applications.

### Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating   Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer
**Authors**: Euntae Choi, Sumin Song, Woosang Lim, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-02-17T08:12:34Z

**Summary**: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code will be made available at blind_review.

### Token Pruning in Multimodal Large Language Models: Are We Solving the   Right Problem?
**Authors**: Zichen Wen, Yifeng Gao, Weijia Li, Conghui He, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-17T07:05:36Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance for cross-modal understanding and generation, yet still suffer from severe inference costs. Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this problem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and then prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to significant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency gains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain unanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive random token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably identifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during token pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and duplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The ignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term development of token pruning. In this paper, we answer these questions one by one, providing insights into the design of future token pruning methods.

### Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?
**Authors**: Kun Luo, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Hongjin Qian, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-17T05:02:25Z

**Summary**: The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.

### Capitalizing on a Crisis: A Computational Analysis of all Five Million   British Firms During the Covid-19 Pandemic
**Authors**: Naomi Muggleton, Charles Rahal, Aaron Reeves

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T18:31:10Z

**Summary**: The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to business ownership in the UK which affects a generation of entrepreneurs and their employees. Nonetheless, the impact remains poorly understood. This is because research on capital accumulation has typically lacked high-quality, individualized, population-level data. We overcome these barriers to examine who benefits from economic crises through a computationally orientated lens of firm creation. Leveraging a comprehensive cache of administrative data on every UK firm and all nine million people running them, combined with probabilistic algorithms, we conduct individual-level analyses to understand who became Covid entrepreneurs. Using these techniques, we explore characteristics of entrepreneurs--such as age, gender, region, business experience, and industry--which potentially predict Covid entrepreneurship. By employing an automated time series model selection procedure to generate counterfactuals, we show that Covid entrepreneurs were typically aged 35-49 (40.4%), men (73.1%), and had previously held roles in existing firms (59.4%). For most industries, growth was disproportionately concentrated around London. It was therefore existing corporate elites who were most able to capitalize on the Covid crisis and not, as some hypothesized, young entrepreneurs who were setting up their first businesses. In this respect, the pandemic will likely impact future wealth inequalities. Our work offers methodological guidance for future policymakers during economic crises and highlights the long-term consequences for capital and wealth inequality.

### Leveraging Previous Steps: A Training-free Fast Solver for Flow   Diffusion
**Authors**: Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T16:41:43Z

**Summary**: Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

### EPIC: Efficient Position-Independent Context Caching for Serving Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Junhao Hu, Wenrui Huang, Haoyi Wang, Weidong Wang, Tiancheng Hu, Qin Zhang, Hao Feng, Xusheng Chen, Yizhou Shan, Tao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T14:50:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.

### Efficient Long-Decoding Inference with Reasoning-Aware Attention   Sparsity
**Authors**: Junhao Hu, Wenrui Huang, Weidong Wang, Zhenwen Li, Tiancheng Hu, Zhixia Liu, Xusheng Chen, Tao Xie, Yizhou Shan

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T14:28:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various domains, with recent advancements in challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, solving reasoning tasks often requires long decoding chains (of thoughts), which incur $O(N)$ time and memory consumption, where $N$ is the chain length. To mitigate $O(N)$ time and memory consumption, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose retaining only the most critical token's intermediate data (i.e., key-value cache) and discarding the rest. However, these existing algorithms struggle with the ``impossible trinity'' of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory ($L$ is the cache budget, $L \ll N$). To address this issue, in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm named RaaS that identifies and retains milestone tokens only until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time and $O(L)$ memory complexity.

### CacheFocus: Dynamic Cache Re-Positioning for Efficient   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Kun-Hui Lee, Eunhwan Park, Donghoon Han, Seung-Hoon Na

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T12:33:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across a variety of language tasks yet are constrained by limited input lengths and high computational costs. Existing approaches\textemdash such as relative positional encodings (e.g., RoPE, ALiBi) and sliding window mechanisms\textemdash partially alleviate these issues but often require additional training or suffer from performance degradation with longer inputs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CacheFocus}}, a method that enhances length normalization and reduces inference latency without any further training. Our approach leverages query-independent, offline caching to efficiently reuse a Context KV Cache Store. We address the amplification of abnormal token distributions problem by re-positioning cached keys and introducing Layer-Adaptive Cache Pruning to discard low-relevance caches during pre-filling. Additionally, our Adaptive Positional Allocation Strategy dynamically reassigns cache positions to maximize the use of the available positional encoding range. Experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that CacheFocus outperforms alternative methods even when inputs exceed the $4$K limit of the \texttt{LLaMA-2} model, emphasizing its practical effectiveness for long-context LLMs. Moreover, even with large maximum input length of \texttt{Qwen2}, the performance of CacheFocus shows that it maintains consistent performance even as the number of documents increases, effectively managing long-text generation without degradation.

### Streamlining the Collaborative Chain of Models into A Single Forward   Pass in Generation-Based Tasks
**Authors**: Yuanjie Lyu, Chao Zhang, Yuhao Chen, Yong Chen, Tong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T11:37:14Z

**Summary**: In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based frameworks, the "Chain of Models" approach is widely used, where multiple specialized models work sequentially on distinct sub-tasks. This approach is effective but increases resource demands as each model must be deployed separately. Recent advancements attempt to address this by applying prompt tuning, which allows a shared base model to adapt to multiple tasks with minimal parameter changes. However, a key challenge remains: intermediate outputs, passed between models as plain text, require recomputation of hidden states (i.e., Key and Value (KV) states in Transformers) during inference. In this paper, we introduce FTHSS, a novel prompt-tuning method that enables models to share KV hidden states, eliminating redundant forward passes and reducing KV cache storage. By modifying input and attention masks during training, FTHSS allows models to effectively utilize KV hidden states from prior models in both single- and multi-round scenarios. Empirical results on four tasks show that FTHSS matches the performance of traditional model chains while improving inference efficiency.

### Enabling Efficient Transaction Processing on CXL-Based Memory Sharing
**Authors**: Zhao Wang, Yiqi Chen, Cong Li, Dimin Niu, Tianchan Guan, Zhaoyang Du, Xingda Wei, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-02-16T09:08:36Z

**Summary**: Transaction processing systems are the crux for modern data-center applications, yet current multi-node systems are slow due to network overheads. This paper advocates for Compute Express Link (CXL) as a network alternative, which enables low-latency and cache-coherent shared memory accesses. However, directly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due to the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL challenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system that implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely coherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is empowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively achieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that CtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and achieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing architectures across universal transaction processing policies.

### DiskGNN: Bridging I/O Efficiency and Model Accuracy for Out-of-Core GNN   Training
**Authors**: Renjie Liu, Yichuan Wang, Xiao Yan, Haitian Jiang, Zhenkun Cai, Minjie Wang, Bo Tang, Jinyang Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-15T23:54:38Z

**Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are machine learning models specialized for graph data and widely used in many applications. To train GNNs on large graphs that exceed CPU memory, several systems store data on disk and conduct out-of-core processing. However, these systems suffer from either read amplification when reading node features that are usually smaller than a disk page or degraded model accuracy by treating the graph as disconnected partitions. To close this gap, we build a system called DiskGNN, which achieves high I/O efficiency and thus fast training without hurting model accuracy. The key technique used by DiskGNN is offline sampling, which helps decouple graph sampling from model computation. In particular, by conducting graph sampling beforehand, DiskGNN acquires the node features that will be accessed by model computation, and such information is utilized to pack the target node features contiguously on disk to avoid read amplification. Besides, \name{} also adopts designs including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory hierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to accelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk access with other operations. We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN, which are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training. The results show that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their best model accuracy.

### Speeding up Policy Simulation in Supply Chain RL
**Authors**: Vivek Farias, Joren Gijsbrechts, Aryan Khojandi, Tianyi Peng, Andrew Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-15T18:09:50Z

**Summary**: Simulating a single trajectory of a dynamical system under some state-dependent policy is a core bottleneck in policy optimization (PO) algorithms. The many inherently serial policy evaluations that must be performed in a single simulation constitute the bulk of this bottleneck. In applying PO to supply chain optimization (SCO) problems, simulating a single sample path corresponding to one month of a supply chain can take several hours. We present an iterative algorithm to accelerate policy simulation, dubbed Picard Iteration. This scheme carefully assigns policy evaluation tasks to independent processes. Within an iteration, any given process evaluates the policy only on its assigned tasks while assuming a certain "cached" evaluation for other tasks; the cache is updated at the end of the iteration. Implemented on GPUs, this scheme admits batched evaluation of the policy across a single trajectory. We prove that the structure afforded by many SCO problems allows convergence in a small number of iterations independent of the horizon. We demonstrate practical speedups of 400x on large-scale SCO problems even with a single GPU, and also demonstrate practical efficacy in other RL environments.

### From 16-Bit to 1-Bit: Visual KV Cache Quantization for Memory-Efficient   Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zeliang Zhang, Yifan Zhu, Susan Liang, Zhiyuan Wang, Jiani Liu, Haiting Lin, Mingjie Zhao, Chenliang Xu, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-15T05:08:01Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, yet their computational overhead during deployment remains a critical challenge. While Key-Value (KV) caching improves inference efficiency by trading memory for computation, the growing memory footprint from storing extensive KV caches reduces throughput and limits long-term execution on devices with constrained GPU memory. Existing approaches primarily focus on dropping unimportant tokens to reduce the KV cache size, mitigating memory constraints at the cost of potential information loss. In contrast, we propose a simple yet effective visual quantization strategy that preserves all visual tokens while significantly reducing memory consumption. To achieve an extreme quantization ratio, i.e., 1-bit quantization, we propose group-specific quantization and quantile-based quantization approaches, motivated by the inherent patterns of the KV cache. Our method is plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration into various MLLMs to improve memory efficiency without architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces memory overhead while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving multimodal performance.

### Pushing up to the Limit of Memory Bandwidth and Capacity Utilization for   Efficient LLM Decoding on Embedded FPGA
**Authors**: Jindong Li, Tenglong Li, Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Qian Zhang, Yi Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-02-15T03:56:22Z

**Summary**: The extremely high computational and storage demands of large language models have excluded most edge devices, which were widely used for efficient machine learning, from being viable options. A typical edge device usually only has 4GB of memory capacity and a bandwidth of less than 20GB/s, while a large language model quantized to 4-bit precision with 7B parameters already requires 3.5GB of capacity, and its decoding process is purely bandwidth-bound. In this paper, we aim to explore these limits by proposing a hardware accelerator for large language model (LLM) inference on the Zynq-based KV260 platform, equipped with 4GB of 64-bit 2400Mbps DDR4 memory. We successfully deploy a LLaMA2-7B model, achieving a decoding speed of around 5 token/s, utilizing 93.3% of the memory capacity and reaching 85% decoding speed of the theoretical memory bandwidth limit. To fully reserve the memory capacity for model weights and key-value cache, we develop the system in a bare-metal environment without an operating system. To fully reserve the bandwidth for model weight transfers, we implement a customized dataflow with an operator fusion pipeline and propose a data arrangement format that can maximize the data transaction efficiency. This research marks the first attempt to deploy a 7B level LLM on a standalone embedded field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. It provides key insights into efficient LLM inference on embedded FPGA devices and provides guidelines for future architecture design.

### Region-Adaptive Sampling for Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Ziming Liu, Yifan Yang, Chengruidong Zhang, Yiqi Zhang, Lili Qiu, Yang You, Yuqing Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-14T18:59:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks across diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the previous step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the preceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We evaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up to 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation quality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable qualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup. Our approach makes a significant step towards more efficient diffusion transformers, enhancing their potential for real-time applications.

### PhishIntel: Toward Practical Deployment of Reference-Based Phishing   Detection
**Authors**: Yuexin Li, Hiok Kuek Tan, Qiaoran Meng, Mei Lin Lock, Tri Cao, Shumin Deng, Nay Oo, Hoon Wei Lim, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2025-02-14T17:17:20Z

**Summary**: Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) have achieved notable advancements in detection accuracy, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

### Optimal and Coordinated Voltage Control: Case Study on a 132 kV   Norwegian Grid Subsystem
**Authors**: Hugo Rodrigues de Brito, Daniel Simon Baltensperger, Kjetil Obstfelder Uhlen

**Updated**: 2025-02-14T15:14:53Z

**Summary**: This work presents a framework for dynamic performance assessment of the higher layers in the hierarchical voltage regulation scheme, with case studies applied to specific areas of the Norwegian grid. Unlike the primary (PVR) level, the secondary (SVR) and tertiary (TVR) levels are not tuned to a single device at a time, handling instead several reactive power resources available within a control zone including generator units, static VAr compensators and others. Proper SVR-TVR coordination for realistic transmission systems is a challenging topic at the core of many ongoing discussions in voltage control literature. Special focus is placed on practical considerations from the system operator perspective, since this research is also aimed at simplifying daily control centre routines. Dynamic simulation results concern a 21-bus equivalent of a 132 kV network model that accurately represents a Norwegian grid subsystem. Case studies address daily grid operation with real-life load demand and wind power generation profiles, showing that the proposed strategy is effective not only to minimize total active power losses as much as possible within system-wide limitations, but also to maintain adequate voltage profiles and reactive power flows. Findings pertaining to this work showcase the benefits of applying hierarchical voltage regulation layers as an asset to day-to-day control center management of a realistic transmission network.

### INF^2: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models   using Near-Storage Processing
**Authors**: Hongsun Jang, Siung Noh, Changmin Shin, Jaewon Jung, Jaeyong Song, Jinho Lee

**Updated**: 2025-02-14T05:19:46Z

**Summary**: The growing memory and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) for generative inference present significant challenges for practical deployment. One promising solution to address these challenges is offloading-based batched inference, which leverages host memory and disk as an extended memory hierarchy for GPUs. While the approach cost-effectively enables LLM inference, its performance is limited by substantial I/O overhead, primarily due to the large key-value (KV) cache sizes, which increase with batch size and LLM context window length.   In this paper, we introduce INFerence-INFinity (INF^2), a framework that boosts generative inference throughput using computational storage devices (CSDs). The core of INF^2 is attention-near storage, which offloads memory-intensive self-attention operations to near-storage accelerators, significantly reducing traffic through the system interconnect. We also propose delayed KV cache writeback to hide storage write latency by delaying newly generated KV cache writes until the cache reaches sufficient size in system memory. Additionally, we introduce cooperative X-cache, a technique designed to further trade off the remaining memory capacity for storage bandwidth. Our methods effectively minimize idle time for computation, improving the overall throughput.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, \thiswork has been implemented on PyTorch and evaluated on a real system. Our experiments show that INF^2 achieves up to 3.46$\times$ throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will open-source INF^2 to facilitate broader adoption.

### An Efficient Large Recommendation Model: Towards a Resource-Optimal   Scaling Law
**Authors**: Songpei Xu, Shijia Wang, Da Guo, Xianwen Guo, Qiang Xiao, Fangjian Li, Chuanjiang Luo

**Updated**: 2025-02-14T03:25:09Z

**Summary**: The pursuit of scaling up recommendation models confronts intrinsic tensions between expanding model capacity and preserving computational tractability. While prior studies have explored scaling laws for recommendation systems, their resource-intensive paradigms -- often requiring tens of thousands of A100 GPU hours -- remain impractical for most industrial applications. This work addresses a critical gap: achieving sustainable model scaling under strict computational budgets. We propose Climber, a resource-efficient recommendation framework comprising two synergistic components: the ASTRO model architecture for algorithmic innovation and the TURBO acceleration framework for engineering optimization. ASTRO (Adaptive Scalable Transformer for RecOmmendation) adopts two core innovations: (1) multi-scale sequence partitioning that reduces attention complexity from O(n^2d) to O(n^2d/Nb) via hierarchical blocks, enabling more efficient scaling with sequence length; (2) dynamic temperature modulation that adaptively adjusts attention scores for multimodal distributions arising from inherent multi-scenario and multi-behavior interactions. Complemented by TURBO (Two-stage Unified Ranking with Batched Output), a co-designed acceleration framework integrating gradient-aware feature compression and memory-efficient Key-Value caching, Climber achieves 5.15x throughput gains without performance degradation. Comprehensive offline experiments on multiple datasets validate that Climber exhibits a more ideal scaling curve. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented framework where controlled model scaling drives continuous online metric growth (12.19% overall lift) without prohibitive resource costs. Climber has been successfully deployed on Netease Cloud Music, one of China's largest music streaming platforms, serving tens of millions of users daily.

### Analysis of Robust and Secure DNS Protocols for IoT Devices
**Authors**: Abdullah Aydeger, Sanzida Hoque, Engin Zeydan, Kapal Dev

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T19:16:39Z

**Summary**: The DNS (Domain Name System) protocol has been in use since the early days of the Internet. Although DNS as a de facto networking protocol had no security considerations in its early years, there have been many security enhancements, such as DNSSec (Domain Name System Security Extensions), DoT (DNS over Transport Layer Security), DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoQ (DNS over QUIC). With all these security improvements, it is not yet clear what resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices should be used for robustness. In this paper, we investigate different DNS security approaches using an edge DNS resolver implemented as a Virtual Network Function (VNF) to replicate the impact of the protocol from an IoT perspective and compare their performances under different conditions. We present our results for cache-based and non-cached responses and evaluate the corresponding security benefits. Our results and framework can greatly help consumers, manufacturers, and the research community decide and implement their DNS protocols depending on the given dynamic network conditions and enable robust Internet access via DNS for different devices.

### NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs
**Authors**: Semyon Savkin, Eitan Porat, Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T19:11:40Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent work have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Meta's SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3). Comparisons on various LLM evaluation benchmarks also show a reduction in performance degradation induced by quantization.

### TransMLA: Multi-Head Latent Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Fanxu Meng, Zengwei Yao, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T18:07:04Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.

### Vortex: Overcoming Memory Capacity Limitations in GPU-Accelerated   Large-Scale Data Analytics
**Authors**: Yichao Yuan, Advait Iyer, Lin Ma, Nishil Talati

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T17:57:05Z

**Summary**: Despite the high computational throughput of GPUs, limited memory capacity and bandwidth-limited CPU-GPU communication via PCIe links remain significant bottlenecks for accelerating large-scale data analytics workloads. This paper introduces Vortex, a GPU-accelerated framework designed for data analytics workloads that exceed GPU memory capacity. A key aspect of our framework is an optimized IO primitive that leverages all available PCIe links in multi-GPU systems for the IO demand of a single target GPU. It routes data through other GPUs to such target GPU that handles IO-intensive analytics tasks. This approach is advantageous when other GPUs are occupied with compute-bound workloads, such as popular AI applications that typically underutilize IO resources. We also introduce a novel programming model that separates GPU kernel development from IO scheduling, reducing programmer burden and enabling GPU code reuse. Additionally, we present the design of certain important query operators and discuss a late materialization technique based on GPU's zero-copy memory access. Without caching any data in GPU memory, Vortex improves the performance of the state-of-the-art GPU baseline, Proteus, by 5.7$\times$ on average and enhances price performance by 2.5$\times$ compared to a CPU-based DuckDB baseline.

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T12:54:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

### RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Quan Wei, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi-To Wai, Yang, Zhao, Dongyeop Kang, Youngsuk Park, Mingyi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T06:44:33Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.

### Outback: Fast and Communication-efficient Index for Key-Value Store on   Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Yi Liu, Minghao Xie, Shouqian Shi, Yuanchao Xu, Heiner Litz, Chen Qian

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T05:40:28Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory systems achieve resource utilization efficiency and system scalability by distributing computation and memory resources into distinct pools of nodes. RDMA is an attractive solution to support high-throughput communication between different disaggregated resource pools. However, existing RDMA solutions face a dilemma: one-sided RDMA completely bypasses computation at memory nodes, but its communication takes multiple round trips; two-sided RDMA achieves one-round-trip communication but requires non-trivial computation for index lookups at memory nodes, which violates the principle of disaggregated memory. This work presents Outback, a novel indexing solution for key-value stores with a one-round-trip RDMA-based network that does not incur computation-heavy tasks at memory nodes. Outback is the first to utilize dynamic minimal perfect hashing and separates its index into two components: one memory-efficient and compute-heavy component at compute nodes and the other memory-heavy and compute-efficient component at memory nodes. We implement a prototype of Outback and evaluate its performance in a public cloud. The experimental results show that Outback achieves higher throughput than both the state-of-the-art one-sided RDMA and two-sided RDMA-based in-memory KVS by 1.06-5.03x, due to the unique strength of applying a separated perfect hashing index.

### InfiniteHiP: Extending Language Model Context Up to 3 Million Tokens on   a Single GPU
**Authors**: Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Jaduk Suh, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-02-13T02:52:01Z

**Summary**: In modern large language models (LLMs), handling very long context lengths presents significant challenges as it causes slower inference speeds and increased memory costs. Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to generalize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient and practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and practical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically eliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token pruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by selectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal attention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to host memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a result, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a single L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context information. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for a 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement our method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality through extensive evaluations.

### How Sparse Attention Approximates Exact Attention? Your Attention is   Naturally $n^C$-Sparse
**Authors**: Yichuan Deng, Zhao Song, Jing Xiong, Chiwun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-12T14:32:46Z

**Summary**: Sparse Attention is a technique that approximates standard attention computation with sub-quadratic complexity. This is achieved by selectively ignoring smaller entries in the attention matrix during the softmax function computation. Variations of this technique, such as pruning KV cache, sparsity-based fast attention, and Sparse Transformer, have been extensively utilized for efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) deployment. Despite its widespread use, a theoretical understanding of the conditions under which sparse attention performs on par with traditional attention remains elusive. This work aims to $\textbf{bridge this gap by examining the inherent sparsity of standard attention processes}$. Our theoretical framework reveals several brand-new key insights:   $\bullet$ Attention is $n^{C}$-sparse, implying that considering only the largest $\Omega(n^{C})$ entries out of all $n$ entries is sufficient for sparse attention to approximate the exact attention matrix with decreasing loss. Here, $n$ represents the input length and $C \in (0, 1)$ is a constant.   $\bullet$ Stable $o(\log(n))$-sparse attention, which approximates attention computation with $\log(n)$ or fewer entries, may not be feasible since the error will persist at a minimum of $O(1)$.   $\bullet$ An adaptive strategy ($\alpha \cdot n^C, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$) for the window size of efficient attention methods rather than a fixed one is guaranteed to perform more accurately and efficiently in a task for inference on flexible context lengths.

### APE: Faster and Longer Context-Augmented Generation via Adaptive   Parallel Encoding
**Authors**: Xinyu Yang, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-12T13:54:01Z

**Summary**: Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding ($\textbf{APE}$), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98% and 93% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6% and 7.9%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel. Efficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\times$ speedup by reducing 28$\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Zhongyang Li, Ziyue Li, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:59:32Z

**Summary**: In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities (e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.

### Beyond Next-Token: Next-X Prediction for Autoregressive Visual   Generation
**Authors**: Sucheng Ren, Qihang Yu, Ju He, Xiaohui Shen, Alan Yuille, Liang-Chieh Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:59:08Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) modeling, known for its next-token prediction paradigm, underpins state-of-the-art language and visual generative models. Traditionally, a ``token'' is treated as the smallest prediction unit, often a discrete symbol in language or a quantized patch in vision. However, the optimal token definition for 2D image structures remains an open question. Moreover, AR models suffer from exposure bias, where teacher forcing during training leads to error accumulation at inference. In this paper, we propose xAR, a generalized AR framework that extends the notion of a token to an entity X, which can represent an individual patch token, a cell (a $k\times k$ grouping of neighboring patches), a subsample (a non-local grouping of distant patches), a scale (coarse-to-fine resolution), or even a whole image. Additionally, we reformulate discrete token classification as \textbf{continuous entity regression}, leveraging flow-matching methods at each AR step. This approach conditions training on noisy entities instead of ground truth tokens, leading to Noisy Context Learning, which effectively alleviates exposure bias. As a result, xAR offers two key advantages: (1) it enables flexible prediction units that capture different contextual granularity and spatial structures, and (2) it mitigates exposure bias by avoiding reliance on teacher forcing. On ImageNet-256 generation benchmark, our base model, xAR-B (172M), outperforms DiT-XL/SiT-XL (675M) while achieving 20$\times$ faster inference. Meanwhile, xAR-H sets a new state-of-the-art with an FID of 1.24, running 2.2$\times$ faster than the previous best-performing model without relying on vision foundation modules (\eg, DINOv2) or advanced guidance interval sampling.

### rSPDE: tools for statistical modeling using fractional SPDEs
**Authors**: David Bolin, Alexandre B. Simas

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:57:44Z

**Summary**: The R software package rSPDE contains methods for approximating Gaussian random fields based on fractional-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). A common example of such fields are Whittle-Mat\'ern fields on bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, manifolds, or metric graphs. The package also implements various other models which are briefly introduced in this article. Besides the approximation methods, the package contains methods for simulation, prediction, and statistical inference for such models, as well as interfaces to INLA, inlabru and MetricGraph. With these interfaces, fractional-order SPDEs can be used as model components in general latent Gaussian models, for which full Bayesian inference can be performed, also for fractional models on metric graphs. This includes estimation of the smoothness parameter of the fields. This article describes the computational methods used in the package and summarizes the theoretical basis for these. The main functions of the package are introduced, and their usage is illustrated through various examples.

### Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security   Analysis
**Authors**: Jeffrey Yang Fan Chiang, Seungjae Lee, Jia-Bin Huang, Furong Huang, Yizheng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:56:26Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.

### Multi-Agent Verification: Scaling Test-Time Compute with Multiple   Verifiers
**Authors**: Shalev Lifshitz, Sheila A. McIlraith, Yilun Du

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:53:30Z

**Summary**: By utilizing more computational resources at test-time, large language models (LLMs) can improve without additional training. One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.

### PhantomWiki: On-Demand Datasets for Reasoning and Retrieval Evaluation
**Authors**: Albert Gong, Kamilė Stankevičiūtė, Chao Wan, Anmol Kabra, Raphael Thesmar, Johann Lee, Julius Klenke, Carla P. Gomes, Kilian Q. Weinberger

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:51:22Z

**Summary**: High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/kilian-group/phantom-wiki.

**Authors**: Ryan C. Barron, Maksim E. Eren, Olga M. Serafimova, Cynthia Matuszek, Boian S. Alexandrov

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:35:39Z

**Summary**: Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

### Bridging the Creativity Understanding Gap: Small-Scale Human Alignment   Enables Expert-Level Humor Ranking in LLMs
**Authors**: Kuan Lok Zhou, Jiayi Chen, Siddharth Suresh, Reuben Narad, Timothy T. Rogers, Lalit K Jain, Robert D Nowak, Bob Mankoff, Jifan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:29:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant limitations in understanding creative content, as demonstrated by Hessel et al. (2023)'s influential work on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest (NYCCC). Their study exposed a substantial gap between LLMs and humans in humor comprehension, establishing that understanding and evaluating creative content is key challenge in AI development. We revisit this challenge by decomposing humor understanding into three components and systematically improve each: enhancing visual understanding through improved annotation, utilizing LLM-generated humor reasoning and explanations, and implementing targeted alignment with human preference data. Our refined approach achieves 82.4% accuracy in caption ranking, singificantly improving upon the previous 67% benchmark and matching the performance of world-renowned human experts in this domain. Notably, while attempts to mimic subgroup preferences through various persona prompts showed minimal impact, model finetuning with crowd preferences proved remarkably effective. These findings reveal that LLM limitations in creative judgment can be effectively addressed through focused alignment to specific subgroups and individuals. Lastly, we propose the position that achieving artificial general intelligence necessitates systematic collection of human preference data across creative domains. We advocate that just as human creativity is deeply influenced by individual and cultural preferences, training LLMs with diverse human preference data may be essential for developing true creative understanding.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:22:33Z

**Summary**: Drug discovery is a critical task in biomedical natural language processing (NLP), yet explainable drug discovery remains underexplored. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in natural language understanding and generation. Leveraging LLMs for explainable drug discovery has the potential to improve downstream tasks and real-world applications. In this study, we utilize open-source drug knowledge graphs, clinical trial data, and PubMed publications to construct a comprehensive dataset for the explainable drug discovery task, named \textbf{expRxRec}. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{KEDRec-LM}, an instruction-tuned LLM which distills knowledge from rich medical knowledge corpus for drug recommendation and rationale generation. To encourage further research in this area, we will publicly release\footnote{A copy is attached with this submission} both the dataset and KEDRec-LM.

### Sparse Auto-Encoder Interprets Linguistic Features in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yi Jing, Zijun Yao, Lingxu Ran, Hongzhu Guo, Xiaozhi Wang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:16:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks that require complex linguistic abilities, such as reference disambiguation and metaphor recognition/generation. Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Previous work on linguistic mechanisms has been limited by coarse granularity, insufficient causal analysis, and a narrow focus. In this study, we present a systematic and comprehensive causal investigation using sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). We extract a wide range of linguistic features from six dimensions: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We extract, evaluate, and intervene on these features by constructing minimal contrast datasets and counterfactual sentence datasets. We introduce two indices-Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) and Feature Intervention Confidence (FIC)-to measure the ability of linguistic features to capture and control linguistic phenomena. Our results reveal inherent representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs and demonstrate the potential for controlling model outputs. This work provides strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.

### Thinking Slow, Fast: Scaling Inference Compute with Distilled Reasoners
**Authors**: Daniele Paliotta, Junxiong Wang, Matteo Pagliardini, Kevin Y. Li, Aviv Bick, J. Zico Kolter, Albert Gu, François Fleuret, Tri Dao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:08:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements have demonstrated that the performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly enhanced by scaling computational resources at test time. A common strategy involves generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories and aggregating their outputs through various selection mechanisms. This raises a fundamental question: can models with lower complexity leverage their superior generation throughput to outperform similarly sized Transformers for a fixed computational budget? To address this question and overcome the lack of strong subquadratic reasoners, we distill pure and hybrid Mamba models from pretrained Transformers. Trained on only 8 billion tokens, our distilled models show strong performance and scaling on mathematical reasoning datasets while being much faster at inference for large batches and long sequences. Despite the zero-shot performance hit due to distillation, both pure and hybrid Mamba models can scale their coverage and accuracy performance past their Transformer teacher models under fixed time budgets, opening a new direction for scaling inference compute.

**Summary**: Clinical decision-making depends on expert reasoning, which is guided by standardized, evidence-based guidelines. However, translating these guidelines into automated clinical decision support systems risks inaccuracy and importantly, loss of nuance. We share an application architecture, the Large Language Expert (LLE), that combines the flexibility and power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the interpretability, explainability, and reliability of Expert Systems. LLMs help address key challenges of Expert Systems, such as integrating and codifying knowledge, and data normalization. Conversely, an Expert System-like approach helps overcome challenges with LLMs, including hallucinations, atomic and inexpensive updates, and testability.   To highlight the power of the Large Language Expert (LLE) system, we built an LLE to assist with the workup of patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Timely initiation of cancer treatment is critical for optimal patient outcomes. However, increasing complexity in diagnostic recommendations has made it difficult for primary care physicians to ensure their patients have completed the necessary workup before their first visit with an oncologist. As with many real-world clinical tasks, these workups require the analysis of unstructured health records and the application of nuanced clinical decision logic. In this study, we describe the design & evaluation of an LLE system built to rapidly identify and suggest the correct diagnostic workup. The system demonstrated a high degree of clinical-level accuracy (>95%) and effectively addressed gaps identified in real-world data from breast and colon cancer patients at a large academic center.

### Long-Context Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Guanzheng Chen, Qilong Feng, Jinjie Ni, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:59:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups. Our analyses reveal that RAPID achieves robust acceleration beyond 32K context length and demonstrates superior generation quality in real-world applications.

### Logicbreaks: A Framework for Understanding Subversion of Rule-based   Inference
**Authors**: Anton Xue, Avishree Khare, Rajeev Alur, Surbhi Goel, Eric Wong

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:49:33Z

**Summary**: We study how to subvert large language models (LLMs) from following prompt-specified rules. We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.

### ACCORD: Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource   Design for 5G/NextG Machine-centric Applications
**Authors**: Azuka Chiejina, Subhramoy Mohanti, Vijay K. Shah

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:45:20Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in AI and edge computing have accelerated the development of machine-centric applications (MCAs), such as smart surveillance systems. In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions. (2) Cross-layer Network Parameter Configuration: Utilizing a DRL approach, this component leverages the contextual information to optimize network configuration parameters across various layers, including PHY, MAC, and RLC, as well as the application layer, to meet the desired QoS requirement in real-time. Extensive evaluation with the 3GPP-compliant MATLAB 5G toolbox demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed ACCORD framework.

### FlexVAR: Flexible Visual Autoregressive Modeling without Residual   Prediction
**Authors**: Siyu Jiao, Gengwei Zhang, Yinlong Qian, Jiancheng Huang, Yao Zhao, Humphrey Shi, Lin Ma, Yunchao Wei, Zequn Jie

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:39:17Z

**Summary**: This work challenges the residual prediction paradigm in visual autoregressive modeling and presents FlexVAR, a new Flexible Visual AutoRegressive image generation paradigm. FlexVAR facilitates autoregressive learning with ground-truth prediction, enabling each step to independently produce plausible images. This simple, intuitive approach swiftly learns visual distributions and makes the generation process more flexible and adaptable. Trained solely on low-resolution images ($\leq$ 256px), FlexVAR can: (1) Generate images of various resolutions and aspect ratios, even exceeding the resolution of the training images. (2) Support various image-to-image tasks, including image refinement, in/out-painting, and image expansion. (3) Adapt to various autoregressive steps, allowing for faster inference with fewer steps or enhancing image quality with more steps. Our 1.0B model outperforms its VAR counterpart on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. Moreover, when zero-shot transfer the image generation process with 13 steps, the performance further improves to 2.08 FID, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive models AiM/VAR by 0.25/0.28 FID and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.52/0.19 FID, respectively. When transferring our 1.0B model to the ImageNet 512$\times$512 benchmark in a zero-shot manner, FlexVAR achieves competitive results compared to the VAR 2.3B model, which is a fully supervised model trained at 512$\times$512 resolution.

### Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First   Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach
**Authors**: Lennox S. Keeble, Alejandro Cárdenas-Avendaño, Daniel C. M. Palumbo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:38:38Z

**Summary**: Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which, given an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin value. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the first photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular brightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is restricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape asymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high spins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise sources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the $n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a robust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. In low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from the n=0 image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry estimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged images, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the resulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to synthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon ring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:35:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements have positioned AI, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), as transformative tools for scientific research, capable of addressing complex tasks that require reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Their exceptional capabilities suggest their potential as scientific research assistants but also highlight the need for holistic, rigorous, and domain-specific evaluation to assess effectiveness in real-world scientific applications. This paper describes a multifaceted methodology for Evaluating AI models as scientific Research Assistants (EAIRA) developed at Argonne National Laboratory. This methodology incorporates four primary classes of evaluations. 1) Multiple Choice Questions to assess factual recall; 2) Open Response to evaluate advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills; 3) Lab-Style Experiments involving detailed analysis of capabilities as research assistants in controlled environments; and 4) Field-Style Experiments to capture researcher-LLM interactions at scale in a wide range of scientific domains and applications. These complementary methods enable a comprehensive analysis of LLM strengths and weaknesses with respect to their scientific knowledge, reasoning abilities, and adaptability. Recognizing the rapid pace of LLM advancements, we designed the methodology to evolve and adapt so as to ensure its continued relevance and applicability. This paper describes the methodology state at the end of February 2025. Although developed within a subset of scientific domains, the methodology is designed to be generalizable to a wide range of scientific domains.

### Mobius: Text to Seamless Looping Video Generation via Latent Shift
**Authors**: Xiuli Bi, Jianfei Yuan, Bo Liu, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Chi-Man Pun, Bin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:33:51Z

**Summary**: We present Mobius, a novel method to generate seamlessly looping videos from text descriptions directly without any user annotations, thereby creating new visual materials for the multi-media presentation. Our method repurposes the pre-trained video latent diffusion model for generating looping videos from text prompts without any training. During inference, we first construct a latent cycle by connecting the starting and ending noise of the videos. Given that the temporal consistency can be maintained by the context of the video diffusion model, we perform multi-frame latent denoising by gradually shifting the first-frame latent to the end in each step. As a result, the denoising context varies in each step while maintaining consistency throughout the inference process. Moreover, the latent cycle in our method can be of any length. This extends our latent-shifting approach to generate seamless looping videos beyond the scope of the video diffusion model's context. Unlike previous cinemagraphs, the proposed method does not require an image as appearance, which will restrict the motions of the generated results. Instead, our method can produce more dynamic motion and better visual quality. We conduct multiple experiments and comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its efficacy in different scenarios. All the code will be made available.

### An exploration of features to improve the generalisability of fake news   detection models
**Authors**: Nathaniel Hoy, Theodora Koulouri

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:26:56Z

**Summary**: Fake news poses global risks by influencing elections and spreading misinformation, making detection critical. Existing NLP and supervised Machine Learning methods perform well under cross-validation but struggle to generalise across datasets, even within the same domain. This issue stems from coarsely labelled training data, where articles are labelled based on their publisher, introducing biases that token-based models like TF-IDF and BERT are sensitive to. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, their application in fake news detection remains limited. This study demonstrates that meaningful features can still be extracted from coarsely labelled data to improve real-world robustness. Stylistic features-lexical, syntactic, and semantic-are explored due to their reduced sensitivity to dataset biases. Additionally, novel social-monetisation features are introduced, capturing economic incentives behind fake news, such as advertisements, external links, and social media elements. The study trains on the coarsely labelled NELA 2020-21 dataset and evaluates using the manually labelled Facebook URLs dataset, a gold standard for generalisability. Results highlight the limitations of token-based models trained on biased data and contribute to the scarce evidence on LLMs like LLaMa in this field. Findings indicate that stylistic and social-monetisation features offer more generalisable predictions than token-based methods and LLMs. Statistical and permutation feature importance analyses further reveal their potential to enhance performance and mitigate dataset biases, providing a path forward for improving fake news detection.

### LeanProgress: Guiding Search for Neural Theorem Proving via Proof   Progress Prediction
**Authors**: Suozhi Huang, Peiyang Song, Robert Joseph George, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:26:11Z

**Summary**: Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.1\% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8\% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.2\%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.

### Judge a Book by its Cover: Investigating Multi-Modal LLMs for Multi-Page   Handwritten Document Transcription
**Authors**: Benjamin Gutteridge, Matthew Thomas Jackson, Toni Kukurin, Xiaowen Dong

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:21:18Z

**Summary**: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) remains a challenging task, particularly for multi-page documents where pages share common formatting and contextual features. While modern optical character recognition (OCR) engines are proficient with printed text, their performance on handwriting is limited, often requiring costly labeled data for fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for transcribing multi-page handwritten documents in a zero-shot setting. We investigate various configurations of commercial OCR engines and MLLMs, utilizing the latter both as end-to-end transcribers and as post-processors, with and without image components. We propose a novel method, '+first page', which enhances MLLM transcription by providing the OCR output of the entire document along with just the first page image. This approach leverages shared document features without incurring the high cost of processing all images. Experiments on a multi-page version of the IAM Handwriting Database demonstrate that '+first page' improves transcription accuracy, balances cost with performance, and even enhances results on out-of-sample text by extrapolating formatting and OCR error patterns from a single page.

### BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological   Pathway Reasoning
**Authors**: Haiteng Zhao, Chang Ma, Fangzhi Xu, Lingpeng Kong, Zhi-Hong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:17:08Z

**Summary**: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:15:49Z

**Summary**: Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics and can be accessed here: https://github.com/ServiceNow/insight-bench.

### Conformal Tail Risk Control for Large Language Model Alignment
**Authors**: Catherine Yu-Chi Chen, Jingyan Shen, Zhun Deng, Lihua Lei

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:10:54Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread usage for various tasks. The prevalence of LLMs in society implores the assurance on the reliability of their performance. In particular, risk-sensitive applications demand meticulous attention to unexpectedly poor outcomes, i.e., tail events, for instance, toxic answers, humiliating language, and offensive outputs. Due to the costly nature of acquiring human annotations, general-purpose scoring models have been created to automate the process of quantifying these tail events. This phenomenon introduces potential human-machine misalignment between the respective scoring mechanisms. In this work, we present a lightweight calibration framework for blackbox models that ensures the alignment of humans and machines with provable guarantees. Our framework provides a rigorous approach to controlling any distortion risk measure that is characterized by a weighted average of quantiles of the loss incurred by the LLM with high confidence. The theoretical foundation of our method relies on the connection between conformal risk control and a traditional family of statistics, i.e., L-statistics. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments that address the issue of human-machine misalignment.

### Evaluating Human Trust in LLM-Based Planners: A Preliminary Study
**Authors**: Shenghui Chen, Yunhao Yang, Kayla Boggess, Seongkook Heo, Lu Feng, Ufuk Topcu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:10:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for planning tasks, offering unique capabilities not found in classical planners such as generating explanations and iterative refinement. However, trust--a critical factor in the adoption of planning systems--remains underexplored in the context of LLM-based planning tasks. This study bridges this gap by comparing human trust in LLM-based planners with classical planners through a user study in a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain. Combining subjective measures, such as trust questionnaires, with objective metrics like evaluation accuracy, our findings reveal that correctness is the primary driver of trust and performance. Explanations provided by the LLM improved evaluation accuracy but had limited impact on trust, while plan refinement showed potential for increasing trust without significantly enhancing evaluation accuracy.

### A review of Bayesian sensor-based estimation and uncertainty   quantification of aerodynamic flows
**Authors**: Jeff D. Eldredge, Hanieh Mousavi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:08:31Z

**Summary**: Many applications in aerodynamics depend on the use of sensors to estimate the evolving state of the flow. In particular, a wide variety of traditional and learning-based strategies for closed-loop control rely on some knowledge of the aerodynamic state in order to decide on actions. This estimation task is inherently accompanied by uncertainty due to the noisy measurements of sensors or the non-uniqueness of the underlying mapping, and knowledge of this uncertainty can be as important for decision-making as that of the state itself. The tracking of uncertainty is challenged by the often-nonlinear relationship between the sensor measurements and the flow state. For example, a collection of passing vortices leaves a footprint in wall pressure sensors that depends nonlinearly on the strengths and positions of the vortices. In this paper, we will review the recent body of work on flow estimation. We will discuss the basic tools of probability, including sampling and estimation, in the powerful setting of Bayesian inference and demonstrate these tools in static flow estimation examples. We will then proceed to unsteady examples and illustrate the application of sequential estimation, and particularly, the ensemble Kalman filter. Finally, we will discuss uncertainty quantification in neural network approximations of the mappings between sensor measurements and flow states. Recent aerodynamic applications of neural networks have shown that the flow state can be encoded into a very low-dimensional latent space, and we will discuss the implications of this encoding on uncertainty.

### A Counterfactual Analysis of the Dishonest Casino
**Authors**: Martin Haugh, Raghav Singal

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:01:51Z

**Summary**: The dishonest casino is a well-known hidden Markov model (HMM) used in educational settings to introduce HMMs and graphical models. Here, a sequence of die rolls is observed, with the casino switching between a fair and a loaded die. Typically, the goal is to use the observed rolls to infer the pattern of fair and loaded dice, leading to filtering, smoothing, and Viterbi algorithms. This paper, however, explores how much of the winnings is attributable to the casino's cheating, a counterfactual question beyond the scope of HMM primitives. To address this, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) consistent with the HMM and show the expected winnings attributable to cheating (EWAC) (which is only partially identifiable) can be bounded using linear programs (LPs). Through numerical experiments, we compute these bounds and develop intuition using benchmark SCMs based on independence, comonotonic, and counter-monotonic copulas. We show that tighter bounds are obtained with a time-homogeneity condition on the SCM, while looser bounds allow for an almost explicit LP solution. Domain-specific knowledge such as pathwise monotonicity or counterfactual stability can be incorporated via linear constraints. We also show the time-average EWAC is fully identifiable in the limit as the number of time periods goes to infinity. Our work contributes to bounding counterfactuals in causal inference and is the first to develop LP bounds in a dynamic HMM setting, benefiting educational contexts where counterfactual inference is taught.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:01:09Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.

### Large Language Models as Attribution Regularizers for Efficient Model   Training
**Authors**: Davor Vukadin, Marin Šilić, Goran Delač

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:55:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead.   Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.

**Authors**: Vedant Das Swain, Qiuyue "Joy" Zhong, Jash Rajesh Parekh, Yechan Jeon, Roy Zimmermann, Mary Czerwinski, Jina Suh, Varun Mishra, Koustuv Saha, Javier Hernandez

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:53:40Z

**Summary**: Client-Service Representatives (CSRs) are vital to organizations. Frequent interactions with disgruntled clients, however, disrupt their mental well-being. To help CSRs regulate their emotions while interacting with uncivil clients, we designed Care-Pilot, an LLM-powered assistant, and evaluated its efficacy, perception, and use. Our comparative analyses between 665 human and Care-Pilot-generated support messages highlight Care-Pilot's ability to adapt to and demonstrate empathy in various incivility incidents. Additionally, 143 CSRs assessed Care-Pilot's empathy as more sincere and actionable than human messages. Finally, we interviewed 20 CSRs who interacted with Care-Pilot in a simulation exercise. They reported that Care-Pilot helped them avoid negative thinking, recenter thoughts, and humanize clients; showing potential for bridging gaps in coworker support. Yet, they also noted deployment challenges and emphasized the indispensability of shared experiences. We discuss future designs and societal implications of AI-mediated emotional labor, underscoring empathy as a critical function for AI assistants for worker mental health.

### A Large-Scale Simulation on Large Language Models for Decision-Making in   Political Science
**Authors**: Chenxiao Yu, Jinyi Ye, Yuangang Li, Zhaotian Weng, Zheng Li, Emilio Ferrara, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:47:40Z

**Summary**: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning, their ability to simulate human decision-making -- particularly in political contexts -- remains an open question. However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.

### LLM as a Broken Telephone: Iterative Generation Distorts Information
**Authors**: Amr Mohamed, Mingmeng Geng, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Guokan Shang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:46:23Z

**Summary**: As large language models are increasingly responsible for online content, concerns arise about the impact of repeatedly processing their own outputs. Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.

### GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for   Generalized 3D Manipulation
**Authors**: Yangtao Chen, Zixuan Chen, Junhui Yin, Jing Huo, Pinzhuo Tian, Jieqi Shi, Yang Gao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:43:27Z

**Summary**: Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation. Video demonstrations are available at: https://gravmad.github.io.

**Summary**: With the development of large language models, their ability to follow simple instructions has significantly improved. However, adhering to complex instructions remains a major challenge. Current approaches to generating complex instructions are often irrelevant to the current instruction requirements or suffer from limited scalability and diversity. Moreover, methods such as back-translation, while effective for simple instruction generation, fail to leverage the rich contents and structures in large web corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic iterative refinement framework to generate complex instructions with constraints, which not only better reflects the requirements of real scenarios but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. The AIR framework consists of two stages: (1)Generate an initial instruction from a document; (2)Iteratively refine instructions with LLM-as-judge guidance by comparing the model's output with the document to incorporate valuable constraints. Finally, we construct the AIR-10K dataset with 10K complex instructions and demonstrate that instructions generated with our approach significantly improve the model's ability to follow complex instructions, outperforming existing methods for instruction generation.

### Recommendations by Concise User Profiles from Review Text
**Authors**: Ghazaleh Haratinezhad Torbati, Anna Tigunova, Andrew Yates, Gerhard Weikum

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:36:08Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems perform well for popular items and users with ample interactions (likes, ratings etc.). This work addresses the difficult and underexplored case of users who have very sparse interactions but post informative review texts. This setting naturally calls for encoding user-specific text with large language models (LLM). However, feeding the full text of all reviews through an LLM has a weak signal-to-noise ratio and incurs high costs of processed tokens. This paper addresses these two issues. It presents a light-weight framework, called CUP, which first computes concise user profiles and feeds only these into the training of transformer-based recommenders. For user profiles, we devise various techniques to select the most informative cues from noisy reviews. Experiments, with book reviews data, show that fine-tuning a small language model with judiciously constructed profiles achieves the best performance, even in comparison to LLM-generated rankings.

**Authors**: Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Jiaheng Liu, Weixun Wang, Xingyuan Bu, Ge Zhang, Zhongyuan Peng, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Zhicheng Zheng, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:34:04Z

**Summary**: Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.

**Summary**: Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, traditional RM training, which relies on response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle prompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response length and format. In this work, we expose a fundamental limitation of current RM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between contextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To address this, we introduce a causal framework that learns preferences independent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique designed to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that our approach successfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward model (RRM). Our RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model trained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to 84.15%. Additionally, we train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM, demonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies, improving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in AlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%.

### Beyond Natural Language Perplexity: Detecting Dead Code Poisoning in   Code Generation Datasets
**Authors**: Chichien Tsai, Chiamu Yu, Yingdar Lin, Yusung Wu, Weibin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:30:00Z

**Summary**: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets. One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior. Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions. Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code. DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision. Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing. Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.

### FINEREASON: Evaluating and Improving LLMs' Deliberate Reasoning through   Reflective Puzzle Solving
**Authors**: Guizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Hao Zhang, Hou Pong Chan, Chaoqun Liu, Lidong Bing, Deli Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, Yu Rong

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:23:25Z

**Summary**: Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.

### AI Will Always Love You: Studying Implicit Biases in Romantic AI   Companions
**Authors**: Clare Grogan, Jackie Kay, María Pérez-Ortiz

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:16:37Z

**Summary**: While existing studies have recognised explicit biases in generative models, including occupational gender biases, the nuances of gender stereotypes and expectations of relationships between users and AI companions remain underexplored. In the meantime, AI companions have become increasingly popular as friends or gendered romantic partners to their users. This study bridges the gap by devising three experiments tailored for romantic, gender-assigned AI companions and their users, effectively evaluating implicit biases across various-sized LLMs. Each experiment looks at a different dimension: implicit associations, emotion responses, and sycophancy. This study aims to measure and compare biases manifested in different companion systems by quantitatively analysing persona-assigned model responses to a baseline through newly devised metrics. The results are noteworthy: they show that assigning gendered, relationship personas to Large Language Models significantly alters the responses of these models, and in certain situations in a biased, stereotypical way.

### Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via   Machine Learning
**Authors**: N. K. Patra, Tuhin Malik, Helena Pais, Kai Zhou, B. K. Agrawal, Constança Providência

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:12:52Z

**Summary**: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.

### Liquid: Language Models are Scalable and Unified Multi-modal Generators
**Authors**: Junfeng Wu, Yi Jiang, Chuofan Ma, Yuliang Liu, Hengshuang Zhao, Zehuan Yuan, Song Bai, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:08:51Z

**Summary**: We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/FoundationVision/Liquid.

### Congruence Closure Modulo Groups
**Authors**: Dohan Kim

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:06:25Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a new framework for constructing congruence closure of a finite set of ground equations over uninterpreted symbols and interpreted symbols for the group axioms. In this framework, ground equations are flattened into certain forms by introducing new constants, and a completion procedure is performed on ground flat equations. The proposed completion procedure uses equational inference rules and constructs a ground convergent rewrite system for congruence closure with such interpreted symbols. If the completion procedure terminates, then it yields a decision procedure for the word problem for a finite set of ground equations with respect to the group axioms. This paper also provides a sufficient terminating condition of the completion procedure for constructing a ground convergent rewrite system from ground flat equations containing interpreted symbols for the group axioms. In addition, this paper presents a new method for constructing congruence closure of a finite set of ground equations containing interpreted symbols for the semigroup, monoid, and the multiple disjoint sets of group axioms, respectively, using the proposed framework.

**Authors**: Abdur-Rahman Ibrahim Sayyid-Ali, Abdul Rafay, Muhammad Abdullah Soomro, Muhammad Hamad Alizai, Naveed Anwar Bhatti

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:05:40Z

**Summary**: Batteryless IoT systems face energy constraints exacerbated by checkpointing overhead. Approximate computing offers solutions but demands manual expertise, limiting scalability. This paper presents CheckMate, an automated framework leveraging LLMs for context-aware code approximations. CheckMate integrates validation of LLM-generated approximations to ensure correct execution and employs Bayesian optimization to fine-tune approximation parameters autonomously, eliminating the need for developer input. Tested across six IoT applications, it reduces power cycles by up to 60% with an accuracy loss of just 8%, outperforming semi-automated tools like ACCEPT in speedup and accuracy. CheckMate's results establish it as a robust, user-friendly tool and a foundational step toward automated approximation frameworks for intermittent computing.

### Avat3r: Large Animatable Gaussian Reconstruction Model for High-fidelity   3D Head Avatars
**Authors**: Tobias Kirschstein, Javier Romero, Artem Sevastopolsky, Matthias Nießner, Shunsuke Saito

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:00:11Z

**Summary**: Traditionally, creating photo-realistic 3D head avatars requires a studio-level multi-view capture setup and expensive optimization during test-time, limiting the use of digital human doubles to the VFX industry or offline renderings.   To address this shortcoming, we present Avat3r, which regresses a high-quality and animatable 3D head avatar from just a few input images, vastly reducing compute requirements during inference. More specifically, we make Large Reconstruction Models animatable and learn a powerful prior over 3D human heads from a large multi-view video dataset. For better 3D head reconstructions, we employ position maps from DUSt3R and generalized feature maps from the human foundation model Sapiens. To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video.   We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts.

### ChineseEcomQA: A Scalable E-commerce Concept Evaluation Benchmark for   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haibin Chen, Kangtao Lv, Chengwei Hu, Yanshi Li, Yujin Yuan, Yancheng He, Xingyao Zhang, Langming Liu, Shilei Liu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:36:00Z

**Summary**: With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in fields such as e-commerce, domain-specific concept evaluation benchmarks are crucial for assessing their domain capabilities. Existing LLMs may generate factually incorrect information within the complex e-commerce applications. Therefore, it is necessary to build an e-commerce concept benchmark. Existing benchmarks encounter two primary challenges: (1) handle the heterogeneous and diverse nature of tasks, (2) distinguish between generality and specificity within the e-commerce field. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{ChineseEcomQA}, a scalable question-answering benchmark focused on fundamental e-commerce concepts. ChineseEcomQA is built on three core characteristics: \textbf{Focus on Fundamental Concept}, \textbf{E-commerce Generality} and \textbf{E-commerce Expertise}. Fundamental concepts are designed to be applicable across a diverse array of e-commerce tasks, thus addressing the challenge of heterogeneity and diversity. Additionally, by carefully balancing generality and specificity, ChineseEcomQA effectively differentiates between broad e-commerce concepts, allowing for precise validation of domain capabilities. We achieve this through a scalable benchmark construction process that combines LLM validation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) validation, and rigorous manual annotation. Based on ChineseEcomQA, we conduct extensive evaluations on mainstream LLMs and provide some valuable insights. We hope that ChineseEcomQA could guide future domain-specific evaluations, and facilitate broader LLM adoption in e-commerce applications.

### Remove Symmetries to Control Model Expressivity and Improve Optimization
**Authors**: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:30:47Z

**Summary**: When symmetry is present in the loss function, the model is likely to be trapped in a low-capacity state that is sometimes known as a "collapse". Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training and inference. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. When this type of entrapment is especially a concern, removing symmetries with the proposed method is shown to correlate well with improved optimization or performance. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:29:03Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

### Improved Baselines with Synchronized Encoding for Universal Medical   Image Segmentation
**Authors**: Sihan Yang, Xuande Mi, Jiadong Feng, Haixia Bi, Hai Zhang, Jian Sun

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:24:27Z

**Summary**: Large foundation models, known for their strong zero-shot generalization capabilities, can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, developing foundation models for medical image segmentation poses a significant challenge due to the domain gap between natural and medical images. While fine-tuning techniques based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have been explored, they primarily focus on scaling up data or refining inference strategies without incorporating domain-specific architectural designs, limiting their zero-shot performance. To optimize segmentation performance under standard inference settings and provide a strong baseline for future research, we introduce SyncSAM, which employs a synchronized dual-branch encoder that integrates convolution and Transformer features in a synchronized manner to enhance medical image encoding, and a multi-scale dual-branch decoder to preserve image details. SyncSAM is trained on two of the largest medical image segmentation datasets, SA-Med2D-20M and IMed-361M, resulting in a series of pre-trained models for universal medical image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SyncSAM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on test sets but also exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on unseen datasets. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SyncSAM.

### Bisecting K-Means in RAG for Enhancing Question-Answering Tasks   Performance in Telecommunications
**Authors**: Pedro Sousa, Cláudio Klautau Mello, Frank B. Morte, Luis F. Solis Navarro

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:23:18Z

**Summary**: Question-answering tasks in the telecom domain are still reasonably unexplored in the literature, primarily due to the field's rapid changes and evolving standards. This work presents a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework explicitly designed for the telecommunication domain, focusing on datasets composed of 3GPP documents. The framework introduces the use of the Bisecting K-Means clustering technique to organize the embedding vectors by contents, facilitating more efficient information retrieval. By leveraging this clustering technique, the system pre-selects a subset of clusters that are most similar to the user's query, enhancing the relevance of the retrieved information. Aiming for models with lower computational cost for inference, the framework was tested using Small Language Models, demonstrating improved performance with an accuracy of 66.12% on phi-2 and 72.13% on phi-3 fine-tuned models, and reduced training time.

### Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic: Disentangling Task-Specific and   Instruction-Following Knowledge
**Authors**: Yan-Lun Chen, Yi-Ru Wei, Chia-Yi Hsu, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Ying Huang, Ying-Dar Lin, Yu-Sung Wu, Wei-Bin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:22:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong task-specific capabilities through fine-tuning, but merging multiple fine-tuned models often leads to degraded performance due to overlapping instruction-following components. Task Arithmetic (TA), which combines task vectors derived from fine-tuning, enables multi-task learning and task forgetting but struggles to isolate task-specific knowledge from general instruction-following behavior. To address this, we propose Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic (LATA), a novel approach that assigns layer-specific weights to task vectors based on their alignment with instruction-following or task-specific components. By amplifying task-relevant layers and attenuating instruction-following layers, LATA improves task learning and forgetting performance while preserving overall model utility. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including WikiText-2, GSM8K, and HumanEval, demonstrate that LATA outperforms existing methods in both multi-task learning and selective task forgetting, achieving higher task accuracy and alignment with minimal degradation in output quality. Our findings highlight the importance of layer-wise analysis in disentangling task-specific and general-purpose knowledge, offering a robust framework for efficient model merging and editing.

### From the marginal likelihood of a two-way table to ecological inference
**Authors**: Antonio Forcina

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:17:21Z

**Summary**: The paper extends in two directions the work of \cite{Plackett77} who studied how, in a $2\times 2$ table, the likelihood of the column totals depends on the odds ratio. First, we study the marginal likelihood of a single $R\times C$ frequency table when only the marginal frequencies are observed and then consider a collection of, say, $s$ $R\times C$ tables, where only the row and column totals can be observed, which is the basic framework which in applications of Ecological Inference. In the simpler context, we derive the likelihood equations and show that the likelihood has a collection of local maxima which, after a suitable rearrangement of the row and column categories, exhibit the strongest positive association compatible with the marginals, a kind of paradox, considering that the available data are so poor. Next, we derive the likelihood equations for the marginal likelihood of a collection of tow-way tables, under the assumption that they share the same row conditional distributions and derive a necessary condition for the information matrix to be well defined. We also describe a Fisher-scoring algorithm for maximizing the marginal likelihood which, however, can be used only if the number of available replications reaches a given threshold.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:13:07Z

**Summary**: In recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited proficiency in code generation and chain-of-thought reasoning, laying the groundwork for tackling automatic formal planning tasks. This study evaluates the potential of LLMs to understand and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), an essential representation in artificial intelligence planning. We conduct an extensive analysis across 20 distinct models spanning 7 major LLM families, both commercial and open-source. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the zero-shot LLM capabilities of parsing, generating, and reasoning with PDDL. Our findings indicate that while some models demonstrate notable effectiveness in handling PDDL, others pose limitations in more complex scenarios requiring nuanced planning knowledge. These results highlight the promise and current limitations of LLMs in formal planning tasks, offering insights into their application and guiding future efforts in AI-driven planning paradigms.

### The Impact of Unstated Norms in Bias Analysis of Language Models
**Authors**: Farnaz Kohankhaki, D. B. Emerson, Jacob-Junqi Tian, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Faiza Khan Khattak

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:11:54Z

**Summary**: Bias in large language models (LLMs) has many forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. Counterfactual bias evaluation is a widely used approach to quantifying bias and often relies on template-based probes that explicitly state group membership. It measures whether the outcome of a task performed by an LLM is invariant to a change in group membership. In this work, we find that template-based probes can lead to unrealistic bias measurements. For example, LLMs appear to mistakenly cast text associated with White race as negative at higher rates than other groups. We hypothesize that this arises artificially via a mismatch between commonly unstated norms, in the form of markedness, in the pretraining text of LLMs (e.g., Black president vs. president) and templates used for bias measurement (e.g., Black president vs. White president). The findings highlight the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in counterfactual bias quantification.

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive cross-modal understanding and reasoning abilities, often assessed through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that include an image, a question, and several options. However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.

### Re-evaluating Open-ended Evaluation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siqi Liu, Ian Gemp, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Nicolas Heess, Marc Lanctot

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:07:47Z

**Summary**: Evaluation has traditionally focused on ranking candidates for a specific skill. Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.

### Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Universal Verification
**Authors**: Allen Schmaltz

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:05:00Z

**Summary**: We solve the neural network robustness problem by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training)-awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution-awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary)-awareness of the softmax function. The resulting sdm activation function provides strong signals of the relative epistemic (reducible) predictive uncertainty. We use this novel behavior to further address the complementary HCI problem of mapping the output to human-interpretable summary statistics over relevant partitions of a held-out calibration set. Estimates of prediction-conditional uncertainty are obtained via a parsimonious learned transform over the class-conditional empirical CDFs of the output of a final-layer sdm activation function. For decision-making and as an intrinsic model check, estimates of class-conditional accuracy are obtained by further partitioning the high-probability regions of this calibrated output into class-conditional, region-specific CDFs. The uncertainty estimates from sdm calibration are remarkably robust to test-time distribution shifts and out-of-distribution inputs; incorporate awareness of the effective sample size; provide estimates of uncertainty from the learning and data splitting processes; and are well-suited for selective classification and conditional branching for additional test-time compute based on the predictive uncertainty, as for selective LLM generation, routing, and composition over multiple models and retrieval. Finally, we construct sdm networks, LLMs with uncertainty-aware verification and interpretability-by-exemplar as intrinsic properties. We provide open-source software implementing these results.

### Transfer Learning in Latent Contextual Bandits with Covariate Shift   Through Causal Transportability
**Authors**: Mingwei Deng, Ville Kyrki, Dominik Baumann

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:52:23Z

**Summary**: Transferring knowledge from one environment to another is an essential ability of intelligent systems. Nevertheless, when two environments are different, naively transferring all knowledge may deteriorate the performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer. In this paper, we address this issue within the framework of multi-armed bandits from the perspective of causal inference. Specifically, we consider transfer learning in latent contextual bandits, where the actual context is hidden, but a potentially high-dimensional proxy is observable. We further consider a covariate shift in the context across environments. We show that naively transferring all knowledge for classical bandit algorithms in this setting led to negative transfer. We then leverage transportability theory from causal inference to develop algorithms that explicitly transfer effective knowledge for estimating the causal effects of interest in the target environment. Besides, we utilize variational autoencoders to approximate causal effects under the presence of a high-dimensional proxy. We test our algorithms on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, empirically demonstrating consistently improved learning efficiency across different proxies compared to baseline algorithms, showing the effectiveness of our causal framework in transferring knowledge.

### LongAttn: Selecting Long-context Training Data via Token-level Attention
**Authors**: Longyun Wu, Dawei Zhu, Guangxiang Zhao, Zhuocheng Yu, Junfeng Ran, Xiangyu Wong, Lin Sun, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:50:10Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing need for significant advancements in handling long contexts. To enhance long-context capabilities, constructing high-quality training data with long-range dependencies is crucial. Existing methods to select long-context data often rely on sentence-level analysis, which can be greatly optimized in both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel token-level framework, LongAttn, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the long-range dependencies for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies long-range dependencies, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. We filter LongABC-32K from open-source long-context datasets (ArXiv, Book, and Code). Through our comprehensive experiments, LongAttn has demonstrated its excellent effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency. To facilitate future research in long-context data, we released our code and the high-quality long-context training data LongABC-32K.

### Inferring a Cell Structure on the Space of Cyclooctane Conformations
**Authors**: Ulrich Bauer, Fabian Lenzen

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:44:15Z

**Summary**: The conformation space of cyclooctane, a ringlike organic molecule comprising eight carbon atoms, is a two-dimensional algebraic variety, which has been studied extensively for more than 90 years. We propose a cell structure representing this space, which arises naturally by partitioning the space into subsets of conformations that admit particular symmetries. We do so both for the labeled conformation space, in which the carbon atoms are considered as distinct, and for the actual, unlabeled, conformation space. The proposed cell structure is obtained by identifying subspaces of conformations based on symmetry patterns and studying the geometry and topology of these subsets using methods from dimensionality reduction and topological data analysis. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to the labeled variant, the conformation space of cyclooctane is contractible.

### Telephone Surveys Meet Conversational AI: Evaluating a LLM-Based   Telephone Survey System at Scale
**Authors**: Max M. Lang, Sol Eskenazi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:31:42Z

**Summary**: Telephone surveys remain a valuable tool for gathering insights but typically require substantial resources in training and coordinating human interviewers. This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews on scale.   We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training.   Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.

### BoA: Attention-aware Post-training Quantization without Backpropagation
**Authors**: Junhan Kim, Ho-young Kim, Eulrang Cho, Chungman Lee, Joonyoung Kim, Yongkweon Jeon

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:29:08Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices. Early methods developed for smaller networks like ResNet rely on gradient-based optimization, which becomes impractical for hyper-scale LLMs with billions of parameters. While recently proposed backpropagation-free or transformation-based methods alleviate this issue, their performance remains limited by either a lack of inter-layer dependency consideration or the use of naive nearest-rounding-based integer weight assignment to save the heavy computational cost of weight optimization. We thus introduce a novel backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that optimizes integer weights by considering inter-layer dependencies. The key innovation is the development of attention-aware Hessian matrices that capture inter-layer interactions within the attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms existing weight quantization methods but also shows good synergy with conventional methods to suppress activation outliers, leading to state-of-the-art weight-activation quantization performance.

### Finite State Automata Inside Transformers with Chain-of-Thought: A   Mechanistic Study on State Tracking
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Wenyu Du, Dongming Jin, Jie Fu, Zhi Jin

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:24:51Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, and prior research shows that CoT can theoretically increase expressiveness. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. In this work, we (1) evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit, a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state, finding that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model. (3) Additionally, we explore three realistic settings: skipping intermediate steps, introducing data noise, and testing length generalization. Our results demonstrate that Transformer+CoT learns robust algorithms (FSA), highlighting its resilience in challenging scenarios.

### Bayesian High-dimensional Linear Regression with Sparse   Projection-posterior
**Authors**: Samhita Pal, Subhashis Ghoshal

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:23:40Z

**Summary**: We consider a novel Bayesian approach to estimation, uncertainty quantification, and variable selection for a high-dimensional linear regression model under sparsity. The number of predictors can be nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. We put a conjugate normal prior initially disregarding sparsity, but for making an inference, instead of the original multivariate normal posterior, we use the posterior distribution induced by a map transforming the vector of regression coefficients to a sparse vector obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of deviations plus a suitably scaled $\ell_1$-penalty on the vector. We show that the resulting sparse projection-posterior distribution contracts around the true value of the parameter at the optimal rate adapted to the sparsity of the vector. We show that the true sparsity structure gets a large sparse projection-posterior probability. We further show that an appropriately recentred credible ball has the correct asymptotic frequentist coverage. Finally, we describe how the computational burden can be distributed to many machines, each dealing with only a small fraction of the whole dataset. We conduct a comprehensive simulation study under a variety of settings and found that the proposed method performs well for finite sample sizes. We also apply the method to several real datasets, including the ADNI data, and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art methods. We implemented the method in the \texttt{R} package called \texttt{sparseProj}, and all computations have been carried out using this package.

### Relation Also Knows: Rethinking the Recall and Editing of Factual   Associations in Auto-Regressive Transformer Language Models
**Authors**: Xiyu Liu, Zhengxiao Liu, Naibin Gu, Zheng Lin, Wanli Ma, Ji Xiang, Weiping Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:21:43Z

**Summary**: The storage and recall of factual associations in auto-regressive transformer language models (LMs) have drawn a great deal of attention, inspiring knowledge editing by directly modifying the located model weights. Most editing works achieve knowledge editing under the guidance of existing interpretations of knowledge recall that mainly focus on subject knowledge. However, these interpretations are seriously flawed, neglecting relation information and leading to the over-generalizing problem for editing. In this work, we discover a novel relation-focused perspective to interpret the knowledge recall of transformer LMs during inference and apply it on single knowledge editing to avoid over-generalizing. Experimental results on the dataset supplemented with a new R-Specificity criterion demonstrate that our editing approach significantly alleviates over-generalizing while remaining competitive on other criteria, breaking the domination of subject-focused editing for future research.

### SoRFT: Issue Resolving with Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Zexiong Ma, Chao Peng, Pengfei Gao, Xiangxin Meng, Yanzhen Zou, Bing Xie

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:19:45Z

**Summary**: Mainstream issue-resolving frameworks predominantly rely on commercial models, leading to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing training approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement learning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve 21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B). The experimental results demonstrate that SoRFT significantly enhances issue-resolving performance, improves model generalization, and provides a cost-efficient alternative to commercial models.

### FlexiDiT: Your Diffusion Transformer Can Easily Generate High-Quality   Samples with Less Compute
**Authors**: Sotiris Anagnostidis, Gregor Bachmann, Yeongmin Kim, Jonas Kohler, Markos Georgopoulos, Artsiom Sanakoyeu, Yuming Du, Albert Pumarola, Ali Thabet, Edgar Schönfeld

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:16:56Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable performance, modern Diffusion Transformers are hindered by substantial resource requirements during inference, stemming from the fixed and large amount of compute needed for each denoising step. In this work, we revisit the conventional static paradigm that allocates a fixed compute budget per denoising iteration and propose a dynamic strategy instead. Our simple and sample-efficient framework enables pre-trained DiT models to be converted into \emph{flexible} ones -- dubbed FlexiDiT -- allowing them to process inputs at varying compute budgets. We demonstrate how a single \emph{flexible} model can generate images without any drop in quality, while reducing the required FLOPs by more than $40$\% compared to their static counterparts, for both class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation. Our method is general and agnostic to input and conditioning modalities. We show how our approach can be readily extended for video generation, where FlexiDiT models generate samples with up to $75$\% less compute without compromising performance.

### Exploring Open-world Continual Learning with Knowns-Unknowns Knowledge   Transfer
**Authors**: Yujie Li, Guannan Lai, Xin Yang, Yonghao Li, Marcello Bonsangue, Tianrui Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:16:01Z

**Summary**: Open-World Continual Learning (OWCL) is a challenging paradigm where models must incrementally learn new knowledge without forgetting while operating under an open-world assumption. This requires handling incomplete training data and recognizing unknown samples during inference. However, existing OWCL methods often treat open detection and continual learning as separate tasks, limiting their ability to integrate open-set detection and incremental classification in OWCL. Moreover, current approaches primarily focus on transferring knowledge from known samples, neglecting the insights derived from unknown/open samples. To address these limitations, we formalize four distinct OWCL scenarios and conduct comprehensive empirical experiments to explore potential challenges in OWCL. Our findings reveal a significant interplay between the open detection of unknowns and incremental classification of knowns, challenging a widely held assumption that unknown detection and known classification are orthogonal processes. Building on our insights, we propose \textbf{HoliTrans} (Holistic Knowns-Unknowns Knowledge Transfer), a novel OWCL framework that integrates nonlinear random projection (NRP) to create a more linearly separable embedding space and distribution-aware prototypes (DAPs) to construct an adaptive knowledge space. Particularly, our HoliTrans effectively supports knowledge transfer for both known and unknown samples while dynamically updating representations of open samples during OWCL. Extensive experiments across various OWCL scenarios demonstrate that HoliTrans outperforms 22 competitive baselines, bridging the gap between OWCL theory and practice and providing a robust, scalable framework for advancing open-world learning paradigms.

### Self-Training Elicits Concise Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tergel Munkhbat, Namgyu Ho, Seohyun Kim, Yongjin Yang, Yujin Kim, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:14:50Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to utilize additional computation through intermediate tokens to solve complex tasks. However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

### Sketch & Paint: Stroke-by-Stroke Evolution of Visual Artworks
**Authors**: Jeripothula Prudviraj, Vikram Jamwal

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:11:58Z

**Summary**: Understanding the stroke-based evolution of visual artworks is useful for advancing artwork learning, appreciation, and interactive display. While the stroke sequence of renowned artworks remains largely unknown, formulating this sequence for near-natural image drawing processes can significantly enhance our understanding of artistic techniques. This paper introduces a novel method for approximating artwork stroke evolution through a proximity-based clustering mechanism. We first convert pixel images into vector images via parametric curves and then explore the clustering approach to determine the sequence order of extracted strokes. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates the potential to infer stroke sequences in unknown artworks. We evaluate the performance of our method using WikiArt data and qualitatively demonstrate the plausible stroke sequences. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to handle a wide variety of input image types such as line art, face sketches, paintings, and photographic images. By exploring stroke extraction and sequence construction, we aim to improve our understanding of the intricacies of the art development techniques and the step-by-step reconstruction process behind visual artworks, thereby enriching our understanding of the creative journey from the initial sketch to the final artwork.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:10:03Z

**Summary**: Given the importance of understanding how different innovation processes affect each other, we have introduced a model for a finite system of interacting innovation processes. The present work focuses on the second-order asymptotic properties of the model and illustrates how to leverage the theoretical results in order to make statistical inference on the intensity of the interaction. This methodology is presented within a general framework in the supplementary material to ensure its broad applicability across various contexts. We apply the proposed tools to two real data sets (from Reddit and Gutenberg).

### Invalid proxies and volatility changes
**Authors**: Giovanni Angelini, Luca Fanelli, Luca Neri

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:07:23Z

**Summary**: When in proxy-SVARs the covariance matrix of VAR disturbances is subject to exogenous, permanent breaks that cause IRFs to change across volatility regimes, even strong, exogenous external instruments yield inconsistent estimates of the dynamic causal effects. However, if these volatility shifts are properly incorporated into the analysis through (testable) "stability restrictions", we demonstrate that the target IRFs are point-identified and can be estimated consistently under a necessary and sufficient rank condition. If the shifts in volatility are sufficiently informative, standard asymptotic inference remains valid even with (i) local-to-zero covariance between the proxies and the instrumented structural shocks, and (ii) potential failures of instrument exogeneity. Intuitively, shifts in volatility act similarly to strong instruments that are correlated with both the target and non-target shocks. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by revisiting a seminal fiscal proxy-SVAR for the US economy. We detect a sharp change in the size of the tax multiplier when the narrative tax instrument is complemented with the decline in unconditional volatility observed during the transition from the Great Inflation to the Great Moderation. The narrative tax instrument contributes to identify the tax shock in both regimes, despite our empirical analysis raises concerns about its "statistical" validity.

### UniDepthV2: Universal Monocular Metric Depth Estimation Made Simpler
**Authors**: Luigi Piccinelli, Christos Sakaridis, Yung-Hsu Yang, Mattia Segu, Siyuan Li, Wim Abbeloos, Luc Van Gool

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:03:15Z

**Summary**: Accurate monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) is crucial to solving downstream tasks in 3D perception and modeling. However, the remarkable accuracy of recent MMDE methods is confined to their training domains. These methods fail to generalize to unseen domains even in the presence of moderate domain gaps, which hinders their practical applicability. We propose a new model, UniDepthV2, capable of reconstructing metric 3D scenes from solely single images across domains. Departing from the existing MMDE paradigm, UniDepthV2 directly predicts metric 3D points from the input image at inference time without any additional information, striving for a universal and flexible MMDE solution. In particular, UniDepthV2 implements a self-promptable camera module predicting a dense camera representation to condition depth features. Our model exploits a pseudo-spherical output representation, which disentangles the camera and depth representations. In addition, we propose a geometric invariance loss that promotes the invariance of camera-prompted depth features. UniDepthV2 improves its predecessor UniDepth model via a new edge-guided loss which enhances the localization and sharpness of edges in the metric depth outputs, a revisited, simplified and more efficient architectural design, and an additional uncertainty-level output which enables downstream tasks requiring confidence. Thorough evaluations on ten depth datasets in a zero-shot regime consistently demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of UniDepthV2.

### How Far Are We on the Decision-Making of LLMs? Evaluating LLMs' Gaming   Ability in Multi-Agent Environments
**Authors**: Jen-tse Huang, Eric John Li, Man Ho Lam, Tian Liang, Wenxuan Wang, Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xing Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael R. Lyu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:57:52Z

**Summary**: Decision-making is a complex process requiring diverse abilities, making it an excellent framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate 13 LLMs from 6 model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $69.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($65.9$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($62.4$). Our code and experimental results are publicly available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/GAMABench.

### Bag of Design Choices for Inference of High-Resolution Masked Generative   Transformer
**Authors**: Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Tian Ye, Lichen Bai, Zhiqiang Xu, Zeke Xie

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:51:10Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) develop at an unprecedented pace, supported by thorough theoretical exploration and empirical analysis. Unfortunately, the discrepancy between DMs and autoregressive models (ARMs) complicates the path toward achieving the goal of unified vision and language generation. Recently, the masked generative Transformer (MGT) serves as a promising intermediary between DM and ARM by predicting randomly masked image tokens (i.e., masked image modeling), combining the efficiency of DM with the discrete token nature of ARM. However, we find that the comprehensive analyses regarding the inference for MGT are virtually non-existent, and thus we aim to present positive design choices to fill this gap. We propose and redesign a set of enhanced inference techniques tailored for MGT, providing a detailed analysis of their performance. Additionally, we explore several DM-based approaches aimed at accelerating the sampling process on MGT. Extensive experiments and empirical analyses on the recent SOTA MGT, such as MaskGIT and Meissonic lead to concrete and effective design choices, and these design choices can be merged to achieve further performance gains. For instance, in terms of enhanced inference, we achieve winning rates of approximately 70% compared to vanilla sampling on HPS v2 with Meissonic-1024x1024.

### Free Anytime Validity by Sequentializing a Test and Optional   Continuation with Tests as Future Significance Levels
**Authors**: Nick W. Koning, Sam van Meer

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:50:49Z

**Summary**: Anytime valid sequential tests permit us to stop and continue testing based on the current data, without invalidating the inference. Given a maximum number of observations $N$, one may believe this must come at the cost of power when compared to a conventional test that waits until all $N$ observations have arrived. Our first contribution is to show that this is false: for any valid test based on $N$ observations, we derive an anytime valid sequential test that matches it after $N$ observations. Our second contribution is that the outcome of a continuously-interpreted test can be used as a significance level in subsequent testing, leading to an overall procedure that is valid at the original significance level. Combined this shows both the value of continuously-interpreted tests, and the fact that anytime validity and optional continuation are readily available in traditional testing, without requiring explicit use of e-values. We illustrate this by deriving the anytime valid sequentialized $z$-test and $t$-test, which at time $N$ coincide with the traditional $z$-test and $t$-test. Lastly, we show the popular log-optimal sequential $z$-test can be interpreted as desiring a rejection by the traditional $z$-test at some tiny significance level in the distant future.

### Subspace accelerated measure transport methods for fast and scalable   sequential experimental design, with application to photoacoustic imaging
**Authors**: Tiangang Cui, Karina Koval, Roland Herzog, Robert Scheichl

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:44:15Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems involving expensive models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.

### LongRoPE2: Near-Lossless LLM Context Window Scaling
**Authors**: Ning Shang, Li Lyna Zhang, Siyuan Wang, Gaokai Zhang, Gilsinia Lopez, Fan Yang, Weizhu Chen, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:41:07Z

**Summary**: LongRoPE2 is a novel approach that extends the effective context window of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to the target length, while preserving the performance on the original shorter context window. This is achieved by three contributions: (1) a hypothesis that insufficient training in higher RoPE dimensions contributes to the persistent out-of-distribution (OOD) issues observed in existing methods; (2) an effective RoPE rescaling algorithm that adopts evolutionary search guided by "needle-driven" perplexity to address the insufficient training problem; (3) a mixed context window training approach that fine-tunes model weights to adopt rescaled RoPE for long-context sequences while preserving the short-context performance with the original RoPE. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3-8B and Phi3-mini-3.8B across various benchmarks validate the hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of LongRoPE2. Remarkably, LongRoPE2 extends LLaMA3-8B to achieve a 128K effective context length while retaining over 98.5% of short-context performance, using only 10B tokens -- 80x fewer than Meta's approach, which fails to reach the target effective context length. Code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/LongRoPE.

### AgentSquare: Automatic LLM Agent Search in Modular Design Space
**Authors**: Yu Shang, Yu Li, Keyu Zhao, Likai Ma, Jiahe Liu, Fengli Xu, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:33:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a rapid growth of agentic systems capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks. However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community. Code repo is available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentSquare.

### Purported quantitative support for multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2   into humans is an artefact of an imbalanced hypothesis testing framework
**Authors**: Angus McCowan

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:33:27Z

**Summary**: A prominent report claimed substantial support for two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans using a calculation that combined phylodynamic inferences and epidemic models. Inspection of the calculation identifies an imbalance in the hypothesis testing framework that confounds this result; the single-introduction model was tested against more stringent conditions than the two-introduction model. Here, I show that when the two-introduction model is tested against the same conditions, the support disappears.

### Collab-Overcooked: Benchmarking and Evaluating Large Language Models as   Collaborative Agents
**Authors**: Haochen Sun, Shuwen Zhang, Lei Ren, Hao Xu, Hao Fu, Caixia Yuan, Xiaojie Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:31:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 10 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaption that are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. Environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and an integrated evaluation package are now publicly available at https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:20:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce Kanana, a series of bilingual language models that demonstrate exceeding performance in Korean and competitive performance in English. The computational cost of Kanana is significantly lower than that of state-of-the-art models of similar size. The report details the techniques employed during pre-training to achieve compute-efficient yet competitive models, including high quality data filtering, staged pre-training, depth up-scaling, and pruning and distillation. Furthermore, the report outlines the methodologies utilized during the post-training of the Kanana models, encompassing supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, aimed at enhancing their capability for seamless interaction with users. Lastly, the report elaborates on plausible approaches used for language model adaptation to specific scenarios, such as embedding, retrieval augmented generation, and function calling. The Kanana model series spans from 2.1B to 32.5B parameters with 2.1B models (base, instruct, embedding) publicly released to promote research on Korean language models.

**Authors**: Mianqiu Huang, Xiaoran Liu, Shaojun Zhou, Mozhi Zhang, Qipeng Guo, Linyang Li, Chenkun Tan, Yang Gao, Pengyu Wang, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:08:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in model architectures and length extrapolation techniques have significantly extended the context length of large language models (LLMs), paving the way for their application in increasingly complex tasks. However, despite the growing capabilities of long-context LLMs, the safety issues in long-context scenarios remain underexplored. While safety alignment in short context has been widely studied, the safety concerns of long-context LLMs have not been adequately addressed. In this work, we introduce \textbf{LongSafety}, a comprehensive safety alignment dataset for long-context LLMs, containing 10 tasks and 17k samples, with an average length of 40.9k tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that training with LongSafety can enhance long-context safety performance while enhancing short-context safety and preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-context safety does not equal long-context alignment with short-context safety data and LongSafety has generalizing capabilities in context length and long-context safety scenarios.

### Say Less, Mean More: Leveraging Pragmatics in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Haris Riaz, Ellen Riloff, Mihai Surdeanu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:55:08Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple, unsupervised method that injects pragmatic principles in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks such as Dense Passage Retrieval to enhance the utility of retrieved contexts. Our approach first identifies which sentences in a pool of documents retrieved by RAG are most relevant to the question at hand, cover all the topics addressed in the input question and no more, and then highlights these sentences within their context, before they are provided to the LLM, without truncating or altering the context in any other way. We show that this simple idea brings consistent improvements in experiments on three question answering tasks (ARC-Challenge, PubHealth and PopQA) using five different LLMs. It notably enhances relative accuracy by up to 19.7% on PubHealth and 10% on ARC-Challenge compared to a conventional RAG system.

### GPT4Image: Large Pre-trained Models Help Vision Models Learn Better on   Perception Task
**Authors**: Ning Ding, Yehui Tang, Zhongqian Fu, Chao Xu, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:49:05Z

**Summary**: The upsurge in pre-trained large models started by ChatGPT has swept across the entire deep learning community. Such powerful models demonstrate advanced generative ability and multimodal understanding capability, which quickly set new state of the arts on a variety of benchmarks. The pre-trained LLM usually plays the role as a universal AI model that can conduct various tasks like article analysis and image comprehension. However, due to the prohibitively high memory and computational cost of implementing such a large model, the conventional models (such as CNN and ViT) are still essential for many visual perception tasks. In this paper, we propose to enhance the representation ability of ordinary vision models on perception tasks (e.g. image classification) by taking advantage of the off-the-shelf large pre-trained models. We present a new learning framework, dubbed GPT4Image, where the knowledge of the large pre-trained models are extracted to help CNNs and ViTs learn better representations and achieve higher performance. Firstly, we curate a high quality description set by prompting a multimodal LLM to generate descriptions for training images. Then, these detailed descriptions are fed into a pre-trained encoder to extract text embeddings that encodes the rich semantics of images. During training, text embeddings will serve as extra supervising signal and be aligned with image representations learned by vision models. The alignment process helps vision models achieve better performance with the aid of pre-trained LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various visual perception tasks for heterogeneous model architectures.

### Frequency-Adaptive Low-Latency Object Detection Using Events and Frames
**Authors**: Haitian Zhang, Xiangyuan Wang, Chang Xu, Xinya Wang, Fang Xu, Huai Yu, Lei Yu, Wen Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:43:29Z

**Summary**: Fusing Events and RGB images for object detection leverages the robustness of Event cameras in adverse environments and the rich semantic information provided by RGB cameras. However, two critical mismatches: low-latency Events \textit{vs.}~high-latency RGB frames; temporally sparse labels in training \textit{vs.}~continuous flow in inference, significantly hinder the high-frequency fusion-based object detection. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{F}requency-\textbf{A}daptive Low-Latency \textbf{O}bject \textbf{D}etector (FAOD). FAOD aligns low-frequency RGB frames with high-frequency Events through an Align Module, which reinforces cross-modal style and spatial proximity to address the Event-RGB Mismatch. We further propose a training strategy, Time Shift, which enforces the module to align the prediction from temporally shifted Event-RGB pairs and their original representation, that is, consistent with Event-aligned annotations. This strategy enables the network to use high-frequency Event data as the primary reference while treating low-frequency RGB images as supplementary information, retaining the low-latency nature of the Event stream toward high-frequency detection. Furthermore, we observe that these corrected Event-RGB pairs demonstrate better generalization from low training frequency to higher inference frequencies compared to using Event data alone. Extensive experiments on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD and DSEC-Detection datasets demonstrate that our FAOD achieves SOTA performance. Specifically, in the PKU-DAVIS-SOD Dataset, FAOD achieves 9.8 points improvement in terms of the mAP in fully paired Event-RGB data with only a quarter of the parameters compared to SODFormer, and even maintains robust performance (only a 3 points drop in mAP) under 80$\times$ Event-RGB frequency mismatch.

### ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning
**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. Our code has been made available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/ThinK.

### 3D-AffordanceLLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Open-Vocabulary   Affordance Detection in 3D Worlds
**Authors**: Hengshuo Chu, Xiang Deng, Xiaoyang Chen, Yinchuan Li, Jianye Hao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:29:44Z

**Summary**: 3D Affordance detection is a challenging problem with broad applications on various robotic tasks. Existing methods typically formulate the detection paradigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on predefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language, resulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these limitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into \textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task is designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text, which avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the \textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning affordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large language models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed decoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning affordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets for training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general segmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e., \textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to equip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the object-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM obtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM leverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\% improvement in mIoU on open-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.

### Knowledge Localization: Mission Not Accomplished? Enter Query   Localization!
**Authors**: Yuheng Chen, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:29:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the mechanisms behind how they store and express this knowledge remain unclear. The Knowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these mechanisms. This theory is based on the Knowledge Localization (KL) assumption, which suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units, namely knowledge neurons.   However, this assumption has two limitations: first, it may be too rigid regarding knowledge storage, and second, it neglects the role of the attention module in knowledge expression.   In this paper, we first re-examine the KL assumption and demonstrate that its limitations do indeed exist. To address these, we then present two new findings, each targeting one of the limitations: one focusing on knowledge storage and the other on knowledge expression. We summarize these findings as \textbf{Query Localization} (QL) assumption and argue that the KL assumption can be viewed as a simplification of the QL assumption. Based on QL assumption, we further propose the Consistency-Aware KN modification method, which improves the performance of knowledge modification, further validating our new assumption. We conduct 39 sets of experiments, along with additional visualization experiments, to rigorously confirm our conclusions. Code is available at https://github.com/heng840/KnowledgeLocalization.

### EchoScene: Indoor Scene Generation via Information Echo over Scene Graph   Diffusion
**Authors**: Guangyao Zhai, Evin Pınar Örnek, Dave Zhenyu Chen, Ruotong Liao, Yan Di, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari, Benjamin Busam

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:28:21Z

**Summary**: We present EchoScene, an interactive and controllable generative model that generates 3D indoor scenes on scene graphs. EchoScene leverages a dual-branch diffusion model that dynamically adapts to scene graphs. Existing methods struggle to handle scene graphs due to varying numbers of nodes, multiple edge combinations, and manipulator-induced node-edge operations. EchoScene overcomes this by associating each node with a denoising process and enables collaborative information exchange, enhancing controllable and consistent generation aware of global constraints. This is achieved through an information echo scheme in both shape and layout branches. At every denoising step, all processes share their denoising data with an information exchange unit that combines these updates using graph convolution. The scheme ensures that the denoising processes are influenced by a holistic understanding of the scene graph, facilitating the generation of globally coherent scenes. The resulting scenes can be manipulated during inference by editing the input scene graph and sampling the noise in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate our approach, which maintains scene controllability and surpasses previous methods in generation fidelity. Moreover, the generated scenes are of high quality and thus directly compatible with off-the-shelf texture generation. Code and trained models are open-sourced.

### Persistent Sampling: Enhancing the Efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Minas Karamanis, Uroš Seljak

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:15:38Z

**Summary**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.

### Training-free Diffusion Model Alignment with Sampling Demons
**Authors**: Po-Hung Yeh, Kuang-Huei Lee, Jun-Cheng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:13:38Z

**Summary**: Aligning diffusion models with user preferences has been a key challenge. Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the average aesthetics scores for text-to-image generation. Implementation is available at https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DemonSampling.

### ProtoOcc: Accurate, Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction Using Dual Branch   Encoder-Prototype Query Decoder
**Authors**: Jungho Kim, Changwon Kang, Dongyoung Lee, Sehwan Choi, Jun Won Choi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:57:16Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce ProtoOcc, a novel 3D occupancy prediction model designed to predict the occupancy states and semantic classes of 3D voxels through a deep semantic understanding of scenes. ProtoOcc consists of two main components: the Dual Branch Encoder (DBE) and the Prototype Query Decoder (PQD). The DBE produces a new 3D voxel representation by combining 3D voxel and BEV representations across multiple scales through a dual branch structure. This design enhances both performance and computational efficiency by providing a large receptive field for the BEV representation while maintaining a smaller receptive field for the voxel representation. The PQD introduces Prototype Queries to accelerate the decoding process. Scene-Adaptive Prototypes are derived from the 3D voxel features of input sample, while Scene-Agnostic Prototypes are computed by applying Scene-Adaptive Prototypes to an Exponential Moving Average during the training phase. By using these prototype-based queries for decoding, we can directly predict 3D occupancy in a single step, eliminating the need for iterative Transformer decoding. Additionally, we propose the Robust Prototype Learning, which injects noise into prototype generation process and trains the model to denoise during the training phase. ProtoOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with 45.02% mIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark. For single-frame method, it reaches 39.56% mIoU with an inference speed of 12.83 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 3090. Our code can be found at https://github.com/SPA-junghokim/ProtoOcc.

### On window mean survival time with interval-censored data
**Authors**: Takuto Iijima, Tomotaka Momozaki, Shuji Ando

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:48:58Z

**Summary**: In recent years, cancer clinical trials have increasingly encountered non proportional hazards (NPH) scenarios, particularly with the emergence of immunotherapy. In randomized controlled trials comparing immunotherapy with conventional chemotherapy or placebo, late difference and early crossing survivals scenarios are commonly observed. In such cases, window mean survival time (WMST), the area under the survival curve within a pre-specified interval $[\tau_0, \tau_1]$, has gained increasing attention due to its superior power compared to restricted mean survival time (RMST), the area under the survival curve up to a pre-specified time point. Considering the increasing use of progression-free survival as a co-primary endpoint alongside overall survival, there is a critical need to establish a WMST estimation method for interval-censored data; however, sufficient research has yet to be conducted. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a WMST inference method utilizing one-point imputations and Turnbull's method. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the WMST estimation method using mid-point imputation for interval-censored data exhibits comparable performance to that using Turnbull's method. Since the former facilitates standard error calculation, we adopt it as the standard method. Numerical simulations on two-sample tests confirm that the proposed WMST testing method have higher power than RMST in late difference and early crossing survival scenarios, while having compatible power to the log-rank test under the PH. Furthermore, even when pre-specified $\tau_0$ deviated from the clinically desirable time point, WMST consistently maintains higher power than RMST in late difference and early crossing survivals scenarios.

### Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger   astrophysical data. I. Nucleonic models
**Authors**: Jia-Jie Li, Yu Tian, Armen Sedrakian

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:26:36Z

**Summary**: [Background] Bayesian inference frameworks incorporating multi-messenger astrophysical constraints have recently been applied to covariant density functional (CDF) models to constrain their parameters. Among these, frameworks utilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the equation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored. [Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated astrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii among its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such extreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference framework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical data is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints from NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to date for the ``black widow" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates for the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic Bayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum masses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\,M_{\odot}$. However, achieving sufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the HESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose tighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency with current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework for interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the radii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted degrees of freedom in the isovector sector.

**Authors**: Kadir Burak Buldu, Süleyman Özdel, Ka Hei Carrie Lau, Mengdi Wang, Daniel Saad, Sofie Schönborn, Auxane Boch, Enkelejda Kasneci, Efe Bozkir

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:26:20Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in computer graphics, machine learning, and sensor technologies enable numerous opportunities for extended reality (XR) setups for everyday life, from skills training to entertainment. With large corporations offering affordable consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMDs), XR will likely become pervasive, and HMDs will develop as personal devices like smartphones and tablets. However, having intelligent spaces and naturalistic interactions in XR is as important as technological advances so that users grow their engagement in virtual and augmented spaces. To this end, large language model (LLM)--powered non-player characters (NPCs) with speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) models bring significant advantages over conventional or pre-scripted NPCs for facilitating more natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) in XR. This paper provides the community with an open-source, customizable, extendable, and privacy-aware Unity package, CUIfy, that facilitates speech-based NPC-user interaction with widely used LLMs, STT, and TTS models. Our package also supports multiple LLM-powered NPCs per environment and minimizes latency between different computational models through streaming to achieve usable interactions between users and NPCs. We publish our source code in the following repository: https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/cuify

### MALT: Improving Reasoning with Multi-Agent LLM Training
**Authors**: Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Chandler Smith, Rocktim Jyoti Das, Rafael Rafailov, Ivan Laptev, Philip H. S. Torr, Fabio Pizzati, Ronald Clark, Christian Schroeder de Witt

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:25:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.

### PyramidDrop: Accelerating Your Large Vision-Language Models via Pyramid   Visual Redundancy Reduction
**Authors**: Long Xing, Qidong Huang, Xiaoyi Dong, Jiajie Lu, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Conghui He, Jiaqi Wang, Feng Wu, Dahua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:16:33Z

**Summary**: In large vision-language models (LVLMs), images serve as inputs that carry a wealth of information. As the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words" implies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or even thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs, which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely impacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the early layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss of crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To address this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual tokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy progressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we propose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost their efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance loss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of the image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating pyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on a lightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and 55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance. Besides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy for inference acceleration without training, with better performance and lower inference cost than counterparts. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/PyramidDrop.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Zhongyang Li, Ziyue Li, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:59:32Z

**Summary**: In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities (e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.

### Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security   Analysis
**Authors**: Jeffrey Yang Fan Chiang, Seungjae Lee, Jia-Bin Huang, Furong Huang, Yizheng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:56:26Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.

### Multi-Agent Verification: Scaling Test-Time Compute with Multiple   Verifiers
**Authors**: Shalev Lifshitz, Sheila A. McIlraith, Yilun Du

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:53:30Z

**Summary**: By utilizing more computational resources at test-time, large language models (LLMs) can improve without additional training. One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.

**Authors**: Albert Gong, Kamilė Stankevičiūtė, Chao Wan, Anmol Kabra, Raphael Thesmar, Johann Lee, Julius Klenke, Carla P. Gomes, Kilian Q. Weinberger

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:51:22Z

**Summary**: High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/kilian-group/phantom-wiki.

### Bridging Legal Knowledge and AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with   Vector Stores, Knowledge Graphs, and Hierarchical Non-negative Matrix   Factorization
**Authors**: Ryan C. Barron, Maksim E. Eren, Olga M. Serafimova, Cynthia Matuszek, Boian S. Alexandrov

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:35:39Z

**Summary**: Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

### Removing Neural Signal Artifacts with Autoencoder-Targeted Adversarial   Transformers (AT-AT)
**Authors**: Benjamin J. Choi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:31:08Z

**Summary**: Electromyogenic (EMG) noise is a major contamination source in EEG data that can impede accurate analysis of brain-specific neural activity. Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.

### Bridging the Creativity Understanding Gap: Small-Scale Human Alignment   Enables Expert-Level Humor Ranking in LLMs
**Authors**: Kuan Lok Zhou, Jiayi Chen, Siddharth Suresh, Reuben Narad, Timothy T. Rogers, Lalit K Jain, Robert D Nowak, Bob Mankoff, Jifan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:29:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant limitations in understanding creative content, as demonstrated by Hessel et al. (2023)'s influential work on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest (NYCCC). Their study exposed a substantial gap between LLMs and humans in humor comprehension, establishing that understanding and evaluating creative content is key challenge in AI development. We revisit this challenge by decomposing humor understanding into three components and systematically improve each: enhancing visual understanding through improved annotation, utilizing LLM-generated humor reasoning and explanations, and implementing targeted alignment with human preference data. Our refined approach achieves 82.4% accuracy in caption ranking, singificantly improving upon the previous 67% benchmark and matching the performance of world-renowned human experts in this domain. Notably, while attempts to mimic subgroup preferences through various persona prompts showed minimal impact, model finetuning with crowd preferences proved remarkably effective. These findings reveal that LLM limitations in creative judgment can be effectively addressed through focused alignment to specific subgroups and individuals. Lastly, we propose the position that achieving artificial general intelligence necessitates systematic collection of human preference data across creative domains. We advocate that just as human creativity is deeply influenced by individual and cultural preferences, training LLMs with diverse human preference data may be essential for developing true creative understanding.

### KEDRec-LM: A Knowledge-distilled Explainable Drug Recommendation Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Kai Zhang, Rui Zhu, Shutian Ma, Jingwei Xiong, Yejin Kim, Fabricio Murai, Xiaozhong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:22:33Z

**Summary**: Drug discovery is a critical task in biomedical natural language processing (NLP), yet explainable drug discovery remains underexplored. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in natural language understanding and generation. Leveraging LLMs for explainable drug discovery has the potential to improve downstream tasks and real-world applications. In this study, we utilize open-source drug knowledge graphs, clinical trial data, and PubMed publications to construct a comprehensive dataset for the explainable drug discovery task, named \textbf{expRxRec}. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{KEDRec-LM}, an instruction-tuned LLM which distills knowledge from rich medical knowledge corpus for drug recommendation and rationale generation. To encourage further research in this area, we will publicly release\footnote{A copy is attached with this submission} both the dataset and KEDRec-LM.

### Sparse Auto-Encoder Interprets Linguistic Features in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yi Jing, Zijun Yao, Lingxu Ran, Hongzhu Guo, Xiaozhi Wang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:16:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks that require complex linguistic abilities, such as reference disambiguation and metaphor recognition/generation. Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Previous work on linguistic mechanisms has been limited by coarse granularity, insufficient causal analysis, and a narrow focus. In this study, we present a systematic and comprehensive causal investigation using sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). We extract a wide range of linguistic features from six dimensions: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We extract, evaluate, and intervene on these features by constructing minimal contrast datasets and counterfactual sentence datasets. We introduce two indices-Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) and Feature Intervention Confidence (FIC)-to measure the ability of linguistic features to capture and control linguistic phenomena. Our results reveal inherent representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs and demonstrate the potential for controlling model outputs. This work provides strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.

### Thinking Slow, Fast: Scaling Inference Compute with Distilled Reasoners
**Authors**: Daniele Paliotta, Junxiong Wang, Matteo Pagliardini, Kevin Y. Li, Aviv Bick, J. Zico Kolter, Albert Gu, François Fleuret, Tri Dao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T18:08:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements have demonstrated that the performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly enhanced by scaling computational resources at test time. A common strategy involves generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories and aggregating their outputs through various selection mechanisms. This raises a fundamental question: can models with lower complexity leverage their superior generation throughput to outperform similarly sized Transformers for a fixed computational budget? To address this question and overcome the lack of strong subquadratic reasoners, we distill pure and hybrid Mamba models from pretrained Transformers. Trained on only 8 billion tokens, our distilled models show strong performance and scaling on mathematical reasoning datasets while being much faster at inference for large batches and long sequences. Despite the zero-shot performance hit due to distillation, both pure and hybrid Mamba models can scale their coverage and accuracy performance past their Transformer teacher models under fixed time budgets, opening a new direction for scaling inference compute.

**Summary**: Clinical decision-making depends on expert reasoning, which is guided by standardized, evidence-based guidelines. However, translating these guidelines into automated clinical decision support systems risks inaccuracy and importantly, loss of nuance. We share an application architecture, the Large Language Expert (LLE), that combines the flexibility and power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the interpretability, explainability, and reliability of Expert Systems. LLMs help address key challenges of Expert Systems, such as integrating and codifying knowledge, and data normalization. Conversely, an Expert System-like approach helps overcome challenges with LLMs, including hallucinations, atomic and inexpensive updates, and testability.   To highlight the power of the Large Language Expert (LLE) system, we built an LLE to assist with the workup of patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Timely initiation of cancer treatment is critical for optimal patient outcomes. However, increasing complexity in diagnostic recommendations has made it difficult for primary care physicians to ensure their patients have completed the necessary workup before their first visit with an oncologist. As with many real-world clinical tasks, these workups require the analysis of unstructured health records and the application of nuanced clinical decision logic. In this study, we describe the design & evaluation of an LLE system built to rapidly identify and suggest the correct diagnostic workup. The system demonstrated a high degree of clinical-level accuracy (>95%) and effectively addressed gaps identified in real-world data from breast and colon cancer patients at a large academic center.

### Long-Context Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Guanzheng Chen, Qilong Feng, Jinjie Ni, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:59:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups. Our analyses reveal that RAPID achieves robust acceleration beyond 32K context length and demonstrates superior generation quality in real-world applications.

### Logicbreaks: A Framework for Understanding Subversion of Rule-based   Inference
**Authors**: Anton Xue, Avishree Khare, Rajeev Alur, Surbhi Goel, Eric Wong

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:49:33Z

**Summary**: We study how to subvert large language models (LLMs) from following prompt-specified rules. We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.

### Dual-Polarized Beyond Diagonal RIS
**Authors**: Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:43:42Z

**Summary**: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.

**Summary**: Recent advancements have positioned AI, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), as transformative tools for scientific research, capable of addressing complex tasks that require reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Their exceptional capabilities suggest their potential as scientific research assistants but also highlight the need for holistic, rigorous, and domain-specific evaluation to assess effectiveness in real-world scientific applications. This paper describes a multifaceted methodology for Evaluating AI models as scientific Research Assistants (EAIRA) developed at Argonne National Laboratory. This methodology incorporates four primary classes of evaluations. 1) Multiple Choice Questions to assess factual recall; 2) Open Response to evaluate advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills; 3) Lab-Style Experiments involving detailed analysis of capabilities as research assistants in controlled environments; and 4) Field-Style Experiments to capture researcher-LLM interactions at scale in a wide range of scientific domains and applications. These complementary methods enable a comprehensive analysis of LLM strengths and weaknesses with respect to their scientific knowledge, reasoning abilities, and adaptability. Recognizing the rapid pace of LLM advancements, we designed the methodology to evolve and adapt so as to ensure its continued relevance and applicability. This paper describes the methodology state at the end of February 2025. Although developed within a subset of scientific domains, the methodology is designed to be generalizable to a wide range of scientific domains.

### An exploration of features to improve the generalisability of fake news   detection models
**Authors**: Nathaniel Hoy, Theodora Koulouri

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:26:56Z

**Summary**: Fake news poses global risks by influencing elections and spreading misinformation, making detection critical. Existing NLP and supervised Machine Learning methods perform well under cross-validation but struggle to generalise across datasets, even within the same domain. This issue stems from coarsely labelled training data, where articles are labelled based on their publisher, introducing biases that token-based models like TF-IDF and BERT are sensitive to. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, their application in fake news detection remains limited. This study demonstrates that meaningful features can still be extracted from coarsely labelled data to improve real-world robustness. Stylistic features-lexical, syntactic, and semantic-are explored due to their reduced sensitivity to dataset biases. Additionally, novel social-monetisation features are introduced, capturing economic incentives behind fake news, such as advertisements, external links, and social media elements. The study trains on the coarsely labelled NELA 2020-21 dataset and evaluates using the manually labelled Facebook URLs dataset, a gold standard for generalisability. Results highlight the limitations of token-based models trained on biased data and contribute to the scarce evidence on LLMs like LLaMa in this field. Findings indicate that stylistic and social-monetisation features offer more generalisable predictions than token-based methods and LLMs. Statistical and permutation feature importance analyses further reveal their potential to enhance performance and mitigate dataset biases, providing a path forward for improving fake news detection.

### LeanProgress: Guiding Search for Neural Theorem Proving via Proof   Progress Prediction
**Authors**: Suozhi Huang, Peiyang Song, Robert Joseph George, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:26:11Z

**Summary**: Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.1\% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8\% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.2\%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.

### Judge a Book by its Cover: Investigating Multi-Modal LLMs for Multi-Page   Handwritten Document Transcription
**Authors**: Benjamin Gutteridge, Matthew Thomas Jackson, Toni Kukurin, Xiaowen Dong

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:21:18Z

**Summary**: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) remains a challenging task, particularly for multi-page documents where pages share common formatting and contextual features. While modern optical character recognition (OCR) engines are proficient with printed text, their performance on handwriting is limited, often requiring costly labeled data for fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for transcribing multi-page handwritten documents in a zero-shot setting. We investigate various configurations of commercial OCR engines and MLLMs, utilizing the latter both as end-to-end transcribers and as post-processors, with and without image components. We propose a novel method, '+first page', which enhances MLLM transcription by providing the OCR output of the entire document along with just the first page image. This approach leverages shared document features without incurring the high cost of processing all images. Experiments on a multi-page version of the IAM Handwriting Database demonstrate that '+first page' improves transcription accuracy, balances cost with performance, and even enhances results on out-of-sample text by extrapolating formatting and OCR error patterns from a single page.

### BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological   Pathway Reasoning
**Authors**: Haiteng Zhao, Chang Ma, Fangzhi Xu, Lingpeng Kong, Zhi-Hong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:17:08Z

**Summary**: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:15:49Z

**Summary**: Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics and can be accessed here: https://github.com/ServiceNow/insight-bench.

### Conformal Tail Risk Control for Large Language Model Alignment
**Authors**: Catherine Yu-Chi Chen, Jingyan Shen, Zhun Deng, Lihua Lei

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:10:54Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread usage for various tasks. The prevalence of LLMs in society implores the assurance on the reliability of their performance. In particular, risk-sensitive applications demand meticulous attention to unexpectedly poor outcomes, i.e., tail events, for instance, toxic answers, humiliating language, and offensive outputs. Due to the costly nature of acquiring human annotations, general-purpose scoring models have been created to automate the process of quantifying these tail events. This phenomenon introduces potential human-machine misalignment between the respective scoring mechanisms. In this work, we present a lightweight calibration framework for blackbox models that ensures the alignment of humans and machines with provable guarantees. Our framework provides a rigorous approach to controlling any distortion risk measure that is characterized by a weighted average of quantiles of the loss incurred by the LLM with high confidence. The theoretical foundation of our method relies on the connection between conformal risk control and a traditional family of statistics, i.e., L-statistics. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments that address the issue of human-machine misalignment.

### Evaluating Human Trust in LLM-Based Planners: A Preliminary Study
**Authors**: Shenghui Chen, Yunhao Yang, Kayla Boggess, Seongkook Heo, Lu Feng, Ufuk Topcu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:10:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for planning tasks, offering unique capabilities not found in classical planners such as generating explanations and iterative refinement. However, trust--a critical factor in the adoption of planning systems--remains underexplored in the context of LLM-based planning tasks. This study bridges this gap by comparing human trust in LLM-based planners with classical planners through a user study in a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain. Combining subjective measures, such as trust questionnaires, with objective metrics like evaluation accuracy, our findings reveal that correctness is the primary driver of trust and performance. Explanations provided by the LLM improved evaluation accuracy but had limited impact on trust, while plan refinement showed potential for increasing trust without significantly enhancing evaluation accuracy.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:01:09Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.

### Large Language Models as Attribution Regularizers for Efficient Model   Training
**Authors**: Davor Vukadin, Marin Šilić, Goran Delač

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:55:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead.   Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.

**Authors**: Vedant Das Swain, Qiuyue "Joy" Zhong, Jash Rajesh Parekh, Yechan Jeon, Roy Zimmermann, Mary Czerwinski, Jina Suh, Varun Mishra, Koustuv Saha, Javier Hernandez

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:53:40Z

**Summary**: Client-Service Representatives (CSRs) are vital to organizations. Frequent interactions with disgruntled clients, however, disrupt their mental well-being. To help CSRs regulate their emotions while interacting with uncivil clients, we designed Care-Pilot, an LLM-powered assistant, and evaluated its efficacy, perception, and use. Our comparative analyses between 665 human and Care-Pilot-generated support messages highlight Care-Pilot's ability to adapt to and demonstrate empathy in various incivility incidents. Additionally, 143 CSRs assessed Care-Pilot's empathy as more sincere and actionable than human messages. Finally, we interviewed 20 CSRs who interacted with Care-Pilot in a simulation exercise. They reported that Care-Pilot helped them avoid negative thinking, recenter thoughts, and humanize clients; showing potential for bridging gaps in coworker support. Yet, they also noted deployment challenges and emphasized the indispensability of shared experiences. We discuss future designs and societal implications of AI-mediated emotional labor, underscoring empathy as a critical function for AI assistants for worker mental health.

**Authors**: Chenxiao Yu, Jinyi Ye, Yuangang Li, Zhaotian Weng, Zheng Li, Emilio Ferrara, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:47:40Z

**Summary**: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning, their ability to simulate human decision-making -- particularly in political contexts -- remains an open question. However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.

### LLM as a Broken Telephone: Iterative Generation Distorts Information
**Authors**: Amr Mohamed, Mingmeng Geng, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Guokan Shang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:46:23Z

**Summary**: As large language models are increasingly responsible for online content, concerns arise about the impact of repeatedly processing their own outputs. Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.

### AIR: Complex Instruction Generation via Automatic Iterative Refinement
**Authors**: Wei Liu, Yancheng He, Hui Huang, Chengwei Hu, Jiaheng Liu, Shilong Li, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:42:10Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models, their ability to follow simple instructions has significantly improved. However, adhering to complex instructions remains a major challenge. Current approaches to generating complex instructions are often irrelevant to the current instruction requirements or suffer from limited scalability and diversity. Moreover, methods such as back-translation, while effective for simple instruction generation, fail to leverage the rich contents and structures in large web corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic iterative refinement framework to generate complex instructions with constraints, which not only better reflects the requirements of real scenarios but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. The AIR framework consists of two stages: (1)Generate an initial instruction from a document; (2)Iteratively refine instructions with LLM-as-judge guidance by comparing the model's output with the document to incorporate valuable constraints. Finally, we construct the AIR-10K dataset with 10K complex instructions and demonstrate that instructions generated with our approach significantly improve the model's ability to follow complex instructions, outperforming existing methods for instruction generation.

### Recommendations by Concise User Profiles from Review Text
**Authors**: Ghazaleh Haratinezhad Torbati, Anna Tigunova, Andrew Yates, Gerhard Weikum

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:36:08Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems perform well for popular items and users with ample interactions (likes, ratings etc.). This work addresses the difficult and underexplored case of users who have very sparse interactions but post informative review texts. This setting naturally calls for encoding user-specific text with large language models (LLM). However, feeding the full text of all reviews through an LLM has a weak signal-to-noise ratio and incurs high costs of processed tokens. This paper addresses these two issues. It presents a light-weight framework, called CUP, which first computes concise user profiles and feeds only these into the training of transformer-based recommenders. For user profiles, we devise various techniques to select the most informative cues from noisy reviews. Experiments, with book reviews data, show that fine-tuning a small language model with judiciously constructed profiles achieves the best performance, even in comparison to LLM-generated rankings.

### Can Large Language Models Detect Errors in Long Chain-of-Thought   Reasoning?
**Authors**: Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Jiaheng Liu, Weixun Wang, Xingyuan Bu, Ge Zhang, Zhongyuan Peng, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Zhicheng Zheng, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:34:04Z

**Summary**: Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:30:42Z

**Summary**: Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, traditional RM training, which relies on response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle prompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response length and format. In this work, we expose a fundamental limitation of current RM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between contextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To address this, we introduce a causal framework that learns preferences independent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique designed to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that our approach successfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward model (RRM). Our RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model trained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to 84.15%. Additionally, we train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM, demonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies, improving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in AlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%.

### Beyond Natural Language Perplexity: Detecting Dead Code Poisoning in   Code Generation Datasets
**Authors**: Chichien Tsai, Chiamu Yu, Yingdar Lin, Yusung Wu, Weibin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:30:00Z

**Summary**: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets. One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior. Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions. Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code. DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision. Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing. Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.

### GreenDFL: a Framework for Assessing the Sustainability of Decentralized   Federated Learning Systems
**Authors**: Chao Feng, Alberto Huertas Celdrán, Xi Cheng, Gérôme Bovet, Burkhard Stiller

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:27:42Z

**Summary**: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborative model training without centralized data aggregation, enhancing privacy and resilience. However, its sustainability remains underexplored, as energy consumption and carbon emissions vary across different system configurations. Understanding the environmental impact of DFL is crucial for optimizing its design and deployment. This study aims to assess the sustainability of DFL systems by analyzing factors that influence energy consumption and carbon emissions. Additionally, it proposes sustainability-aware optimization strategies, including a node selection algorithm and an aggregation method, to reduce the environmental footprint of DFL without compromising model performance. The proposed framework, named GreenDFL, systematically evaluates the impact of hardware accelerators, model architecture, communication medium, data distribution, network topology, and federation size on sustainability. Empirical experiments are conducted on multiple datasets using different system configurations, measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions across various phases of the DFL lifecycle. Results indicate that local training dominates energy consumption and carbon emissions, while communication has a relatively minor impact. Optimizing model complexity, using GPUs instead of CPUs, and strategically selecting participating nodes significantly improve sustainability. Additionally, deploying nodes in regions with lower carbon intensity and integrating early stopping mechanisms further reduce emissions. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive and practical computational approach for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. Furthermore, it offers best practices for improving environmental efficiency in DFL, making sustainability considerations more actionable in real-world deployments.

### FINEREASON: Evaluating and Improving LLMs' Deliberate Reasoning through   Reflective Puzzle Solving
**Authors**: Guizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Hao Zhang, Hou Pong Chan, Chaoqun Liu, Lidong Bing, Deli Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, Yu Rong

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:23:25Z

**Summary**: Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.

### AI Will Always Love You: Studying Implicit Biases in Romantic AI   Companions
**Authors**: Clare Grogan, Jackie Kay, María Pérez-Ortiz

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:16:37Z

**Summary**: While existing studies have recognised explicit biases in generative models, including occupational gender biases, the nuances of gender stereotypes and expectations of relationships between users and AI companions remain underexplored. In the meantime, AI companions have become increasingly popular as friends or gendered romantic partners to their users. This study bridges the gap by devising three experiments tailored for romantic, gender-assigned AI companions and their users, effectively evaluating implicit biases across various-sized LLMs. Each experiment looks at a different dimension: implicit associations, emotion responses, and sycophancy. This study aims to measure and compare biases manifested in different companion systems by quantitatively analysing persona-assigned model responses to a baseline through newly devised metrics. The results are noteworthy: they show that assigning gendered, relationship personas to Large Language Models significantly alters the responses of these models, and in certain situations in a biased, stereotypical way.

### Liquid: Language Models are Scalable and Unified Multi-modal Generators
**Authors**: Junfeng Wu, Yi Jiang, Chuofan Ma, Yuliang Liu, Hengshuang Zhao, Zehuan Yuan, Song Bai, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:08:51Z

**Summary**: We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/FoundationVision/Liquid.

**Authors**: Abdur-Rahman Ibrahim Sayyid-Ali, Abdul Rafay, Muhammad Abdullah Soomro, Muhammad Hamad Alizai, Naveed Anwar Bhatti

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T16:05:40Z

**Summary**: Batteryless IoT systems face energy constraints exacerbated by checkpointing overhead. Approximate computing offers solutions but demands manual expertise, limiting scalability. This paper presents CheckMate, an automated framework leveraging LLMs for context-aware code approximations. CheckMate integrates validation of LLM-generated approximations to ensure correct execution and employs Bayesian optimization to fine-tune approximation parameters autonomously, eliminating the need for developer input. Tested across six IoT applications, it reduces power cycles by up to 60% with an accuracy loss of just 8%, outperforming semi-automated tools like ACCEPT in speedup and accuracy. CheckMate's results establish it as a robust, user-friendly tool and a foundational step toward automated approximation frameworks for intermittent computing.

### MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for constrained field-of-View   multi-robot Exploration in Large-scale environments
**Authors**: Jimmy Chiun, Shizhe Zhang, Yizhuo Wang, Yuhong Cao, Guillaume Sartoretti

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:58:42Z

**Summary**: In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.

### ChineseEcomQA: A Scalable E-commerce Concept Evaluation Benchmark for   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haibin Chen, Kangtao Lv, Chengwei Hu, Yanshi Li, Yujin Yuan, Yancheng He, Xingyao Zhang, Langming Liu, Shilei Liu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:36:00Z

**Summary**: With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in fields such as e-commerce, domain-specific concept evaluation benchmarks are crucial for assessing their domain capabilities. Existing LLMs may generate factually incorrect information within the complex e-commerce applications. Therefore, it is necessary to build an e-commerce concept benchmark. Existing benchmarks encounter two primary challenges: (1) handle the heterogeneous and diverse nature of tasks, (2) distinguish between generality and specificity within the e-commerce field. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{ChineseEcomQA}, a scalable question-answering benchmark focused on fundamental e-commerce concepts. ChineseEcomQA is built on three core characteristics: \textbf{Focus on Fundamental Concept}, \textbf{E-commerce Generality} and \textbf{E-commerce Expertise}. Fundamental concepts are designed to be applicable across a diverse array of e-commerce tasks, thus addressing the challenge of heterogeneity and diversity. Additionally, by carefully balancing generality and specificity, ChineseEcomQA effectively differentiates between broad e-commerce concepts, allowing for precise validation of domain capabilities. We achieve this through a scalable benchmark construction process that combines LLM validation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) validation, and rigorous manual annotation. Based on ChineseEcomQA, we conduct extensive evaluations on mainstream LLMs and provide some valuable insights. We hope that ChineseEcomQA could guide future domain-specific evaluations, and facilitate broader LLM adoption in e-commerce applications.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:29:03Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

### Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic: Disentangling Task-Specific and   Instruction-Following Knowledge
**Authors**: Yan-Lun Chen, Yi-Ru Wei, Chia-Yi Hsu, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Ying Huang, Ying-Dar Lin, Yu-Sung Wu, Wei-Bin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:22:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong task-specific capabilities through fine-tuning, but merging multiple fine-tuned models often leads to degraded performance due to overlapping instruction-following components. Task Arithmetic (TA), which combines task vectors derived from fine-tuning, enables multi-task learning and task forgetting but struggles to isolate task-specific knowledge from general instruction-following behavior. To address this, we propose Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic (LATA), a novel approach that assigns layer-specific weights to task vectors based on their alignment with instruction-following or task-specific components. By amplifying task-relevant layers and attenuating instruction-following layers, LATA improves task learning and forgetting performance while preserving overall model utility. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including WikiText-2, GSM8K, and HumanEval, demonstrate that LATA outperforms existing methods in both multi-task learning and selective task forgetting, achieving higher task accuracy and alignment with minimal degradation in output quality. Our findings highlight the importance of layer-wise analysis in disentangling task-specific and general-purpose knowledge, offering a robust framework for efficient model merging and editing.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:13:07Z

**Summary**: In recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited proficiency in code generation and chain-of-thought reasoning, laying the groundwork for tackling automatic formal planning tasks. This study evaluates the potential of LLMs to understand and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), an essential representation in artificial intelligence planning. We conduct an extensive analysis across 20 distinct models spanning 7 major LLM families, both commercial and open-source. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the zero-shot LLM capabilities of parsing, generating, and reasoning with PDDL. Our findings indicate that while some models demonstrate notable effectiveness in handling PDDL, others pose limitations in more complex scenarios requiring nuanced planning knowledge. These results highlight the promise and current limitations of LLMs in formal planning tasks, offering insights into their application and guiding future efforts in AI-driven planning paradigms.

### The Impact of Unstated Norms in Bias Analysis of Language Models
**Authors**: Farnaz Kohankhaki, D. B. Emerson, Jacob-Junqi Tian, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Faiza Khan Khattak

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:11:54Z

**Summary**: Bias in large language models (LLMs) has many forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. Counterfactual bias evaluation is a widely used approach to quantifying bias and often relies on template-based probes that explicitly state group membership. It measures whether the outcome of a task performed by an LLM is invariant to a change in group membership. In this work, we find that template-based probes can lead to unrealistic bias measurements. For example, LLMs appear to mistakenly cast text associated with White race as negative at higher rates than other groups. We hypothesize that this arises artificially via a mismatch between commonly unstated norms, in the form of markedness, in the pretraining text of LLMs (e.g., Black president vs. president) and templates used for bias measurement (e.g., Black president vs. White president). The findings highlight the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in counterfactual bias quantification.

### MMEvalPro: Calibrating Multimodal Benchmarks Towards Trustworthy and   Efficient Evaluation
**Authors**: Jinsheng Huang, Liang Chen, Taian Guo, Fu Zeng, Yusheng Zhao, Bohan Wu, Ye Yuan, Haozhe Zhao, Zhihui Guo, Yichi Zhang, Jingyang Yuan, Wei Ju, Luchen Liu, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang, Ming Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:10:56Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive cross-modal understanding and reasoning abilities, often assessed through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that include an image, a question, and several options. However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.

### Re-evaluating Open-ended Evaluation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siqi Liu, Ian Gemp, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Nicolas Heess, Marc Lanctot

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:07:47Z

**Summary**: Evaluation has traditionally focused on ranking candidates for a specific skill. Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.

### Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Universal Verification
**Authors**: Allen Schmaltz

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:05:00Z

**Summary**: We solve the neural network robustness problem by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training)-awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution-awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary)-awareness of the softmax function. The resulting sdm activation function provides strong signals of the relative epistemic (reducible) predictive uncertainty. We use this novel behavior to further address the complementary HCI problem of mapping the output to human-interpretable summary statistics over relevant partitions of a held-out calibration set. Estimates of prediction-conditional uncertainty are obtained via a parsimonious learned transform over the class-conditional empirical CDFs of the output of a final-layer sdm activation function. For decision-making and as an intrinsic model check, estimates of class-conditional accuracy are obtained by further partitioning the high-probability regions of this calibrated output into class-conditional, region-specific CDFs. The uncertainty estimates from sdm calibration are remarkably robust to test-time distribution shifts and out-of-distribution inputs; incorporate awareness of the effective sample size; provide estimates of uncertainty from the learning and data splitting processes; and are well-suited for selective classification and conditional branching for additional test-time compute based on the predictive uncertainty, as for selective LLM generation, routing, and composition over multiple models and retrieval. Finally, we construct sdm networks, LLMs with uncertainty-aware verification and interpretability-by-exemplar as intrinsic properties. We provide open-source software implementing these results.

### LongAttn: Selecting Long-context Training Data via Token-level Attention
**Authors**: Longyun Wu, Dawei Zhu, Guangxiang Zhao, Zhuocheng Yu, Junfeng Ran, Xiangyu Wong, Lin Sun, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:50:10Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing need for significant advancements in handling long contexts. To enhance long-context capabilities, constructing high-quality training data with long-range dependencies is crucial. Existing methods to select long-context data often rely on sentence-level analysis, which can be greatly optimized in both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel token-level framework, LongAttn, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the long-range dependencies for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies long-range dependencies, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. We filter LongABC-32K from open-source long-context datasets (ArXiv, Book, and Code). Through our comprehensive experiments, LongAttn has demonstrated its excellent effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency. To facilitate future research in long-context data, we released our code and the high-quality long-context training data LongABC-32K.

### Geometry and Mechanics of Non-Euclidean Curved-Crease Origami
**Authors**: Zhixuan Wen, Tian Yu, Fan Feng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:38:17Z

**Summary**: Recently there have been extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental works on curved-fold origami. However, we notice that a unified and complete geometric framework for describing the geometry and mechanics of curved-fold origami, especially those with nontrivial Gaussian curvature at the crease (non-Euclidean crease), is still absent. Herein we provide a unified geometric framework that describes the shape of a generic curved-fold origami composed of two general strips. The explicit description indicates that four configurations emerge, determined by its spatial crease and configuration branch. Within this geometric framework, we derive the equilibrium equations and study the mechanical response of the curved-crease origami, focusing on Euler's buckling behavior. Both linear stability analysis and finite element simulation indicate that the overlaid configuration exhibits a lower buckling threshold. To further capture the large deformation behavior efficiently, we develop a bistrip model based on the anisotropic Kirchhoff rod theory, which predicts the main features successfully. This work bridges the geometry and mechanics of curved-crease origami, offering insights for applications in robotics, actuators, and deployable space structures.

### Robust sensitivity control in digital pathology via tile score   distribution matching
**Authors**: Arthur Pignet, John Klein, Genevieve Robin, Antoine Olivier

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:35:47Z

**Summary**: Deploying digital pathology models across medical centers is challenging due to distribution shifts. Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.

### Telephone Surveys Meet Conversational AI: Evaluating a LLM-Based   Telephone Survey System at Scale
**Authors**: Max M. Lang, Sol Eskenazi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:31:42Z

**Summary**: Telephone surveys remain a valuable tool for gathering insights but typically require substantial resources in training and coordinating human interviewers. This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews on scale.   We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training.   Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.

### BoA: Attention-aware Post-training Quantization without Backpropagation
**Authors**: Junhan Kim, Ho-young Kim, Eulrang Cho, Chungman Lee, Joonyoung Kim, Yongkweon Jeon

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:29:08Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices. Early methods developed for smaller networks like ResNet rely on gradient-based optimization, which becomes impractical for hyper-scale LLMs with billions of parameters. While recently proposed backpropagation-free or transformation-based methods alleviate this issue, their performance remains limited by either a lack of inter-layer dependency consideration or the use of naive nearest-rounding-based integer weight assignment to save the heavy computational cost of weight optimization. We thus introduce a novel backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that optimizes integer weights by considering inter-layer dependencies. The key innovation is the development of attention-aware Hessian matrices that capture inter-layer interactions within the attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms existing weight quantization methods but also shows good synergy with conventional methods to suppress activation outliers, leading to state-of-the-art weight-activation quantization performance.

### Finite State Automata Inside Transformers with Chain-of-Thought: A   Mechanistic Study on State Tracking
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Wenyu Du, Dongming Jin, Jie Fu, Zhi Jin

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:24:51Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, and prior research shows that CoT can theoretically increase expressiveness. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. In this work, we (1) evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit, a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state, finding that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model. (3) Additionally, we explore three realistic settings: skipping intermediate steps, introducing data noise, and testing length generalization. Our results demonstrate that Transformer+CoT learns robust algorithms (FSA), highlighting its resilience in challenging scenarios.

### SoRFT: Issue Resolving with Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Zexiong Ma, Chao Peng, Pengfei Gao, Xiangxin Meng, Yanzhen Zou, Bing Xie

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:19:45Z

**Summary**: Mainstream issue-resolving frameworks predominantly rely on commercial models, leading to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing training approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement learning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve 21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B). The experimental results demonstrate that SoRFT significantly enhances issue-resolving performance, improves model generalization, and provides a cost-efficient alternative to commercial models.

### Discovering Antagonists in Networks of Systems: Robot Deployment
**Authors**: Ingeborg Wenger, Peter Eberhard, Henrik Ebel

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:16:22Z

**Summary**: A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.

### Self-Training Elicits Concise Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tergel Munkhbat, Namgyu Ho, Seohyun Kim, Yongjin Yang, Yujin Kim, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T14:14:50Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to utilize additional computation through intermediate tokens to solve complex tasks. However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

**Summary**: Decision-making is a complex process requiring diverse abilities, making it an excellent framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate 13 LLMs from 6 model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $69.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($65.9$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($62.4$). Our code and experimental results are publicly available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/GAMABench.

### LongRoPE2: Near-Lossless LLM Context Window Scaling
**Authors**: Ning Shang, Li Lyna Zhang, Siyuan Wang, Gaokai Zhang, Gilsinia Lopez, Fan Yang, Weizhu Chen, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:41:07Z

**Summary**: LongRoPE2 is a novel approach that extends the effective context window of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to the target length, while preserving the performance on the original shorter context window. This is achieved by three contributions: (1) a hypothesis that insufficient training in higher RoPE dimensions contributes to the persistent out-of-distribution (OOD) issues observed in existing methods; (2) an effective RoPE rescaling algorithm that adopts evolutionary search guided by "needle-driven" perplexity to address the insufficient training problem; (3) a mixed context window training approach that fine-tunes model weights to adopt rescaled RoPE for long-context sequences while preserving the short-context performance with the original RoPE. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3-8B and Phi3-mini-3.8B across various benchmarks validate the hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of LongRoPE2. Remarkably, LongRoPE2 extends LLaMA3-8B to achieve a 128K effective context length while retaining over 98.5% of short-context performance, using only 10B tokens -- 80x fewer than Meta's approach, which fails to reach the target effective context length. Code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/LongRoPE.

**Authors**: Yu Shang, Yu Li, Keyu Zhao, Likai Ma, Jiahe Liu, Fengli Xu, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:33:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a rapid growth of agentic systems capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks. However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community. Code repo is available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentSquare.

### Collab-Overcooked: Benchmarking and Evaluating Large Language Models as   Collaborative Agents
**Authors**: Haochen Sun, Shuwen Zhang, Lei Ren, Hao Xu, Hao Fu, Caixia Yuan, Xiaojie Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:31:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 10 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaption that are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. Environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and an integrated evaluation package are now publicly available at https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked.

**Authors**: Abdul Wadud, Fatemeh Golpayegani, Nima Afraz

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:21:25Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the emerging challenges of conflict detection and mitigation in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). Conflicts between xApps can arise that affect network performance and stability due to the disaggregated nature of O-RAN. This work provides a detailed theoretical framework of Extended Application (xApp)-level conflicts, i.e., direct, indirect, and implicit conflicts. Leveraging conflict graphs, we further highlight how conflicts impact Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and explore strategies for conflict detection using Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) thresholds. We evaluate the effectiveness of several mitigation strategies in a simulated environment with Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) and Energy Saving (ES) xApps and present experimental results showing comparisons among these strategies. The findings of this research provide significant insights for enhancing O-RAN deployments with flexible and efficient conflict management.

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:20:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce Kanana, a series of bilingual language models that demonstrate exceeding performance in Korean and competitive performance in English. The computational cost of Kanana is significantly lower than that of state-of-the-art models of similar size. The report details the techniques employed during pre-training to achieve compute-efficient yet competitive models, including high quality data filtering, staged pre-training, depth up-scaling, and pruning and distillation. Furthermore, the report outlines the methodologies utilized during the post-training of the Kanana models, encompassing supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, aimed at enhancing their capability for seamless interaction with users. Lastly, the report elaborates on plausible approaches used for language model adaptation to specific scenarios, such as embedding, retrieval augmented generation, and function calling. The Kanana model series spans from 2.1B to 32.5B parameters with 2.1B models (base, instruct, embedding) publicly released to promote research on Korean language models.

**Authors**: Mianqiu Huang, Xiaoran Liu, Shaojun Zhou, Mozhi Zhang, Qipeng Guo, Linyang Li, Chenkun Tan, Yang Gao, Pengyu Wang, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:08:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in model architectures and length extrapolation techniques have significantly extended the context length of large language models (LLMs), paving the way for their application in increasingly complex tasks. However, despite the growing capabilities of long-context LLMs, the safety issues in long-context scenarios remain underexplored. While safety alignment in short context has been widely studied, the safety concerns of long-context LLMs have not been adequately addressed. In this work, we introduce \textbf{LongSafety}, a comprehensive safety alignment dataset for long-context LLMs, containing 10 tasks and 17k samples, with an average length of 40.9k tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that training with LongSafety can enhance long-context safety performance while enhancing short-context safety and preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-context safety does not equal long-context alignment with short-context safety data and LongSafety has generalizing capabilities in context length and long-context safety scenarios.

### Continuous Phase-Shifting Holography Utilizing a Moving Diffraction   Grating
**Authors**: G. S. Kalenkov, S. G. Kalenkov, A. E. Shtanko, B. C. Quirk, R. A. Mclaughlin

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T13:02:26Z

**Summary**: Fabrication of optical coherence tomography (OCT) fiber probes in cardiology involves sequentially splicing and cleaving multiple fibers to form a lens. During this process, the splice location-normally invisible under standard illumination-must be identified with micron-level accuracy. This paper presents an approach for splice detection using digital lensless microscopy, which is well-suited for deployment within the restricted space constraints typically found in fiber-fabrication setups. The optical setup incorporates a movable Ronchi grating that simultaneously acts as a beam splitter and a phase modulator. This design enables spatial separation of the reference and object beams while preserving the inherent stability of common-path interferometry. The acquired hologram set is processed using the continuous phase-shifting technique, which is known for its robustness against phase-shifting errors. The theoretical foundations for recording such holograms have been developed, and the conditions under which background noise and the conjugate order are suppressed have been identified. Experiments demonstrated the acquisition of high-contrast quantitative phase images of fiber splices with a spatial resolution down to 1 $\mu m$.

### Say Less, Mean More: Leveraging Pragmatics in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Haris Riaz, Ellen Riloff, Mihai Surdeanu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:55:08Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple, unsupervised method that injects pragmatic principles in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks such as Dense Passage Retrieval to enhance the utility of retrieved contexts. Our approach first identifies which sentences in a pool of documents retrieved by RAG are most relevant to the question at hand, cover all the topics addressed in the input question and no more, and then highlights these sentences within their context, before they are provided to the LLM, without truncating or altering the context in any other way. We show that this simple idea brings consistent improvements in experiments on three question answering tasks (ARC-Challenge, PubHealth and PopQA) using five different LLMs. It notably enhances relative accuracy by up to 19.7% on PubHealth and 10% on ARC-Challenge compared to a conventional RAG system.

### GPT4Image: Large Pre-trained Models Help Vision Models Learn Better on   Perception Task
**Authors**: Ning Ding, Yehui Tang, Zhongqian Fu, Chao Xu, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:49:05Z

**Summary**: The upsurge in pre-trained large models started by ChatGPT has swept across the entire deep learning community. Such powerful models demonstrate advanced generative ability and multimodal understanding capability, which quickly set new state of the arts on a variety of benchmarks. The pre-trained LLM usually plays the role as a universal AI model that can conduct various tasks like article analysis and image comprehension. However, due to the prohibitively high memory and computational cost of implementing such a large model, the conventional models (such as CNN and ViT) are still essential for many visual perception tasks. In this paper, we propose to enhance the representation ability of ordinary vision models on perception tasks (e.g. image classification) by taking advantage of the off-the-shelf large pre-trained models. We present a new learning framework, dubbed GPT4Image, where the knowledge of the large pre-trained models are extracted to help CNNs and ViTs learn better representations and achieve higher performance. Firstly, we curate a high quality description set by prompting a multimodal LLM to generate descriptions for training images. Then, these detailed descriptions are fed into a pre-trained encoder to extract text embeddings that encodes the rich semantics of images. During training, text embeddings will serve as extra supervising signal and be aligned with image representations learned by vision models. The alignment process helps vision models achieve better performance with the aid of pre-trained LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various visual perception tasks for heterogeneous model architectures.

### ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning
**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. Our code has been made available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/ThinK.

### 3D-AffordanceLLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Open-Vocabulary   Affordance Detection in 3D Worlds
**Authors**: Hengshuo Chu, Xiang Deng, Xiaoyang Chen, Yinchuan Li, Jianye Hao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:29:44Z

**Summary**: 3D Affordance detection is a challenging problem with broad applications on various robotic tasks. Existing methods typically formulate the detection paradigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on predefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language, resulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these limitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into \textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task is designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text, which avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the \textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning affordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large language models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed decoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning affordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets for training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general segmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e., \textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to equip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the object-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM obtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM leverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\% improvement in mIoU on open-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.

### Knowledge Localization: Mission Not Accomplished? Enter Query   Localization!
**Authors**: Yuheng Chen, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:29:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the mechanisms behind how they store and express this knowledge remain unclear. The Knowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these mechanisms. This theory is based on the Knowledge Localization (KL) assumption, which suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units, namely knowledge neurons.   However, this assumption has two limitations: first, it may be too rigid regarding knowledge storage, and second, it neglects the role of the attention module in knowledge expression.   In this paper, we first re-examine the KL assumption and demonstrate that its limitations do indeed exist. To address these, we then present two new findings, each targeting one of the limitations: one focusing on knowledge storage and the other on knowledge expression. We summarize these findings as \textbf{Query Localization} (QL) assumption and argue that the KL assumption can be viewed as a simplification of the QL assumption. Based on QL assumption, we further propose the Consistency-Aware KN modification method, which improves the performance of knowledge modification, further validating our new assumption. We conduct 39 sets of experiments, along with additional visualization experiments, to rigorously confirm our conclusions. Code is available at https://github.com/heng840/KnowledgeLocalization.

### Learning Classifiers That Induce Markets
**Authors**: Yonatan Sommer, Ivri Hikri, Lotan Amit, Nir Rosenfeld

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:49:14Z

**Summary**: When learning is used to inform decisions about humans, such as for loans, hiring, or admissions, this can incentivize users to strategically modify their features to obtain positive predictions. A key assumption is that modifications are costly, and are governed by a cost function that is exogenous and predetermined. We challenge this assumption, and assert that the deployment of a classifier is what creates costs. Our idea is simple: when users seek positive predictions, this creates demand for important features; and if features are available for purchase, then a market will form, and competition will give rise to prices. We extend the strategic classification framework to support this notion, and study learning in a setting where a classifier can induce a market for features. We present an analysis of the learning task, devise an algorithm for computing market prices, propose a differentiable learning framework, and conduct experiments to explore our novel setting and approach.

**Authors**: Kadir Burak Buldu, Süleyman Özdel, Ka Hei Carrie Lau, Mengdi Wang, Daniel Saad, Sofie Schönborn, Auxane Boch, Enkelejda Kasneci, Efe Bozkir

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:26:20Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in computer graphics, machine learning, and sensor technologies enable numerous opportunities for extended reality (XR) setups for everyday life, from skills training to entertainment. With large corporations offering affordable consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMDs), XR will likely become pervasive, and HMDs will develop as personal devices like smartphones and tablets. However, having intelligent spaces and naturalistic interactions in XR is as important as technological advances so that users grow their engagement in virtual and augmented spaces. To this end, large language model (LLM)--powered non-player characters (NPCs) with speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) models bring significant advantages over conventional or pre-scripted NPCs for facilitating more natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) in XR. This paper provides the community with an open-source, customizable, extendable, and privacy-aware Unity package, CUIfy, that facilitates speech-based NPC-user interaction with widely used LLMs, STT, and TTS models. Our package also supports multiple LLM-powered NPCs per environment and minimizes latency between different computational models through streaming to achieve usable interactions between users and NPCs. We publish our source code in the following repository: https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/cuify

### MALT: Improving Reasoning with Multi-Agent LLM Training
**Authors**: Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Chandler Smith, Rocktim Jyoti Das, Rafael Rafailov, Ivan Laptev, Philip H. S. Torr, Fabio Pizzati, Ronald Clark, Christian Schroeder de Witt

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:25:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.

### Modern DDoS Threats and Countermeasures: Insights into Emerging Attacks   and Detection Strategies
**Authors**: Jincheng Wang, Le Yu, John C. S. Lui, Xiapu Luo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:22:25Z

**Summary**: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks persist as significant threats to online services and infrastructure, evolving rapidly in sophistication and eluding traditional detection mechanisms. This evolution demands a comprehensive examination of current trends in DDoS attacks and the efficacy of modern detection strategies. This paper offers an comprehensive survey of emerging DDoS attacks and detection strategies over the past decade. We delve into the diversification of attack targets, extending beyond conventional web services to include newer network protocols and systems, and the adoption of advanced adversarial tactics. Additionally, we review current detection techniques, highlighting essential features that modern systems must integrate to effectively neutralize these evolving threats. Given the technological demands of contemporary network systems, such as high-volume and in-line packet processing capabilities, we also explore how innovative hardware technologies like programmable switches can significantly enhance the development and deployment of robust DDoS detection systems. We conclude by identifying open problems and proposing future directions for DDoS research. In particular, our survey sheds light on the investigation of DDoS attack surfaces for emerging systems, protocols, and adversarial strategies. Moreover, we outlines critical open questions in the development of effective detection systems, e.g., the creation of defense mechanisms independent of control planes.

### Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Hao Mark Chen, Fuwen Tan, Alexandros Kouris, Royson Lee, Hongxiang Fan, Stylianos I. Venieris

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:13:19Z

**Summary**: In spite of the great potential of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to their excessive computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as an effective solution by storing weights in reduced precision. However, utilizing low precisions (i.e.~2/3-bit) to substantially alleviate the memory-boundedness of LLM decoding, still suffers from prohibitive performance drop. In this work, we argue that existing approaches fail to explore the diversity in computational patterns, redundancy, and sensitivity to approximations of the different phases of LLM inference, resorting to a uniform quantization policy throughout. Instead, we propose a novel phase-aware method that selectively allocates precision during different phases of LLM inference, achieving both strong context extraction during prefill and efficient memory bandwidth utilization during decoding. To further address the memory-boundedness of the decoding phase, we introduce Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding (PMPD), a technique that enables the gradual lowering of precision deeper in the generated sequence, together with a spectrum of precision-switching schedulers that dynamically drive the precision-lowering decisions in either task-adaptive or prompt-adaptive manner. Extensive evaluation across diverse language tasks shows that when targeting Nvidia GPUs, PMPD achieves 1.4$-$12.2$\times$ speedup in matrix-vector multiplications over fp16 models, while when targeting an LLM-optimized NPU, our approach delivers a throughput gain of 3.8$-$8.0$\times$ over fp16 models and up to 1.54$\times$ over uniform quantization approaches while preserving the output quality.

### Mitigating Unintended Memorization with LoRA in Federated Learning for   LLMs
**Authors**: Thierry Bossy, Julien Vignoud, Tahseen Rabbani, Juan R. Troncoso Pastoriza, Martin Jaggi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:04:13Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative training which avoids direct data exposure between clients. However, data privacy issues still remain: FL-trained large language models are capable of memorizing and completing phrases and sentences contained in training data when given with their prefixes. Thus, it is possible for adversarial and honest-but-curious clients to recover training data of other participants simply through targeted prompting. In this work, we demonstrate that a popular and simple fine-tuning strategy, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), reduces memorization during FL up to a factor of 10. We study this effect by performing a medical question-answering fine-tuning task and injecting multiple replicas of out-of-distribution sensitive sequences drawn from an external clinical dataset. We observe a reduction in memorization for a wide variety of Llama 2 and 3 models, and find that LoRA can reduce memorization in centralized learning as well. Furthermore, we show that LoRA can be combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as gradient clipping and Gaussian noising, secure aggregation, and Goldfish loss to further improve record-level privacy while maintaining performance.

### Erasing Without Remembering: Safeguarding Knowledge Forgetting in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Huazheng Wang, Yongcheng Jing, Haifeng Sun, Yingjie Wang, Jingyu Wang, Jianxin Liao, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:03:33Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we explore machine unlearning from a novel dimension, by studying how to safeguard model unlearning in large language models (LLMs). Our goal is to prevent unlearned models from recalling any related memory of the targeted knowledge.We begin by uncovering a surprisingly simple yet overlooked fact: existing methods typically erase only the exact expressions of the targeted knowledge, leaving paraphrased or related information intact. To rigorously measure such oversights, we introduce UGBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating the generalisation performance across 13 state-of-the-art methods.UGBench reveals that unlearned models can still recall paraphrased answers and retain target facts in intermediate layers. To address this, we propose PERMU, a perturbation-based method that significantly enhances the generalisation capabilities for safeguarding LLM unlearning.Experiments demonstrate that PERMU delivers up to a 50.13% improvement in unlearning while maintaining a 43.53% boost in robust generalisation. Our code can be found in https://github.com/MaybeLizzy/UGBench.

### The Lookahead Limitation: Why Multi-Operand Addition is Hard for LLMs
**Authors**: Tanja Baeumel, Josef van Genabith, Simon Ostermann

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:03:27Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various tasks but struggle with simple arithmetic, such as addition of two or more operands. We show that this struggle arises from LLMs' use of a simple one-digit lookahead heuristic, which works fairly well (but not perfect) for two-operand addition but fails in multi-operand cases, where the carry-over logic is more complex. Our probing experiments and digit-wise accuracy evaluation show that LLMs fail precisely where a one-digit lookahead is insufficient to account for cascading carries. We analyze the impact of tokenization strategies on arithmetic performance and show that all investigated models, regardless of tokenization, are inherently limited in the addition of multiple operands due to their reliance on a one-digit lookahead heuristic. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations that prevent LLMs from generalizing to more complex numerical reasoning.

### Can Textual Gradient Work in Federated Learning?
**Authors**: Minghui Chen, Ruinan Jin, Wenlong Deng, Yuanyuan Chen, Zhi Huang, Han Yu, Xiaoxiao Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T11:03:24Z

**Summary**: Recent studies highlight the promise of LLM-based prompt optimization, especially with TextGrad, which automates differentiation'' via texts and backpropagates textual feedback. This approach facilitates training in various real-world applications that do not support numerical gradient propagation or loss calculation. In this paper, we systematically explore the potential and challenges of incorporating textual gradient into Federated Learning (FL). Our contributions are fourfold. Firstly, we introduce a novel FL paradigm, Federated Textual Gradient (FedTextGrad), that allows clients to upload locally optimized prompts derived from textual gradients, while the server aggregates the received prompts. Unlike traditional FL frameworks, which are designed for numerical aggregation, FedTextGrad is specifically tailored for handling textual data, expanding the applicability of FL to a broader range of problems that lack well-defined numerical loss functions. Secondly, building on this design, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the feasibility of FedTextGrad. Our findings highlight the importance of properly tuning key factors (e.g., local steps) in FL training. Thirdly, we highlight a major challenge in FedTextGrad aggregation: retaining essential information from distributed prompt updates. Last but not least, in response to this issue, we improve the vanilla variant of FedTextGrad by providing actionable guidance to the LLM when summarizing client prompts by leveraging the Uniform Information Density principle. Through this principled study, we enable the adoption of textual gradients in FL for optimizing LLMs, identify important issues, and pinpoint future directions, thereby opening up a new research area that warrants further investigation.

### EEE-Bench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Electrical And Electronics   Engineering Benchmark
**Authors**: Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Tianle Chen, Yuxiang Lai, Konstantinos Psounis

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:54:51Z

**Summary**: Recent studies on large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated promising skills in various domains including science and mathematics. However, their capability in more challenging and real-world related scenarios like engineering has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we propose EEE-Bench, a multimodal benchmark aimed at assessing LMMs' capabilities in solving practical engineering tasks, using electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) as the testbed. Our benchmark consists of 2860 carefully curated problems spanning 10 essential subdomains such as analog circuits, control systems, etc. Compared to benchmarks in other domains, engineering problems are intrinsically 1) more visually complex and versatile and 2) less deterministic in solutions. Successful solutions to these problems often demand more-than-usual rigorous integration of visual and textual information as models need to understand intricate images like abstract circuits and system diagrams while taking professional instructions, making them excellent candidates for LMM evaluations. Alongside EEE-Bench, we provide extensive quantitative evaluations and fine-grained analysis of 17 widely-used open and closed-sourced LLMs and LMMs. Our results demonstrate notable deficiencies of current foundation models in EEE, with an average performance ranging from 19.48% to 46.78%. Finally, we reveal and explore a critical shortcoming in LMMs which we term laziness: the tendency to take shortcuts by relying on the text while overlooking the visual context when reasoning for technical image problems. In summary, we believe EEE-Bench not only reveals some noteworthy limitations of LMMs but also provides a valuable resource for advancing research on their application in practical engineering tasks, driving future improvements in their capability to handle complex, real-world scenarios.

### Deterministic or probabilistic? The psychology of LLMs as random number   generators
**Authors**: Javier Coronado-Blázquez

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:45:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text generation through inherently probabilistic context-aware mechanisms, mimicking human natural language. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of various LLMs when generating random numbers, considering diverse configurations such as different model architectures, numerical ranges, temperature, and prompt languages. Our results reveal that, despite their stochastic transformers-based architecture, these models often exhibit deterministic responses when prompted for random numerical outputs. In particular, we find significant differences when changing the model, as well as the prompt language, attributing this phenomenon to biases deeply embedded within the training data. Models such as DeepSeek-R1 can shed some light on the internal reasoning process of LLMs, despite arriving to similar results. These biases induce predictable patterns that undermine genuine randomness, as LLMs are nothing but reproducing our own human cognitive biases.

### Reference-Based Post-OCR Processing with LLM for Precise Diacritic Text   in Historical Document Recognition
**Authors**: Thao Do, Dinh Phu Tran, An Vo, Daeyoung Kim

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:38:51Z

**Summary**: Extracting fine-grained OCR text from aged documents in diacritic languages remains challenging due to unexpected artifacts, time-induced degradation, and lack of datasets. While standalone spell correction approaches have been proposed, they show limited performance for historical documents due to numerous possible OCR error combinations and differences between modern and classical corpus distributions. We propose a method utilizing available content-focused ebooks as a reference base to correct imperfect OCR-generated text, supported by large language models. This technique generates high-precision pseudo-page-to-page labels for diacritic languages, where small strokes pose significant challenges in historical conditions. The pipeline eliminates various types of noise from aged documents and addresses issues such as missing characters, words, and disordered sequences. Our post-processing method, which generated a large OCR dataset of classical Vietnamese books, achieved a mean grading score of 8.72 on a 10-point scale. This outperformed the state-of-the-art transformer-based Vietnamese spell correction model, which scored 7.03 when evaluated on a sampled subset of the dataset. We also trained a baseline OCR model to assess and compare it with well-known engines. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our baseline model compared to widely used open-source solutions. The resulting dataset will be released publicly to support future studies.

### Collaborative Stance Detection via Small-Large Language Model   Consistency Verification
**Authors**: Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zixiang Tang, Teli Liu, Min Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:30:50Z

**Summary**: Stance detection on social media aims to identify attitudes expressed in tweets towards specific targets. Current studies prioritize Large Language Models (LLMs) over Small Language Models (SLMs) due to the overwhelming performance improving provided by LLMs. However, heavily relying on LLMs for stance detection, regardless of the cost, is impractical for real-world social media monitoring systems that require vast data analysis. To this end, we propose \textbf{\underline{Co}}llaborative Stance Detection via Small-Large Language Model Consistency \textbf{\underline{Ver}}ification (\textbf{CoVer}) framework, which enhances LLM utilization via context-shared batch reasoning and logical verification between LLM and SLM. Specifically, instead of processing each text individually, CoVer processes texts batch-by-batch, obtaining stance predictions and corresponding explanations via LLM reasoning in a shared context. Then, to exclude the bias caused by context noises, CoVer introduces the SLM for logical consistency verification. Finally, texts that repeatedly exhibit low logical consistency are classified using consistency-weighted aggregation of prior LLM stance predictions. Our experiments show that CoVer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, achieving 0.54 LLM queries per tweet while significantly enhancing performance. Our CoVer offers a more practical solution for LLM deploying for social media stance detection.

### GeoEdit: Geometric Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yujie Feng, Liming Zhan, Zexin Lu, Yongxin Xu, Xu Chu, Yasha Wang, Jiannong Cao, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:27:48Z

**Summary**: Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Following the Autoregressive Nature of LLM Embeddings via Compression   and Alignment
**Authors**: Jingcheng Deng, Zhongtao Jiang, Liang Pang, Liwei Chen, Kun Xu, Zihao Wei, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:26:26Z

**Summary**: A new trend uses LLMs as dense text encoders via contrastive learning. However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.

### Identifying and Mitigating Social Bias Knowledge in Language Models
**Authors**: Ruizhe Chen, Yichen Li, Jianfei Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T10:11:06Z

**Summary**: Generating fair and accurate predictions plays a pivotal role in deploying large language models (LLMs) in the real world. However, existing debiasing methods inevitably generate unfair or incorrect predictions as they are designed and evaluated to achieve parity across different social groups but leave aside individual commonsense facts, resulting in modified knowledge that elicits unreasonable or undesired predictions. In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation benchmark, BiaScope, which systematically assesses performance by leveraging newly constructed datasets and metrics on knowledge retention and generalization. Then, we propose a novel debiasing approach, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables fine-grained calibration of individual social biases. FAST identifies the decisive layer responsible for storing social biases and then calibrates its outputs by integrating a small modular network, considering both bias mitigation and knowledge-preserving demands. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with superior debiasing performance while not compromising the overall model capability for knowledge retention and downstream predictions. This highlights the potential of fine-grained debiasing strategies to achieve fairness in LLMs.

### RIS-Aided Positioning Under Adverse Conditions: Interference from   Unauthorized RIS
**Authors**: Mengting Li, Hui Chen, Alireza Pourafzal, Henk Wymeersch

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:56:55Z

**Summary**: Positioning technology, which aims to determine the geometric information of a device in a global coordinate, is a key component in integrated sensing and communication systems. In addition to traditional active anchor-based positioning systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have shown great potential for enhancing system performance. However, their ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves and ease of deployment pose potential risks, as unauthorized RIS may be intentionally introduced to jeopardize the positioning service. Such an unauthorized RIS can cause unexpected interference in the original localization system, distorting the transmitted signals, and leading to degraded positioning accuracy. In this work, we investigate the scenario of RIS-aided positioning in the presence of interference from an unauthorized RIS. Theoretical lower bounds are employed to analyze the impact of unauthorized RIS on channel parameter estimation and positioning accuracy. Several codebook design strategies for unauthorized RIS are evaluated, and various system arrangements are discussed. The simulation results show that an unauthorized RIS path with a high channel gain or a delay similar to that of legitimate RIS paths leads to poor positioning performance. Furthermore, unauthorized RIS generates more effective interference when using directional beamforming codebooks compared to random codebooks.

### Meta-Reasoner: Dynamic Guidance for Optimized Inference-time Reasoning   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuan Sui, Yufei He, Tri Cao, Simeng Han, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:40:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on prolonged reasoning chains to solve complex tasks. However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to "think about how to think." Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs "contextual multi-armed bandits" to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress, and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.

### Picking the Cream of the Crop: Visual-Centric Data Selection with   Collaborative Agents
**Authors**: Zhenyu Liu, Yunxin Li, Baotian Hu, Wenhan Luo, Yaowei Wang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:37:30Z

**Summary**: To improve Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) ability to process images and complex instructions, researchers predominantly curate large-scale visual instruction tuning datasets, which are either sourced from existing vision tasks or synthetically generated using LLMs and image descriptions. However, they often suffer from critical flaws, including misaligned instruction-image pairs and low-quality images. Such issues hinder training efficiency and limit performance improvements, as models waste resources on noisy or irrelevant data with minimal benefit to overall capability. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{Vi}sual-Centric \textbf{S}election approach via \textbf{A}gents Collaboration (ViSA), which centers on image quality assessment and image-instruction relevance evaluation. Specifically, our approach consists of 1) an image information quantification method via visual agents collaboration to select images with rich visual information, and 2) a visual-centric instruction quality assessment method to select high-quality instruction data related to high-quality images. Finally, we reorganize 80K instruction data from large open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViSA outperforms or is comparable to current state-of-the-art models on seven benchmarks, using only 2.5\% of the original data, highlighting the efficiency of our data selection approach. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ViSA.

### LLM-driven Effective Knowledge Tracing by Integrating Dual-channel   Difficulty
**Authors**: Jiahui Cen, Jianghao Lin, Weizhong Xuan, Dong Zhou, Jin Chen, Aimin Yang, Yongmei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:36:27Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental technology in intelligent tutoring systems used to simulate changes in students' knowledge state during learning, track personalized knowledge mastery, and predict performance. However, current KT models face three major challenges: (1) When encountering new questions, models face cold-start problems due to sparse interaction records, making precise modeling difficult; (2) Traditional models only use historical interaction records for student personalization modeling, unable to accurately track individual mastery levels, resulting in unclear personalized modeling; (3) The decision-making process is opaque to educators, making it challenging for them to understand model judgments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-channel Difficulty-aware Knowledge Tracing (DDKT) framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for subjective difficulty assessment, while integrating difficulty bias-aware algorithms and student mastery algorithms for precise difficulty measurement. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) Difficulty Balance Perception Sequence (DBPS) - students' subjective perceptions combined with objective difficulty, measuring gaps between LLM-assessed difficulty, mathematical-statistical difficulty, and students' subjective perceived difficulty through attention mechanisms; (2) Difficulty Mastery Ratio (DMR) - precise modeling of student mastery levels through different difficulty zones; (3) Knowledge State Update Mechanism - implementing personalized knowledge acquisition through gated networks and updating student knowledge state. Experimental results on two real datasets show our method consistently outperforms nine baseline models, improving AUC metrics by 2% to 10% while effectively addressing cold-start problems and enhancing model interpretability.

### SkipPipe: Partial and Reordered Pipelining Framework for Training LLMs   in Heterogeneous Networks
**Authors**: Nikolay Blagoev, Lydia Yiyu Chen, Oğuzhan Ersoy

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:34:23Z

**Summary**: Data and pipeline parallelism are ubiquitous for training of Large Language Models (LLM) on distributed nodes. Driven by the need for cost-effective training, recent work explores efficient communication arrangement for end to end training. Motivated by LLM's resistance to layer skipping and layer reordering, in this paper, we explore stage (several consecutive layers) skipping in pipeline training, and challenge the conventional practice of sequential pipeline execution. We derive convergence and throughput constraints (guidelines) for pipelining with skipping and swapping pipeline stages. Based on these constraints, we propose SkipPipe, the first partial pipeline framework to reduce the end-to-end training time for LLMs while preserving the convergence. The core of SkipPipe is a path scheduling algorithm that optimizes the paths for individual microbatches and reduces idle time (due to microbatch collisions) on the distributed nodes, complying with the given stage skipping ratio. We extensively evaluate SkipPipe on LLaMa models from 500M to 8B parameters on up to 20 nodes. Our results show that SkipPipe reduces training iteration time by up to $55\%$ compared to full pipeline. Our partial pipeline training also improves resistance to layer omission during inference, experiencing a drop in perplexity of only $7\%$ when running only half the model. Our code is available at https://github.com/gensyn-ai/skippipe.

### Factual consistency evaluation of summarization in the Era of large   language models
**Authors**: Zheheng Luo, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:26:10Z

**Summary**: Factual inconsistency with source documents in automatically generated summaries can lead to misinformation or pose risks. Existing factual consistency (FC) metrics are constrained by their performance, efficiency, and explainability. Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in text evaluation but their effectiveness in assessing FC in summarization remains underexplored. Prior research has mostly focused on proprietary LLMs, leaving essential factors that affect their assessment capabilities unexplored. Additionally, current FC evaluation benchmarks are restricted to news articles, casting doubt on the generality of the FC methods tested on them. In this paper, we first address the gap by introducing TreatFact a dataset of LLM-generated summaries of clinical texts, annotated for FC by domain experts. Moreover, we benchmark 11 LLMs for FC evaluation across news and clinical domains and analyse the impact of model size, prompts, pre-training and fine-tuning data. Our findings reveal that despite proprietary models prevailing on the task, open-source LLMs lag behind. Nevertheless, there is potential for enhancing the performance of open-source LLMs through increasing model size, expanding pre-training data, and developing well-curated fine-tuning data. Experiments on TreatFact suggest that both previous methods and LLM-based evaluators are unable to capture factual inconsistencies in clinical summaries, posing a new challenge for FC evaluation.

### Order Doesn't Matter, But Reasoning Does: Training LLMs with   Order-Centric Augmentation
**Authors**: Qianxi He, Qianyu He, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Weikang Zhou, Zeye Sun, Fei Yu

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T09:25:50Z

**Summary**: Logical reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and coherent inference. However, LLMs struggle with reasoning order variations and fail to generalize across logically equivalent transformations. LLMs often rely on fixed sequential patterns rather than true logical understanding. To address this issue, we introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on commutativity in logical reasoning. We first randomly shuffle independent premises to introduce condition order augmentation. For reasoning steps, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between steps, which allows us to identify valid reorderings of steps while preserving logical correctness. By leveraging order-centric augmentations, models can develop a more flexible and generalized reasoning process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning performance and adaptability to diverse logical structures. We release our codes and augmented data in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Order-Centric-Data-Augmentation-822C/.

### Beyond the Tip of Efficiency: Uncovering the Submerged Threats of   Jailbreak Attacks in Small Language Models
**Authors**: Sibo Yi, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Qi Li, Jiaxing Song

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:44:04Z

**Summary**: Small language models (SLMs) have become increasingly prominent in the deployment on edge devices due to their high efficiency and low computational cost. While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs).To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts.To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture compression, quantization, knowledge distillation, and so on. We expect that our research can highlight the security challenges of SLMs and provide valuable insights to future work in developing more robust and secure SLMs.

### MMKE-Bench: A Multimodal Editing Benchmark for Diverse Visual Knowledge
**Authors**: Yuntao Du, Kailin Jiang, Zhi Gao, Chenrui Shi, Zilong Zheng, Siyuan Qi, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:21:28Z

**Summary**: Knowledge editing techniques have emerged as essential tools for updating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs), allowing them to correct outdated or inaccurate information without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive MultiModal Knowledge Editing Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing. Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field.

### ETHIC: Evaluating Large Language Models on Long-Context Tasks with High   Information Coverage
**Authors**: Taewhoo Lee, Chanwoong Yoon, Kyochul Jang, Donghyeon Lee, Minju Song, Hyunjae Kim, Jaewoo Kang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:15:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLM) capable of processing extremely long texts highlight the need for a dedicated evaluation benchmark to assess their long-context capabilities. However, existing methods, like the needle-in-a-haystack test, do not effectively assess whether these models fully utilize contextual information, raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation techniques. To thoroughly examine the effectiveness of existing benchmarks, we introduce a new metric called information coverage (IC), which quantifies the proportion of the input context necessary for answering queries. Our findings indicate that current benchmarks exhibit low IC; although the input context may be extensive, the actual usable context is often limited. To address this, we present ETHIC, a novel benchmark designed to assess LLMs' ability to leverage the entire context. Our benchmark comprises 1,986 test instances spanning four long-context tasks with high IC scores in the domains of books, debates, medicine, and law.

### ANPMI: Assessing the True Comprehension Capabilities of LLMs for   Multiple Choice Questions
**Authors**: Gyeongje Cho, Yeonkyoung So, Jaejin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:11:40Z

**Summary**: Multiple-choice benchmarks, consisting of various prompts and choices, are among the most widely used methods to assess a language model's natural language understanding capability. Given a specific prompt, we typically compute $P(Choice|Prompt)$ to evaluate how likely a language model is to generate the correct choice compared to incorrect ones. However, we observe that performance measured using this approach reflects not only the model's comprehension of the prompt but also its inherent biases for certain choices regardless of the prompt. This issue makes it challenging to accurately measure a model's natural language understanding, as models may select the answer without fully understanding the prompt. To address this limitation, we propose a novel metric called ANPMI, which normalizes Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) by $-\log P(Choice)$. ANPMI provides a more accurate assessment of the model's natural language understanding by ensuring that it is challenging to answer a question without properly understanding the prompt.

### Trustworthy AI-Generative Content for Intelligent Network Service:   Robustness, Security, and Fairness
**Authors**: Siyuan Li, Xi Lin, Yaju Liu, Xiang Chen, Jianhua Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:09:23Z

**Summary**: AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have revolutionized content creation. High-speed next-generation communication technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC network services. At the same time, advanced AIGC techniques can also make future network services more intelligent, especially various online content generation services. However, the significant untrustworthiness concerns of current AIGC models, such as robustness, security, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of intelligent network services, especially in ensuring secure AIGC services. This paper proposes TrustGAIN, a trustworthy AIGC framework that incorporates robust, secure, and fair network services. We first discuss the robustness to adversarial attacks faced by AIGC models in network systems and the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of avoiding unsafe and illegal services and ensuring the fairness of the AIGC network services. Then as a case study, we propose a novel sentiment analysis-based detection method to guide the robust detection of unsafe content in network services. We conduct our experiments on fake news, malicious code, and unsafe review datasets to represent LLM application scenarios. Our results indicate that TrustGAIN is an exploration of future networks that can support trustworthy AIGC network services.

### MIND: Towards Immersive Psychological Healing with Multi-agent Inner   Dialogue
**Authors**: Yujia Chen, Changsong Li, Yiming Wang, Qingqing Xiao, Nan Zhang, Zifan Kong, Peng Wang, Binyu Yan

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:04:27Z

**Summary**: Mental health issues are worsening in today's competitive society, such as depression and anxiety. Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.

### The Hidden Risks of Large Reasoning Models: A Safety Assessment of R1
**Authors**: Kaiwen Zhou, Chengzhi Liu, Xuandong Zhao, Shreedhar Jangam, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Dawn Song, Xin Eric Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T08:03:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1, has led to significant improvements in complex reasoning over non-reasoning large language models~(LLMs). However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (4) The thinking process in R1 models pose greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap.

### ConvCodeWorld: Benchmarking Conversational Code Generation in   Reproducible Feedback Environments
**Authors**: Hojae Han, Seung-won Hwang, Rajhans Samdani, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T07:54:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have proven invaluable for code generation, particularly in interactive settings. However, existing code generation benchmarks fail to capture the diverse feedback encountered in multi-turn interactions, limiting our ability to evaluate LLMs in these contexts. To address this gap, we present a set of novel benchmarks that explicitly model the quality of feedback provided to code generation LLMs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we introduce CONVCODEWORLD, a novel and reproducible environment for benchmarking interactive code generation. CONVCODEWORLD simulates 9 distinct interactive code generation scenarios while systematically combining three types of feedback: (a) compilation feedback; (b) execution feedback with varying test coverage; (c) verbal feedback generated by GPT-4o with different levels of expertise. Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast, static version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating the need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong Spearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third, extensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including R1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies significantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient feedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without feedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's ability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns (high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice versa. All implementations and benchmarks will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ConvCodeWorld/ConvCodeWorld
