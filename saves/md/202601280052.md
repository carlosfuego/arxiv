**Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but often incur prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

### HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding
**Authors**: Haowei Zhang, Shudong Yang, Jinlan Fu, See-Kiong Ng, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

**Authors**: KV Karthikeya, Ashok Kumar Das, Shantanu Pal, Vivekananda Bhat K, Arun Sekar Rajasekaran

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:35:03Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Graph Signal Processing with Dynamic Semantic Alignment (AGSP DSA) framework to perform robust multimodal data fusion over heterogeneous sources, including text, audio, and images. The requested approach uses a dual-graph construction to learn both intra-modal and inter-modal relations, spectral graph filtering to boost the informative signals, and effective node embedding with Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Semantic aware attention mechanism: each modality may dynamically contribute to the context with respect to contextual relevance. The experimental outcomes on three benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSEI, AVE, and MM-IMDB, show that AGSP-DSA performs as the state of the art. More precisely, it achieves 95.3% accuracy, 0.936 F1-score, and 0.924 mAP on CMU-MOSEI, improving MM-GNN by 2.6 percent in accuracy. It gets 93.4% accuracy and 0.911 F1-score on AVE and 91.8% accuracy and 0.886 F1-score on MM-IMDB, which demonstrate good generalization and robustness in the missing modality setting. These findings verify the efficiency of AGSP-DSA in promoting multimodal learning in sentiment analysis, event recognition and multimedia classification.

### Exploring Fine-Tuning for In-Context Retrieval and Efficient KV-Caching in Long-Context Language Models
**Authors**: Francesco Maria Molfese, Momchil Hardalov, Rexhina Blloshmi, Bill Byrne, Adrià de Gispert

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:37:02Z

**Summary**: With context windows of millions of tokens, Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can encode entire document collections, offering a strong alternative to conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, it remains unclear whether fine-tuning strategies can improve long-context performance and translate to greater robustness under KV-cache compression techniques. In this work, we investigate which training strategies most effectively enhance LCLMs' ability to identify and use relevant information, as well as enhancing their robustness under KV-cache compression. Our experiments show substantial in-domain improvements, achieving gains of up to +20 points over the base model. However, out-of-domain generalization remains task dependent with large variance -- LCLMs excels on finance questions (+9 points), while RAG shows stronger performance on multiple-choice questions (+6 points) over the baseline models. Finally, we show that our fine-tuning approaches bring moderate improvements in robustness under KV-cache compression, with gains varying across tasks.

### Shift Parallelism: Low-Latency, High-Throughput LLM Inference for Dynamic Workloads
**Authors**: Mert Hidayetoglu, Aurick Qiao, Michael Wyatt, Jeff Rasley, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:31:58Z

**Summary**: Efficient parallelism is necessary for achieving low-latency, high-throughput inference with large language models (LLMs). Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms.   We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism.   Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution.   We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.

### Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection for Efficient Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Zhenyuan Guo, Tong Chen, Wenlong Meng, Chen Gong, Xin Yu, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:31:40Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems by explicitly generating a reasoning trace before deriving the final answer. However, these extended generations incur substantial memory footprint and computational overhead, bottlenecking LRMs' efficiency. This work uses attention maps to analyze the influence of reasoning traces and uncover an interesting phenomenon: only some decision-critical tokens in a reasoning trace steer the model toward the final answer, while the remaining tokens contribute negligibly. Building on this observation, we propose Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection (DynTS). This method identifies decision-critical tokens and retains only their associated Key-Value (KV) cache states during inference, evicting the remaining redundant entries to optimize efficiency.

### RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers
**Authors**: Tianyu Zhan, Kairui Fu, Zheqi Lv, Shengyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T06:37:34Z

**Summary**: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.

### Sequential Operating Simulation of Solid State Transformer-Driven Next-Generation 800 VDC Data Center
**Authors**: Jian Xu, Xinxiong Jiang, Yi Bao, Yuchen Zheng, Xuhui Chen, Qiang Xu, Siyang Liao, Deping Ke, Xiaoqi Gao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T05:27:01Z

**Summary**: Artificial-intelligence (AI) workloads are driving rapid growth in data-center electricity use and rack power density, increasing demand for power-delivery systems that are efficient and robust to fast load transients. Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design. Overall, the work provides a reproducible evaluation workflow and actionable guidance for next-generation AI data centers.

### FP8-RL: A Practical and Stable Low-Precision Stack for LLM Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zhaopeng Qiu, Shuang Yu, Jingqi Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Xue Huang, Jingyi Yang, Junjie Lai

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T05:12:05Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.

### RTeAAL Sim: Using Tensor Algebra to Represent and Accelerate RTL Simulation (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yan Zhu, Boru Chen, Christopher W. Fletcher, Nandeeka Nayak

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T04:49:48Z

**Summary**: RTL simulation on CPUs remains a persistent bottleneck in hardware design. State-of-the-art simulators embed the circuit directly into the simulation binary, resulting in long compilation times and execution that is fundamentally CPU frontend-bound, with severe instruction-cache pressure.   This work proposes RTeAAL Sim, which reformulates RTL simulation as a sparse tensor algebra problem. By representing RTL circuits as tensors and simulation as a sparse tensor algebra kernel, RTeAAL Sim decouples simulation behavior from binary size and makes RTL simulation amenable to well-studied tensor algebra optimizations. We demonstrate that a prototype of our tensor-based simulator, even with a subset of these optimizations, already mitigates the compilation overhead and frontend pressure and achieves performance competitive with the highly optimized Verilator simulator across multiple CPUs and ISAs.

### A New Construction Structure on Multi-access Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Cyclic Multi-Access Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing
**Authors**: Mengyuan Li, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T03:25:46Z

**Summary**: We consider the $(K,L,M,N)$ multi-access coded caching system introduced by Hachem et al., which consists of a central server with $N$ files and $K$ cache nodes, each of memory size $M$, where each user can access $L$ cache nodes in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.

### Sawtooth Wavefront Reordering: Enhanced CuTile FlashAttention on NVIDIA GB10
**Authors**: Yifan Zhu, Yekai Pan, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T02:45:04Z

**Summary**: High-performance attention kernels are essential for Large Language Models. This paper presents analysis of CuTile-based Flash Attention memory behavior and a technique to improve its cache performance. In particular, our analysis on the NVIDIA GB10 (Grace Blackwell) identifies the main cause of L2 cache miss. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new programming technique called Sawtooth Wavefront Reordering that reduces L2 misses. We validate it in both CUDA and CuTile, observing 50\% or greater reduction in L2 misses and up to 60\% increase in throughput on GB10.

### Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T19:29:44Z

**Summary**: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.

### treaming-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Suffix Pruning and Dynamic Decoding
**Authors**: Zhongyu Xiao, Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Yong Luo, Jia Liu, Jie Xu, Han Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T17:36:04Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaoshideta/Streaming-dLLM.

### The Stateless Pattern: Ephemeral Coordination as the Third Pillar of Digital Sovereignty
**Authors**: Sean Carlin, Kevin Curran

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T15:11:13Z

**Summary**: For the past three decades, the architecture of the internet has rested on two primary pillars - communication on the World Wide Web and Value such as Bitcoin/Distributed ledgers). However, a third critical pillar, Private Coordination has remained dependent on centralized intermediaries, effectively creating a surveillance architecture by default. This paper introduces the 'Stateless Pattern', a novel network topology that replaces the traditional 'Fortress' security model (database-centric) with a 'Mist' model (ephemeral relays). By utilizing client-side cryptography and self-destructing server instances, we demonstrate a protocol where the server acts as a blind medium rather than a custodian of state. We present empirical data from a live deployment (signingroom.io), analyzing over 1,900 requests and cache-hit ratios to validate the system's 'Zero-Knowledge' properties and institutional utility. The findings suggest that digital privacy can be commoditized as a utility, technically enforcing specific articles of the universal declaration of human rights not through policy, but through physics.

**Authors**: Zhihao He, Tieyuan Chen, Kangyu Wang, Ziran Qin, Yang Shao, Chaofan Gan, Shijie Li, Zuxuan Wu, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T15:02:01Z

**Summary**: Standard Autoregressive Video LLMs inevitably suffer from causal masking biases that hinder global spatiotemporal modeling, leading to suboptimal understanding efficiency. We propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Model utilizing bidirectional attention to capture bidirectional dependencies. To further tackle the inference bottleneck of diffusion decoding on massive video tokens, we introduce MARS-Cache. This framework accelerates inference by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention, effectively pruning redundancy while preserving global connectivity via anchor tokens. Extensive experiments show VidLaDA outperforms diffusion baselines and rivals state-of-the-art autoregressive models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video), with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising reasoning accuracy. Code and checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/ziHoHe/VidLaDA.

### MEIC-DT: Memory-Efficient Incremental Clustering for Long-Text Coreference Resolution with Dual-Threshold Constraints
**Authors**: Kangyang Luo, Shuzheng Si, Yuzhuo Bai, Cheng Gao, Zhitong Wang, Cheng Huang, Yingli Shen, Yufeng Han, Wenhao Li, Cunliang Kong, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T08:10:25Z

**Summary**: In the era of large language models (LLMs), supervised neural methods remain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for Coreference Resolution. Yet, their full potential is underexplored, particularly in incremental clustering, which faces the critical challenge of balancing efficiency with performance for long texts. To address the limitation, we propose \textbf{MEIC-DT}, a novel dual-threshold, memory-efficient incremental clustering approach based on a lightweight Transformer. MEIC-DT features a dual-threshold constraint mechanism designed to precisely control the Transformer's input scale within a predefined memory budget. This mechanism incorporates a Statistics-Aware Eviction Strategy (\textbf{SAES}), which utilizes distinct statistical profiles from the training and inference phases for intelligent cache management. Furthermore, we introduce an Internal Regularization Policy (\textbf{IRP}) that strategically condenses clusters by selecting the most representative mentions, thereby preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate that MEIC-DT achieves highly competitive coreference performance under stringent memory constraints.

### S$^3$-Attention:Attention-Aligned Endogenous Retrieval for Memory-Bounded Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Qingsen Ma, Dianyun Wang, Yaoye Wang, Lechen Ning, Sujie Zhu, Xiaohang Zhang, Jiaming Lyu, Linhao Ren, Zhenbo Xu, Zhaofeng He

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T05:25:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models are increasingly applied to multi-document and long-form inputs, yet long-context inference remains memory- and noise-inefficient. Key-value (KV) caching scales linearly with context length, while external retrieval methods often return lexically similar but causally irrelevant passages.   We present S3-Attention, a memory-first inference-time framework that treats long-context processing as attention-aligned endogenous retrieval. S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan. This design allows the KV cache to be discarded entirely and bounds GPU memory usage by the scan chunk size.   At generation time, feature co-activation is used to retrieve compact evidence spans, optionally fused with BM25 for exact lexical matching. Under a unified LongBench evaluation protocol with fixed prompting, decoding, and matched token budgets, S3-Hybrid closely matches full-context inference across multiple model families and improves robustness in several information-dense settings. We also report an engineering limitation of the current prototype, which incurs higher wall-clock latency than optimized full-KV baselines, motivating future kernel-level optimization.

### Fast KVzip: Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference with Gated KV Eviction
**Authors**: Jang-Hyun Kim, Dongyoon Han, Sangdoo Yun

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T03:07:54Z

**Summary**: Efficient key-value (KV) cache management is crucial for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet existing compression techniques often incur a trade-off between performance degradation and computational overhead. We propose a novel gating-based KV cache eviction method for frozen-weight LLMs that achieves high compression ratios with negligible computational cost. Our approach introduces lightweight sink-attention gating modules to identify and retain critical KV pairs, and integrates seamlessly into both the prefill and decoding stages. The proposed gate training algorithm relies on forward passes of an LLM, avoiding expensive backpropagation, while achieving strong task generalization through a task-agnostic reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-1M, Qwen3, and Gemma3 families show that our method maintains near-lossless performance while evicting up to 70% of the KV cache. The results are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including long-context understanding, code comprehension, and mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the generality of our approach.

### Athena: Synergizing Data Prefetching and Off-Chip Prediction via Online Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Rahul Bera, Zhenrong Lang, Caroline Hengartner, Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, Rakesh Kumar, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2026-01-24T22:39:07Z

**Summary**: Prefetching and off-chip prediction are two techniques proposed to hide long memory access latencies in high-performance processors. In this work, we demonstrate that: (1) prefetching and off-chip prediction often provide complementary performance benefits, yet (2) naively combining them often fails to realize their full performance potential, and (3) existing prefetcher control policies leave significant room for performance improvement behind.   Our goal is to design a holistic framework that can autonomously learn to coordinate an off-chip predictor with multiple prefetchers employed at various cache levels. To this end, we propose a new technique called Athena, which models the coordination between prefetchers and off-chip predictor (OCP) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Athena acts as the RL agent that observes multiple system-level features (e.g., prefetcher/OCP accuracy, bandwidth usage) over an epoch of program execution, and uses them as state information to select a coordination action (i.e., enabling the prefetcher and/or OCP, and adjusting prefetcher aggressiveness). At the end of every epoch, Athena receives a numerical reward that measures the change in multiple system-level metrics (e.g., number of cycles taken to execute an epoch). Athena uses this reward to autonomously and continuously learn a policy to coordinate prefetchers with OCP.   Our extensive evaluation using a diverse set of memory-intensive workloads shows that Athena consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art coordination policies across a wide range of system configurations with various combinations of underlying prefetchers, OCPs, and main memory bandwidths, while incurring only modest storage overhead. Athena is freely available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Athena.

### A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL
**Authors**: Gal Assa, Moritz Lumme, Lucas Bürgi, Michal Friedman, Ori Lahav

**Updated**: 2026-01-24T09:52:16Z

**Summary**: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed.   It enables cache-coherent, shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with various storage devices using simple loads and stores.   While CXL unleashes unique opportunities, it also introduces challenges of data management and crash consistency.   For example, CXL currently lacks an adequate programming model, making it impossible to reason about the correctness and behavior of systems on top.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs over CXL.   We propose a high-level abstraction for memory accesses and formally define operational semantics.   We demonstrate that CXL0 captures a wide range of current and future CXL setups and perform initial measurements on real hardware.   To illustrate the usefulness of CXL0, we present a general transformation that enhances any linearizable concurrent algorithm with durability in a distributed partial-crash setting.   We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and programming on top of CXL.

### PocketGS: On-Device Training of 3D Gaussian Splatting for High Perceptual Modeling
**Authors**: Wenzhi Guo, Guangchi Fang, Shu Yang, Bing Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-24T07:58:53Z

**Summary**: Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.

### On Fine-Grained I/O Complexity of Attention Backward Passes
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Song Yue, Jiahao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T18:42:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional proficiency in handling extensive context windows in natural language. Nevertheless, the quadratic scaling of attention computation relative to sequence length creates substantial efficiency bottlenecks, necessitating the development of I/O-optimized algorithms. In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the I/O complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, with a specific emphasis on the backward pass under both small and large cache settings. By leveraging the red-blue pebble game framework, we derive tight bounds for I/O complexity across the full spectrum of cache sizes. We validate that FlashAttention, one of the current industry standards, achieves optimality in the large-cache scenario for both forward and backward passes. Conversely, for small-cache environments, we introduce a novel algorithm that outperforms contemporary methods and successfully attains theoretical tight bounds. Furthermore, we expand our investigation to include sparse attention by establishing granular lower bounds for both forward and backward passes across all cache configurations. Ultimately, our results solidify the theoretical framework regarding I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, providing critical guidance for the development of efficient LLM training and inference systems.

### Bright and pure single-photon source in a silicon chip by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a microcavity
**Authors**: Baptiste Lefaucher, Yoann Baron, Jean-Baptiste Jager, Vincent Calvo, Christian Elsässer, Giuliano Coppola, Frédéric Mazen, Sébastien Kerdilès, Félix Cache, Anaïs Dréau, Jean-Michel Gérard

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T12:02:59Z

**Summary**: We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. By Purcell enhancement of zero-phonon emission, we obtain a photon count rate of $1.29 \pm 0.01$ Mcounts/s at saturation under above-gap continuous-wave excitation with a Debye-Waller factor of $98.6\pm1.4 \%$. A clean photon antibunching behavior is observed up to pump powers ensuring saturation of the W's emission ($g^{(2)}(0)=0.06\pm0.02$ at $P=9.2P_{sat}$), evidencing that the density of additional parasitic fluorescent defects is very low. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with $93\pm2 \%$ purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.

**Authors**: Vishnu Raj, Gouthaman KV, Shiv Gehlot, Lars Villemoes, Arijit Biswas

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T11:07:08Z

**Summary**: We present GMLv2, a reference-based model designed for the prediction of subjective audio quality as measured by MUSHRA scores. GMLv2 introduces a Beta distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics, such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and development in modern audio coding technologies.

### Visual Autoregressive Transformers Must Use $Ω(n^2 d)$ Memory
**Authors**: Yang Cao, Xiaoyu Li, Yekun Ke, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T06:05:15Z

**Summary**: A fundamental challenge in Visual Autoregressive models is the substantial memory overhead required during inference to store previously generated representations. Despite various attempts to mitigate this issue through compression techniques, prior works have not explicitly formalized the problem of KV-cache compression in this context. In this work, we take the first step in formally defining the KV-cache compression problem for Visual Autoregressive transformers. We then establish a fundamental negative result, proving that any mechanism for sequential visual token generation under attention-based architectures must use at least $Ω(n^2 d)$ memory, when $d = Ω(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated and $d$ is the embedding dimensionality. This result demonstrates that achieving truly sub-quadratic memory usage is impossible without additional structural constraints. Our proof is constructed via a reduction from a computational lower bound problem, leveraging randomized embedding techniques inspired by dimensionality reduction principles. Finally, we discuss how sparsity priors on visual representations can influence memory efficiency, presenting both impossibility results and potential directions for mitigating memory overhead.

### RevaMp3D: Architecting the Processor Core and Cache Hierarchy for Systems with Monolithically-Integrated Logic and Memory

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T23:08:40Z

**Summary**: Recent nano-technological advances enable the Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration of multiple memory and logic layers in a single chip, allowing for fine-grained connections between layers and significantly alleviating main memory bottlenecks. We show for a variety of workloads, on a state-of-the-art M3D-based system, that the performance and energy bottlenecks shift from main memory to the processor core and cache hierarchy. Therefore, there is a need to revisit current designs that have been conventionally tailored to tackle the memory bottleneck. Based on the insights from our design space exploration, we propose RevaMp3D, introducing five key changes. First, we propose removing the shared last-level cache, as this delivers speedups comparable to or exceeding those from increasing its size or reducing its latency across all workloads. Second, since improving L1 cache latency has a large impact on performance, we reduce L1 latency by leveraging an M3D layout to shorten its wires. Third, we repurpose the area from the removed cache to widen and scale up pipeline structures, accommodating more in-flight requests that are efficiently served by M3D memory. To avoid latency penalties from these larger structures, we leverage M3D layouts. Fourth, to facilitate high thread-level parallelism, we propose a new fine-grained synchronization technique, using M3D's dense inter-layer connectivity. Fifth, we leverage the M3D main memory to mitigate the core bottlenecks. We propose a processor frontend design that memoizes the repetitive fetched, decoded, and reordered instructions, stores them in main memory, and turns off the relevant parts of the core when possible. RevaMp3D provides 1.2x-2.9x speedup and 1.2x-1.4x energy reduction compared to a state-of-the-art M3D system. We also analyze RevaMp3D's design decisions across various memory latencies to facilitate latency-aware design decisions.

### Memory-V2V: Augmenting Video-to-Video Diffusion Models with Memory
**Authors**: Dohun Lee, Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Xuelin Chen, Jong Chul Ye, Duygu Ceylan, Hyeonho Jeong

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T19:59:17Z

**Summary**: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Space Filling Curves is All You Need: Communication-Avoiding Matrix Multiplication Made Simple
**Authors**: Evangelos Georganas, Alexander Heinecke, Pradeep Dubey

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T19:56:16Z

**Summary**: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is the cornerstone of Deep Learning and HPC workloads; accordingly, academia and industry have heavily optimized this kernel. Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance "glass jaws". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes.

### SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems
**Authors**: Varun Chillara, Dylan Kline, Christopher Alvares, Evan Wooten, Huan Yang, Shlok Khetan, Cade Bauer, Tré Guillory, Tanishka Shah, Yashodhara Dhariwal, Volodymyr Pavlov, George Popstefanov

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T19:42:21Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.   We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.   The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

### FlashMoE: Reducing SSD I/O Bottlenecks via ML-Based Cache Replacement for Mixture-of-Experts Inference on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Byeongju Kim, Jungwan Lee, Donghyeon Han, Hoi-Jun Yoo, Sangyeob Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T17:07:33Z

**Summary**: Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained attention for efficiently scaling large language models. Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems.

### Attacks on Approximate Caches in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Desen Sun, Shuncheng Jie, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T14:44:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce images and other content from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the security vulnerabilities introduced by approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the approximate cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache system and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the approximate cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts from hits. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, leading to unexpected logo rendering for the requests that hit the poisoned cache prompts. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, demonstrating severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching. The code for this work is available.

### Evaluating Compiler Optimization Impacts on zkVM Performance
**Authors**: Thomas Gassmann, Stefanos Chaliasos, Thodoris Sotiropoulos, Zhendong Su

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T10:25:30Z

**Summary**: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits. However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their impact on proof generation is questionable.   We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance (over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average +4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains. Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and superoptimizers.

### Event-VStream: Event-Driven Real-Time Understanding for Long Video Streams
**Authors**: Zhenghui Guo, Yuanbin Man, Junyuan Sheng, Bowen Lin, Ahmed Ahmed, Bo Jiang, Boyuan Zhang, Miao Yin, Sian Jin, Omprakash Gnawal, Chengming Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T05:05:53Z

**Summary**: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

### Side-Channel Attacks on Open vSwitch
**Authors**: Daewoo Kim, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T04:12:03Z

**Summary**: Virtualization is widely adopted in cloud systems to manage resource sharing among users. A virtualized environment usually deploys a virtual switch within the host system to enable virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the physical network. The Open vSwitch (OVS) is one of the most popular software-based virtual switches. It maintains a cache hierarchy to accelerate packet forwarding from the host to virtual machines. We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches. Second, we present a novel header recovery attack that leaks a remote user's packet header fields, breaking the confidentiality guarantees from the system. Third, we demonstrate a remote packet rate monitoring attack that recovers the packet rate of a remote victim. To defend against these attacks, we also discuss and evaluate mitigation solutions.

### UniAttn: Reducing Inference Costs via Softmax Unification for Post-Training LLMs
**Authors**: Yizhe Xiong, Wei Huang, Xin Ye, Hui Chen, Zijia Lin, Haoran Lian, Zhenpeng Su, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T02:27:45Z

**Summary**: Post-training is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world applications. Deploying post-trained models faces significant challenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency. Existing work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed efficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV sharing. However, these methods still result in high inference time overhead, remaining suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In this paper, we identify that the \texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary bottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant during post-training. We propose Softmax \textbf{Uni}fication in \textbf{Att}e\textbf{n}tion (\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method that unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM inference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate for the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn matches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing inference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during post-training.

### R-KV: Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Zefan Cai, Wen Xiao, Hanshi Sun, Cheng Luo, Yikai Zhang, Ke Wan, Yucheng Li, Yeyang Zhou, Li-Wen Chang, Jiuxiang Gu, Zhen Dong, Anima Anandkumar, Abedelkadir Asi, Junjie Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T01:31:36Z

**Summary**: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.

### VibeTensor: System Software for Deep Learning, Fully Generated by AI Agents
**Authors**: Bing Xu, Terry Chen, Fengzhe Zhou, Tianqi Chen, Yangqing Jia, Vinod Grover, Haicheng Wu, Wei Liu, Craig Wittenbrink, Wen-mei Hwu, Roger Bringmann, Ming-Yu Liu, Luis Ceze, Michael Lightstone, Humphrey Shi

**Updated**: 2026-01-21T19:29:00Z

**Summary**: VIBETENSOR is an open-source research system software stack for deep learning, generated by LLM-powered coding agents under high-level human guidance. In this paper, "fully generated" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support. Finally, we discuss failure modes in generated system software, including a "Frankenstein" composition effect where locally correct subsystems interact to yield globally suboptimal performance.

### DeepFedNAS: A Unified Framework for Principled, Hardware-Aware, and Predictor-Free Federated Neural Architecture Search
**Authors**: Bostan Khan, Masoud Daneshtalab

**Updated**: 2026-01-21T16:03:25Z

**Summary**: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

### TIDAL: Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop for High-Frequency VLA Control
**Authors**: Yuteng Sun, Haoran Wang, Ruofei Bai, Zhengguo Li, Jun Li, Meng Yee, Chuah, Wei Yun Yau

**Updated**: 2026-01-21T12:43:11Z

**Summary**: Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.

### Optimizing FaaS Platforms for MCP-enabled Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Varad Kulkarni, Vaibhav Jha, Nikhil Reddy, Yogesh Simmhan

**Updated**: 2026-01-21T07:46:25Z

**Summary**: Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising. This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates. This demonstrates the viability of serverless platforms for hosting complex, multi-agent AI workflows at scale.

### AFLL: Real-time Load Stabilization for MMO Game Servers Based on Circular Causality Learning
**Authors**: Shinsuk Kang, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-21T03:41:03Z

**Summary**: Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game servers must handle thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times. When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV < 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.

### QMC: Efficient SLM Edge Inference via Outlier-Aware Quantization and Emergent Memories Co-Design
**Authors**: Nilesh Prasad Pandey, Jangseon Park, Onat Gungor, Flavio Ponzina, Tajana Rosing

**Updated**: 2026-01-21T00:11:34Z

**Summary**: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

### Understanding Carbon Sourcing and Transport Originating from the Helicon Antenna Surfaces During High-Power Helicon Discharge in DIII-D Tokamak
**Authors**: A. Kumar, D. Nath, W. Tierens, J. D. Lore, R. Wilcox, G. Ronchi, M. Shafer, A. Y. Joshi, O. Sahni, M. S. Shephard, B. Van Compernolle, R. I. Pinsker, A. Demby, O. Schmitz

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T20:52:33Z

**Summary**: The high-power helicon wave system in the DIII-D tokamak introduces new plasma--material interaction (PMI) challenges due to rectified RF sheath potentials forming near antenna structures and surrounding tiles. Using the STRIPE modeling framework-which integrates SOLPS-ITER, COMSOL, RustBCA, and GITR/GITRm-we simulate carbon erosion, re-deposition, and global impurity transport in two H-mode discharges with varying antenna--plasma gaps and RF powers. COMSOL predicts rectified sheath potentials of 1-5 kV, localized near the bottom of the antenna where magnetic field lines intersect at grazing angles. Erosion is dominated by carbon self-sputtering, with RF-accelerated D+ ions contributing up to 1 % of the total erosion flux. GITRm simulations show that in the small-gap case, only ~ 13 % of eroded carbon is re-deposited locally, with 58 % transported into the core. In contrast, the large-gap case exhibits lower total erosion, along with reduced core penetration (~ 35 %) and weaker re-deposition (~ 4 %), consistent with lower collisionality and limited plasma contact. The simulation trends are consistent with experimental observations, which have not shown elevated core impurity levels during helicon operation in the present graphite-wall configuration. However, under certain plasma conditions and magnetic configurations, the helicon antenna may still act as a finite source of net erosion and core-directed impurity transport, potentially influencing the overall core impurity balance. These findings emphasize the need for sheath-aware antenna designs and predictive impurity transport modeling to support future high-power RF systems with high-Z first wall materials in fusion devices.

### Zebra-Llama: Towards Extremely Efficient Hybrid Models
**Authors**: Mingyu Yang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Guihong Li, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T18:39:03Z

**Summary**: With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative: composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models. Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants, respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA, X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers, and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens, over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves 2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

### KeyDiff: Key Similarity-Based KV Cache Eviction for Long-Context LLM Inference in Resource-Constrained Environments
**Authors**: Junyoung Park, Dalton Jones, Matthew J Morse, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T17:55:29Z

**Summary**: We demonstrate that geometrically distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. Based on the phenomenon we propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based solely on key similarity. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We provide a theoretical basis for KeyDiff by relating key diversity with attention scores. These results imply KeyDiff can efficiently identify the most important tokens to retain. Notably KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. Under a strict memory allowance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff for the Llama and Qwen model families by observing a performance gap of less than 0.04% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$23% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on LongBench for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B. We also observe near baseline performance for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on the Math500 reasoning benchmark and decrease end-to-end inference latency by up to 30% compared to the other token-eviction methods.

### Vector Coded Caching Multiplicatively Boosts MU-MIMO Systems Under Practical Considerations
**Authors**: Hui Zhao, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T16:44:59Z

**Summary**: This work presents a first comprehensive analysis of the impact of vector coded caching (VCC) in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems with multiple receive antennas and variable pathloss -- two key factors that critically influence systems with inherent MU unicasting behavior. We investigate two widely adopted precoding strategies: (i) blockdiagonalization (BD) at the transmitter combined with maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receivers, and (ii) zero-forcing (ZF) precoding. Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical considerations such as channel fading, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead, and fairness-oriented power allocation.   Our contributions span both analytical and simulation-based fronts. On the analytical side, we derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput under BD-MRC and ZF, highlighting the performance benefits of equipping multi-antenna users with cache-aided interference management. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity BD-MRC optimization method that leverages matrix structure to significantly reduce the dimensionality involved in precoding computation, followed by solving the associated maxmin fairness problem through an efficient one-dimensional search. In the massive MIMO regime, an asymptotic expression for the achievable throughput over Rayleigh fading channels is also derived. Simulations validate our theoretical results, confirming that VCC delivers substantial performance gains over optimized cacheless MU-MIMO systems. For example, with 32 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas per user, VCC yields throughput improvements exceeding 300%. These gains are further amplified under imperfect CSI at the transmitter, where VCC's ability to offload interference mitigation to the receivers ensures robust performance even in the face of degraded CSI quality and elevated acquisition costs.

### LLMOrbit: A Circular Taxonomy of Large Language Models -From Scaling Walls to Agentic AI Systems
**Authors**: Badri N. Patro, Vijay S. Agneeswaran

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T15:06:19Z

**Summary**: The field of artificial intelligence has undergone a revolution from foundational Transformer architectures to reasoning-capable systems approaching human-level performance. We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations.

### Proactive Coded Caching Scheme for D2D Networks
**Authors**: Qiaoling Zhang, Changlu Lin, Minquan Cheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T13:04:25Z

**Summary**: Coded caching and device-to-device (D2D) communication are two effective techniques for alleviating network traffic. Secure transmission and file privacy have also become critical concerns in these domains. However, prevailing coded caching schemes typically assume that a user's cached content is inaccessible to others, overlooking the risk of file privacy leakage due to attacks targeting the cache itself. In this paper, we propose a secure coded caching scheme for D2D networks that guarantees both file privacy and secure delivery. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves order-optimal performance when the file size is sufficiently large and the cache memory is ample.

### Deferred Commitment Decoding for Diffusion Language Models
**Authors**: Yingte Shu, Yuchuan Tian, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang, Hanting Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T12:30:52Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel text generation. To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding certainty and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a certainty-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.73% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 16.5%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.

### ToolCaching: Towards Efficient Caching for LLM Tool-calling
**Authors**: Yi Zhai, Dian Shen, Junzhou Luo, Bin Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T09:25:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized web applications, enabling intelligent search, recommendation, and assistant services with natural language interfaces. Tool-calling extends LLMs with the ability to interact with external APIs, greatly enhancing their practical utility. While prior research has improved tool-calling performance by adopting traditional computer systems techniques, such as parallel and asynchronous execution, the challenge of redundant or repeated tool-calling requests remains largely unaddressed. Caching is a classic solution to this problem, but applying it to LLM tool-calling introduces new difficulties due to heterogeneous request semantics, dynamic workloads, and varying freshness requirements, which render conventional cache policies ineffective. To address these issues, we propose ToolCaching, an efficient feature-driven and adaptive caching framework for LLM tool-calling systems. ToolCaching systematically integrates semantic and system-level features to evaluate request cacheability and estimate caching value. At its core, the VAAC algorithm integrates bandit-based admission with value-driven, multi-factor eviction, jointly accounting for request frequency, recency, and caching value. Extensive experiments on synthetic and public tool-calling workloads demonstrate that ToolCaching with VAAC achieves up to 11% higher cache hit ratios and 34% lower latency compared to standard policies, effectively accelerating LLM tool-calling in practical applications.

### HeteroCache: A Dynamic Retrieval Approach to Heterogeneous KV Cache Compression for Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Shi, Qibo Qiu, Feng Xue, Zhonglin Jiang, Li Yu, Jian Jiang, Xiaofei He, Wenxiao Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T07:35:06Z

**Summary**: The linear memory growth of the KV cache poses a significant bottleneck for LLM inference in long-context tasks. Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context. Our code will be open-source.

### ContiguousKV: Accelerating LLM Prefill with Granularity-Aligned KV Cache Management
**Authors**: Jing Zou, Shangyu Wu, Hancong Duan, Qiao Li, Chun Jason Xue

**Updated**: 2026-01-20T05:58:19Z

**Summary**: Efficiently serving Large Language Models (LLMs) with persistent Prefix Key-Value (KV) Cache is critical for applications like conversational search and multi-turn dialogue. Serving a request requires loading the pre-computed prefix KV cache and generating the first token, defined as the Re-Prefill Phase. Offloading this shared prefix cache to secondary storage is essential for memory scalability. Re-Prefill with offloading suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks in two aspects. First, semantic-aware KV cache pruning algorithms select important tokens in fine granularity, while systems manage I/O in coarse, fixed-size blocks, causing severe read amplification. Second, the sequential dependency between identifying important tokens and loading KV cache creates idle I/O and compute bubbles, under-utilizing system resources.   This paper proposes \textit{ContiguousKV}, a high-performance prefix KV cache offloading system that bridges algorithmic semantics with I/O efficiency to accelerate the Re-Prefill phase. We first introduce \textit{ContiguousChunk}, a unified data management granularity that aligns KV cache pruning with I/O operations. All the mechanisms critical for I/O performance are performed at the granularity of ContiguousChunk, thereby eliminating read amplification. By exploiting the high similarity in important ContiguousChunk indices across layers, we propose intra- and inter-period asynchronous prefetching to break the sequential dependency between I/O and compute, effectively eliminating idle bubbles. Finally, we propose attention-guided cache management to retain semantically critical prefix data in memory. Evaluations on Qwen2.5 series models show that ContiguousKV achieves a 3.85x speedup in the Re-Prefill phase over the state-of-the-art offloading system IMPRESS, while maintaining high output quality.

### Reduction for Structured Concurrent Programs
**Authors**: Namratha Gangamreddypalli, Constantin Enea, Shaz Qadeer

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T19:23:52Z

**Summary**: Commutativity reasoning based on Lipton's movers is a powerful technique for verification of concurrent programs. The idea is to define a program transformation that preserves a subset of the initial set of interleavings, which is sound modulo reorderings of commutative actions. Scaling commutativity reasoning to routinely-used features in software systems, such as procedures and parallel composition, remains a significant challenge.   In this work, we introduce a novel reduction technique for structured concurrent programs that unifies two key advances. First, we present a reduction strategy that soundly replaces parallel composition with sequential composition. Second, we generalize Lipton's reduction to support atomic sections containing (potentially recursive) procedure calls. Crucially, these two foundational strategies can be composed arbitrarily, greatly expanding the scope and flexibility of reduction-based reasoning. We implemented this technique in Civl and demonstrated its effectiveness on a number of challenging case studies, including a snapshot object, a fault-tolerant and linearizable register, the FLASH cache coherence protocol, and a non-trivial variant of Two-Phase Commit.

### Prompt Injection Mitigation with Agentic AI, Nested Learning, and AI Sustainability via Semantic Caching
**Authors**: Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T16:10:11Z

**Summary**: Prompt injection remains a central obstacle to the safe deployment of large language models, particularly in multi-agent settings where intermediate outputs can propagate or amplify malicious instructions. Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments.

### CORE-T: COherent REtrieval of Tables for Text-to-SQL
**Authors**: Hassan Soliman, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T14:51:23Z

**Summary**: Realistic text-to-SQL workflows often require joining multiple tables. As a result, accurately retrieving the relevant set of tables becomes a key bottleneck for end-to-end performance. We study an open-book setting where queries must be answered over large, heterogeneous table collections pooled from many sources, without clean scoping signals such as database identifiers. Here, dense retrieval (DR) achieves high recall but returns many distractors, while join-aware alternatives often rely on extra assumptions and/or incur high inference overhead. We propose CORE-T, a scalable, training-free framework that enriches tables with LLM-generated purpose metadata and pre-computes a lightweight table-compatibility cache. At inference time, DR returns top-K candidates; a single LLM call selects a coherent, joinable subset, and a simple additive adjustment step restores strongly compatible tables. Across Bird, Spider, and MMQA, CORE-T improves table-selection F1 by up to 22.7 points while retrieving up to 42% fewer tables, improving multi-table execution accuracy by up to 5.0 points on Bird and 6.9 points on MMQA, and using 4-5x fewer tokens than LLM-intensive baselines.

### D2D Coded Caching Schemes for Multiaccess Networks with Combinatorial Access Topology
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T13:12:02Z

**Summary**: This paper considers wireless device-to-device (D2D) coded caching in a multiaccess network, where the users communicate with each other and each user can access multiple cache nodes. Access topologies derived from two combinatorial designs known as the $t$-design and $t$-group divisible design ($t$-GDD), referred to as the $t$-design and $t$-GDD topologies respectively, which subsume a few other known topologies, have been studied for the multiaccess coded caching (MACC) network by Cheng \textit{et al.} in \cite{MACC_des}. These access topologies are extended to a multiaccess D2D coded caching (MADCC) network and novel MADCC schemes are proposed. MADCC network has been studied so far only for the cyclic wrap-around topology. Apart from the proposed novel MADCC schemes, MADCC schemes are also derived from the existing MACC schemes in \cite{MACC_des}. To compare the performance of different MADCC schemes, the metrics of load per user and subpacketization level are used while keeping the number of caches and cache memory size same. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level while achieving the same load per user compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-design topology in \cite{MACC_des}. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of load per user while achieving the same subpacketization level compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-GDD topology in \cite{MACC_des} in some cases. Compared to the existing MADCC scheme with cyclic wrap-around topology, the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of load per user, and the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level at the expense of an increase in load per user.

### D2D Coded Caching from Two Classes of Optimal DPDAs using Cross Resolvable Designs
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T13:04:47Z

**Summary**: Device to device (D2D) communication is one of the most promising techniques for fifth-generation and beyond wireless communication systems. This paper considers coded caching in a wireless D2D network, in which a central server initially places the data in the user cache memories, and all user demands are served through inter-user coded multicast transmissions. D2D placement delivery array (DPDA) was proposed as a tool for designing coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization levels in a D2D network. In this paper, we first constructed three classes of DPDAs using a cross resolvable design, a group divisible design, and a newly developed block design. The resulting D2D schemes achieve low subpacketization levels while meeting the known lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA. These classes of constructed DPDAs either simplify or generalize all existing DPDA constructions that achieve the known lower bound and have low subpacketization levels. Furthermore, a new lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA is proposed. Two new classes of DPDAs are then constructed using a cross resolvable design and a newly developed block design, respectively. These constructions yield low-subpacketization D2D schemes and achieve the proposed lower bound on the transmission load. Compared to existing schemes with the same system parameters as those obtained from the proposed DPDAs, the proposed schemes have an advantage in either transmission load or subpacketization level or both.

### A restricted additive smoother for finite cell flow problems
**Authors**: M. Saberi, A. Vogel

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T12:53:19Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose an adaptive geometric multigrid method for the solution of large-scale finite cell flow problems. The finite cell method seeks to circumvent the need for a boundary-conforming mesh through the embedding of the physical domain in a regular background mesh. As a result of the intersection between the physical domain and the background computational mesh, the resultant systems of equations are typically numerically ill-conditioned, rendering the appropriate treatment of cutcells a crucial aspect of the solver. To this end, we propose a smoother operator with favorable parallel properties and discuss its memory footprint and parallelization aspects. We propose three cache policies that offer a balance between cached and on-the-fly computation and discuss the optimization opportunities offered by the smoother operator. It is shown that the smoother operator, on account of its additive nature, can be replicated in parallel exactly with little communication overhead, which offers a major advantage in parallel settings as the geometric multigrid solver is consequently independent of the number of processes. The convergence and scalability of the geometric multigrid method is studied using numerical examples. It is shown that the iteration count of the solver remains bounded independent of the problem size and depth of the grid hierarchy. The solver is shown to obtain excellent weak and strong scaling using numerical benchmarks with more than 665 million degrees of freedom. The presented geometric multigrid solver is, therefore, an attractive option for the solution of large-scale finite cell problems in massively parallel high-performance computing environments.

### Sutradhara: An Intelligent Orchestrator-Engine Co-design for Tool-based Agentic Inference
**Authors**: Anish Biswas, Kanishk Goel, Jayashree Mohan, Alind Khare, Anjaly Parayil, Ramachandran Ramjee, Chetan Bansal

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T11:26:49Z

**Summary**: Agentic applications are LLMs that iteratively invoke external tools to accomplish complex tasks. Such tool-based agents are rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for deploying language models in production. Unlike traditional single-turn inference, agentic workloads chain together multiple LLM calls and tool executions before producing a final response, creating a new performance bottleneck that manifests as increased latency in First Token Rendered (FTR) of the final answer. Through analysis of synthetic requests at production scale, we reveal three critical challenges: tool calls account for 30-80% of FTR latency, KV cache hit rates collapse despite substantial context reuse across iterations, and sequential orchestration wastes potential intra-request parallelism by sequentially executing LLM calls and tools. These bottlenecks stem from a design gap in which orchestrators and LLM engines operate as decoupled black boxes, preventing cross-layer optimizations. We present SUTRADHARA, a co-designed agentic inference system that integrates orchestration with LLM serving through a thin API enabling three optimizations: overlap tool execution with subsequent LLM prefill using tool-aware prompt splitting, streaming tool execution to dispatch tools incrementally during decode rather than waiting for complete output, and orchestrator-aware cache management that uses semantic hints to improve hit rates and reduce thrashing. Implemented on vLLM, SUTRADHARA reduces median FTR latency by 15% and end-to-end latency by 10% across workloads on A100 GPUs, demonstrating that co-design can systematically tame latency in agentic systems.

### From Prefix Cache to Fusion RAG Cache: Accelerating LLM Inference in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jiahao Wang, Weiyu Xie, Mingxing Zhang, Boxing Zhang, Jianwei Dong, Yuening Zhu, Chen Lin, Jinqi Tang, Yaochen Han, Zhiyuan Ai, Xianglin Chen, Yongwei Wu, Congfeng Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T09:59:39Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances Large Language Models by integrating external knowledge, which reduces hallucinations but increases prompt length. This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention.

### SmallKV: Small Model Assisted Compensation of KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yi Zhao, Yajuan Peng, Cam-Tu Nguyen, Zuchao Li, Xiaoliang Wang, Hai Zhao, Xiaoming Fu

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T09:51:39Z

**Summary**: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

### Sparse ActionGen: Accelerating Diffusion Policy with Real-time Pruning
**Authors**: Kangye Ji, Yuan Meng, Zhou Jianbo, Ye Li, Hanyun Cui, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T09:50:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy has dominated action generation due to its strong capabilities for modeling multi-modal action distributions, but its multi-step denoising processes make it impractical for real-time visuomotor control. Existing caching-based acceleration methods typically rely on $\textit{static}$ schedules that fail to adapt to the $\textit{dynamics}$ of robot-environment interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose $\underline{\textbf{S}}$parse $\underline{\textbf{A}}$ction$\underline{\textbf{G}}$en ($\textbf{SAG}$) for extremely sparse action generation. To accommodate the iterative interactions, SAG customizes a rollout-adaptive prune-then-reuse mechanism that first identifies prunable computations globally and then reuses cached activations to substitute them during action diffusion. To capture the rollout dynamics, SAG parameterizes an observation-conditioned diffusion pruner for environment-aware adaptation and instantiates it with a highly parameter- and inference-efficient design for real-time prediction. Furthermore, SAG introduces a one-for-all reusing strategy that reuses activations across both timesteps and blocks in a zig-zag manner, minimizing the global redundancy. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that SAG achieves up to 4$\times$ generation speedup without sacrificing performance.

### SpecExtend: A Drop-in Enhancement for Speculative Decoding of Long Sequences
**Authors**: Jungyoub Cha, Hyunjong Kim, Sungzoon Cho

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T09:43:38Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is a widely used technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades as input length grows, with significant drops even at moderate lengths. Yet, this early degradation has remained largely underexplored. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves speculative decoding on long sequences without additional training. SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention to accelerate prefill and verification steps. To improve both draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that leverages the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the smaller draft model. Extensive evaluations show that SpecExtend accelerates speculative decoding by up to 2.84x on 16K-token long document summarization and up to 3.86x on long-form reasoning, while preserving the short-input performance of state-of-the-art frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .

### Measurement of Differential Static Polarizability and Frequency of an Inner-Shell Orbital Clock Transition in Lattice-Trapped 174Yb
**Authors**: Yao Yuan, Wang Congyu, Zou Jinpeng, Shi Haosen, Xin Yuqing, Ma Longsheng, Jiang Yanyi

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T09:21:12Z

**Summary**: Additional clock transitions of ytterbium atoms based on inner-shell orbital transition could benefit the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Observation of these transitions with high resolution is a prerequisite for making precise frequency measurements. Here, we observe 4.3 Hz-linewidth spectra of the inner-shell orbital transition at 431 nm in lattice-trapped 174Yb. With high-resolution spectra, we precisely determine the differential static polarizability of the transition to be -2.10(4) kHz/(kV/cm)^2. The magnitude of this polarizability is approximately 1/17 of that of the well-known clock transition in 171Yb at 578 nm, indicating a reduced sensitivity to blackbody radiation. We carry out a frequency ratio measurement between the two clock transitions of ytterbium atoms with an uncertainty of 9E-15. The frequency of the 431 nm transition is determined to be 695 175 030 801 776.5(6.3) Hz. These results represent a step forward in future studies on the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

### Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for Accelerating Talking Head Generation
**Authors**: Jianzhi Long, Wenhao Sun, Rongcheng Tu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T08:05:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

### Batch Query Processing and Optimization for Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Junyi Shen, Noppanat Wadlom, Yao Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T06:41:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows combine multi-step reasoning, heterogeneous tool use, and collaboration across multiple specialized agents. Existing LLM serving engines optimize individual calls in isolation, while multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and fragmented CPU-GPU execution create substantial redundancy and poor hardware utilization, especially in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consolidated graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost model that jointly considers heterogeneous resource constraints, prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU placement, Halo performs plan-level optimization to minimize redundant execution. The Processor integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and migration, along with fine-grained CPU-GPU pipelining to maximize holistic hardware efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to 3.6x speedup for batch inference and 2.6x throughput improvement under online serving, scaling to workloads of thousands of queries and complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality. By unifying query optimization with heterogeneous LLM serving, Halo enables efficient agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

### Cache Your Prompt When It's Green: Carbon-Aware Caching for Large Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Yuyang Tian, Desen Sun, Yi Ding, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T05:40:03Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, their environmental impact, especially carbon emission, has attracted more attention. Prior studies focus on compute-related carbon emissions. In this paper, we find that storage is another key contributor. LLM caching, which saves and reuses KV caches for repeated context, reduces operational carbon by avoiding redundant computation. However, this benefit comes at the cost of embodied carbon from high-capacity, high-speed SSDs. As LLMs scale, the embodied carbon of storage grows significantly. To address this tradeoff, we present GreenCache, a carbon-aware cache management framework that dynamically derives resource allocation plans for LLM serving. GreenCache analyzes the correlation between carbon emission and SLO satisfaction, reconfiguring the resource over time to keep the balance between SLO and carbon emission under dynamic workloads. Evaluations from real traces demonstrate that GreenCache achieves an average carbon reduction of 15.1 % when serving Llama-3 70B in the FR grid, with reductions reaching up to 25.3 %, while staying within latency constraints for > 90 % of requests.

### Transferable Graphical MARL for Real-Time Estimation in Dynamic Wireless Networks
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti

**Updated**: 2026-01-19T02:09:21Z

**Summary**: We study real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in decentralized and dynamic multi-hop networks that share similar structures. Nodes cache neighboring samples and communicate over wireless collision channels. The objective is to minimize the time-average estimation error and/or the age of information under decentralized policies, which we address by developing a unified graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. A key feature of the framework is its transferability, enabled by the fact that the number of trainable parameters is independent of the number of agents, allowing a learned policy to be directly deployed on dynamic yet structurally similar graphs without re-training. Building on this design, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the transferability of the resulting policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on dynamic graphs; (ii) the trained policies transfer well to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of nodes; and (iii) incorporating recurrence is crucial, enhancing resilience to non-stationarity in both independent learning and centralized training with decentralized execution.

### DCAC: Dynamic Class-Aware Cache Creates Stronger Out-of-Distribution Detectors
**Authors**: Yanqi Wu, Qichao Chen, Runhe Lai, Xinhua Lu, Jia-Xin Zhuang, Zhilin Zhao, Wei-Shi Zheng, Ruixuan Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-18T16:16:31Z

**Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly due to overconfident predictions on unseen OOD samples during testing. We reveal a key insight: OOD samples predicted as the same class, or given high probabilities for it, are visually more similar to each other than to the true in-distribution (ID) samples. Motivated by this class-specific observation, we propose DCAC (Dynamic Class-Aware Cache), a training-free, test-time calibration module that maintains separate caches for each ID class to collect high-entropy samples and calibrate the raw predictions of input samples. DCAC leverages cached visual features and predicted probabilities through a lightweight two-layer module to mitigate overconfident predictions on OOD samples. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various existing OOD detection methods across both unimodal and vision-language models while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple OOD benchmarks demonstrate that DCAC significantly enhances existing methods, achieving substantial improvements, i.e., reducing FPR95 by 6.55% when integrated with ASH-S on ImageNet OOD benchmark.

### Rethinking the Value of Multi-Agent Workflow: A Strong Single Agent Baseline
**Authors**: Jiawei Xu, Arief Koesdwiady, Sisong Bei, Yan Han, Baixiang Huang, Dakuo Wang, Yutong Chen, Zheshen Wang, Peihao Wang, Pan Li, Ying Ding

**Updated**: 2026-01-18T08:16:09Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show that workflows composed of multiple LLM agents with distinct roles, tools, and communication patterns can outperform single-LLM baselines on complex tasks. However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

### CD-PIM: A High-Bandwidth and Compute-Efficient LPDDR5-Based PIM for Low-Batch LLM Acceleration on Edge-Device
**Authors**: Ye Lin, Chao Fang, Xiaoyong Song, Qi Wu, Anying Jiang, Yichuan Bai, Li Du

**Updated**: 2026-01-18T07:58:23Z

**Summary**: Edge deployment of low-batch large language models (LLMs) faces critical memory bandwidth bottlenecks when executing memory-intensive general matrix-vector multiplications (GEMV) operations. While digital processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures promise to accelerate GEMV operations, existing PIM-equipped edge devices still suffer from three key limitations: limited bandwidth improvement, component under-utilization in mixed workloads, and low compute capacity of computing units (CUs). In this paper, we propose CD-PIM to address these challenges through three key innovations. First, we introduce a high-bandwidth compute-efficient mode (HBCEM) that enhances bandwidth by dividing each bank into four pseudo-banks through segmented global bitlines. Second, we propose a low-batch interleaving mode (LBIM) to improve component utilization by overlapping GEMV operations with GEMM operations. Third, we design a compute-efficient CU that performs enhanced GEMV operations in a pipelined manner by serially feeding weight data into the computing core. Forth, we adopt a column-wise mapping for the key-cache matrix and row-wise mapping for the value-cache matrix, which fully utilizes CU resources. Our evaluation shows that compared to a GPU-only baseline and state-of-the-art PIM designs, our CD-PIM achieves 11.42x and 4.25x speedup on average within a single batch in HBCEM mode, respectively. Moreover, for low-batch sizes, the CD-PIM achieves an average speedup of 1.12x in LBIM compared to HBCEM.

### Environment-Aware Code Generation: How far are We?
**Authors**: Tongtong Wu, Rongyi Chen, Wenjie Du, Suyu Ma, Guilin Qi, Zhenchang Xing, Shahram Khadivi, Ramesh Periyathambi, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2026-01-18T04:58:15Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has improved code generation, but most evaluations still test isolated, small-scale code (e.g., a single function) under default or unspecified software environments. As a result, it is unclear whether LLMs can reliably generate executable code tailored to a user's specific environment. We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each. Our results show that current LLMs struggle with environment-specific code generation, while our adaptations improve environment compatibility and executability. These findings highlight key challenges and opportunities for deploying LLMs in practical software engineering workflows.

### Super Monotonic Alignment Search
**Authors**: Junhyeok Lee, Hyeongju Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-17T22:13:51Z

**Summary**: Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in text-to-speech to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all possible paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$, where $T$ is the length of text and $S$ is the length of speech representation. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align.

### CAHC:A General Conflict-Aware Heuristic Caching Framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding
**Authors**: HT To, S Nguyen, NH Pham

**Updated**: 2026-01-17T09:48:21Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms, including those for car-like robots and grid-based scenarios, face significant computational challenges due to expensive heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in constraint-based search algorithms (e.g., CBS, MAPF-LNS, MAP2) where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAHC} (Conflict-Aware Heuristic Caching), a general framework that caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context, addressing this fundamental limitation. We demonstrate CAHC through a case study on CL-CBS for car-like robots, where we combine conflict-aware caching with an adaptive hybrid heuristic in \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement). Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a domain-adaptable relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) a modular architecture that enables systematic application to diverse MAPF algorithms. Experimental evaluation on 480 CL-CBS benchmark instances demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances. The framework's general architecture makes it applicable as a reliable optimization technique for MAP2, MAPF-LNS, and other constraint-based MAPF algorithms.

### High-Voltage Performance Testing in LAr of the PMMA Cathode Connection for the DarkSide-20k Experiment
**Authors**: Ludovico Luzzi

**Updated**: 2026-01-17T00:03:03Z

**Summary**: DarkSide--20k (DS--20k) is a next--generation dual--phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct--detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall--C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7~t of low--radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP--nucleon spin--independent cross--section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200~tonne--year run. In DS--20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress--cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS--20k cathode high--voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric--field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS--20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$~kV.

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T22:58:59Z

**Summary**: Two widely adopted techniques for LLM inference serving systems today are hybrid batching and disaggregated serving. A hybrid batch combines prefill and decode tokens of different requests in the same batch to improve resource utilization and throughput at the cost of increased latency per token. In contrast, disaggregated serving decouples compute-bound prefill and bandwidth-bound decode phases to optimize for service level objectives (SLOs) at the cost of resource under-utilization and KV-cache transfer overheads. To address the limitations of these techniques, we propose RAPID-Serve: a technique to concurrently execute prefill and decode on the same GPU(s) to meet latency SLOs while maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Resource Management for runtime compute resource allocation, optionally leveraging CU masking (a fine-grained Compute Unit partitioning feature on AMD Instinct\textsuperscript{TM} GPUs). RAPID-Serve provides up to 4.1x (average 1.7x) unconstrained throughput improvement and 32x and higher (average 4.9x) throughput improvement under SLO constraints, showing it as an effective strategy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

### On Abnormal Execution Timing of Conditional Jump Instructions
**Authors**: Annika Wilde, Samira Briongos, Claudio Soriente, Ghassan Karame

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T18:30:09Z

**Summary**: An extensive line of work on modern computing architectures has shown that the execution time of instructions can (i) depend on the operand of the instruction or (ii) be influenced by system optimizations, e.g., branch prediction and speculative execution paradigms.   In this paper, we systematically measure and analyze timing variabilities in conditional jump instructions that can be macro-fused with a preceding instruction, depending on their placement within the binary. Our measurements indicate that these timing variations stem from the micro-op cache placement and the jump's offset in the L1 instruction cache of modern processors. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent across multiple microarchitectures, including Skylake, Coffee Lake, and Kaby Lake, as well as various real-world implementations. We confirm the prevalence of this variability through extensive experiments on a large-scale set of popular binaries, including libraries from Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 10 Pro, and several open-source cryptographic libraries. We also show that one can easily avoid this timing variability by ensuring that macro-fusible instructions are 32-byte aligned - an approach initially suggested in 2019 by Intel in an overlooked short report. We quantify the performance impact of this approach across the cryptographic libraries, showing a speedup of 2.15% on average (and up to 10.54%) when avoiding the timing variability. As a by-product, we show that this variability can be exploited as a covert channel, achieving a maximum throughput of 16.14 Mbps.

### Low-Rank Key Value Attention
**Authors**: James O'Neill, Robert Clancy, Mariia Matskevichus, Fergal Reid

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T17:56:40Z

**Summary**: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.   LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

### MHA2MLA-VLM: Enabling DeepSeek's Economical Multi-Head Latent Attention across Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaoran Fan, Zhichao Sun, Tao Ji, Lixing Shen, Tao Gui

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T17:45:34Z

**Summary**: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

### Semantic Caching and Intent-Driven Context Optimization for Multi-Agent Natural Language to Code Systems
**Authors**: Harmohit Singh

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T11:32:20Z

**Summary**: We present a production-optimized multi-agent system designed to translate natural language queries into executable Python code for structured data analytics. Unlike systems that rely on expensive frontier models, our approach achieves high accuracy and cost efficiency through three key innovations: (1) a semantic caching system with LLM-based equivalence detection and structured adaptation hints that provides cache hit rates of 67% on production queries; (2) a dual-threshold decision mechanism that separates exact-match retrieval from reference-guided generation; and (3) an intent-driven dynamic prompt assembly system that reduces token consumption by 40-60% through table-aware context filtering. The system has been deployed in production for enterprise inventory management, processing over 10,000 queries with an average latency of 8.2 seconds and 94.3% semantic accuracy. We describe the architecture, present empirical results from production deployment, and discuss practical considerations for deploying LLM-based analytics systems at scale.

### A Construction Framework of Coded Caching Scheme for Multi-Access MISO Systems via Knapsack Problem
**Authors**: Siying Luo, Youlong Wu, Mingming Zhang, Minquan Cheng, Dianhua Wu

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T08:28:13Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the coded caching problem in a multi-access multiple-input single-output (MAMISO) network with the combinatorial topology. The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $Λ$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\min\{L+KM/N, K\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```

### A Low-Complexity Architecture for Multi-access Coded Caching Systems with Arbitrary User-cache Access Topology
**Authors**: Ting Yang, Kai Wan, Minquan Cheng, Xinping Yi, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T03:54:39Z

**Summary**: This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.

### Beyond Max Tokens: Stealthy Resource Amplification via Tool Calling Chains in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Kaiyu Zhou, Yongsen Zheng, Yicheng He, Meng Xue, Xueluan Gong, Yuji Wang, Kwok-Yan Lam

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T02:47:45Z

**Summary**: The agent-tool communication loop is a critical attack surface in modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.

### SwiftKV: An Edge-Oriented Attention Algorithm and Multi-Head Accelerator for Fast, Efficient LLM Decoding
**Authors**: Junming Zhang, Qinyan Zhang, Huajun Sun, Feiyang Gao, Sheng Hu, Rui Nie, Xiangshui Miao

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T02:44:40Z

**Summary**: Edge acceleration for large language models is crucial for their widespread application; however, achieving fast attention inference and efficient decoding on resource-constrained edge accelerators remains challenging. This paper presents SwiftKV Attention, a per-token pipelined, low-latency single-pass attention inference algorithm, where every (kt, vt) in the KV cache is processed exactly once in a uniform per-token pipeline without score materialization, blockwise softmax, or a second pass, thereby enabling fast execution on edge accelerators with a single hardware set and no resource-intensive parallelism. Furthermore, to address the limited support for multi-head LLM decoding in existing accelerators, we design the SwiftKV-MHA accelerator, which enables high precision attention and low precision GEMV on the same processor array, achieving fast and efficient multi-head parallel decoding. Experimental results show that, on the edge accelerator, the SwiftKV Attention algorithm achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention and significantly outperforms other attention algorithms. SwiftKV-MHA further reduces attention latency by 13.48*; under the same settings, it improves generation speed by 17.4% and increases token efficiency by 1.98* compared with state-of-the-art works.

### Multiaccess Coded Caching with Heterogeneous Retrieval Costs
**Authors**: Wenbo Huang, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Xiaojun Li, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-16T02:27:13Z

**Summary**: The multiaccess coded caching (MACC) system, as formulated by Hachem {\it et al.}, consists of a central server with a library of $N$ files, connected to $K$ cache-less users via an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache nodes, each equipped with cache memory of size $M$ files. Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost. By identifying a sparsity property of the optimal solution, we propose a structure-aware algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme consistently outperforms the scheme of Cheng {\it et al.} in scenarios with heterogeneous retrieval costs.

### AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and High-Quality Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Shaoting Feng, Hanchen Li, Kuntai Du, Zhuohan Gu, Yuhan Liu, Jiayi Yao, Siddhant Ray, Samuel Shen, Yihua Cheng, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T21:12:02Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.   However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

### Mugi: Value Level Parallelism For Efficient LLMs
**Authors**: Daniel Price, Prabhu Vellaisamy, John Shen, Di Wu

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T19:48:21Z

**Summary**: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

### RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Eugene Yang, Andrew Yates, Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield, Trevor Adriaanse

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T18:04:43Z

**Summary**: Retrieval models are key components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which generate search queries, process the documents returned, and generate a response. RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking). The API automatically performs asynchronous query batching and caches results by default. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are already supported by the package, RoutIR is also easily expandable by implementing the Engine abstract class. The package is open-sourced and publicly available on GitHub: http://github.com/hltcoe/routir.

### A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle
**Authors**: Yongcheng Yang, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T15:29:03Z

**Summary**: Coded caching is recognized as an effective method for alleviating network congestion during peak periods by leveraging local caching and coded multicasting gains. The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only achieves lower transmission load than existing linear subpacketization schemes but also approaches the performance of certain exponential subpacketization schemes.

### Coded Caching for Combinatorial Multi-Access Hotplug Networks from $t$-Designs
**Authors**: Dhruv Pratap Singh, Anjana A. Mahesh, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T15:21:17Z

**Summary**: We study hotplug coded caching in combinatorial multi-access networks, which generalizes existing hotplug coded caching models by allowing users to access multiple caches, while only a subset of caches is online during the delivery phase. We first generalize the Hotplug Placement Delivery Array (HpPDA) framework to the combinatorial multi-access setting. Based on this generalized framework, we propose a t-design-based coded caching scheme for combinatorial multi-access networks. We characterize a class of design parameters under which every active user has access to a sufficient number of coded subfiles to decode its requested file, and show that appropriate parameter choices allow for the elimination of redundant multicast transmissions. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a family of rate memory trade offs with flexible subpacketization. We present numerical comparisons illustrating that the proposed t-scheme outperforms existing hotplug coded caching schemes in certain memory regimes.

### Placement Delivery Array for Cache-Aided MIMO Systems
**Authors**: Yifei Huang, Kai Wan, Minquan Cheng, Jinyan Wang, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T14:16:01Z

**Summary**: We consider a $(G,L,K,M,N)$ cache-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, where a server equipped with $L$ antennas and a library of $N$ equal-size files communicates with $K$ users, each equipped with $G$ antennas and a cache of size $M$ files, over a wireless interference channel. Each user requests an arbitrary file from the library. The goal is to design coded caching schemes that simultaneously achieve the maximum sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization. In this paper, we first introduce a unified combinatorial structure, termed the MIMO placement delivery array (MIMO-PDA), which characterizes uncoded placement and one-shot zero-forcing delivery. By analyzing the combinatorial properties of MIMO-PDAs, we derive a sum-DoF upper bound of $\min\{KG, Gt+G\lceil L/G \rceil\}$, where $t=KM/N$, which coincides with the optimal DoF characterization in prior work by Tehrani \emph{et al.}. Based on this upper bound, we present two novel constructions of MIMO-PDAs that achieve the maximum sum-DoF. The first construction achieves linear subpacketization under stringent parameter constraints, while the second achieves ordered exponential subpacketization under substantially milder constraints. Theoretical analysis and numerical comparisons demonstrate that the second construction exponentially reduces subpacketization compared to existing schemes while preserving the maximum sum-DoF.

### Toward Ultra-Long-Horizon Agentic Science: Cognitive Accumulation for Machine Learning Engineering
**Authors**: Xinyu Zhu, Yuzhu Cai, Zexi Liu, Bingyang Zheng, Cheng Wang, Rui Ye, Jiaao Chen, Hanrui Wang, Wei-Chen Wang, Yuzhi Zhang, Linfeng Zhang, Weinan E, Di Jin, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T13:52:04Z

**Summary**: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

### A New Construction Structure on MISO Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Half-Sum Disjoint Packing
**Authors**: Bowen Zheng, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T12:57:30Z

**Summary**: In the $(L,K,M,N)$ cache-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) system, the server is equipped with $L$ antennas and communicates with $K$ single-antenna users through a wireless broadcast channel where the server has a library containing $N$ files, and each user is equipped with a cache of size $M$ files. Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.

### Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Yijun Liu, Yixuan Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Shiyu Ji, Yang Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T09:11:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

### LOOKAT: Lookup-Optimized Key-Attention for Memory-Efficient Transformers
**Authors**: Aryan Karmore

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T07:54:07Z

**Summary**: Compressing the KV cache is a required step to deploy large language models on edge devices. Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\times$ compression at 95.7\% output fidelity and 32 $\times$ compression at 95.0\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$. Theoretical analysis confirms that rank correlation degrades as $O(d_k/mK)$, with guarantees validated across sequence lengths up to 1024 tokens.

### Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
**Authors**: Bin Xu, Ayan Banerjee, Sandeep Gupta

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T06:37:21Z

**Summary**: Neural networks have become dominant computational workloads across cloud and edge platforms, but their rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the current technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures, domain-specific accelerators (TPUs, NPUs), FPGA-based designs, ASIC inference engines, and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs, alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the survey using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas such as systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- pointing to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.

### Sparse-RL: Breaking the Memory Wall in LLM Reinforcement Learning via Stable Sparse Rollouts
**Authors**: Sijia Luo, Xiaokang Zhang, Yuxuan Hu, Bohan Zhang, Ke Wang, Jinbo Su, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T05:12:03Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

### Privacy Enhanced PEFT: Tensor Train Decomposition Improves Privacy Utility Tradeoffs under DP-SGD
**Authors**: Pradip Kunwar, Minh Vu, Maanak Gupta, Manish Bhattarai

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T03:41:52Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models on sensitive data poses significant privacy risks, as membership inference attacks can reveal whether individual records were used during training. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal protection, applying DP to conventional Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) often incurs substantial utility loss. In this work, we show that a more structurally constrained PEFT architecture, Tensor Train Low-Rank Adaptation (TTLoRA), can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by shrinking the effective parameter space while preserving expressivity. To this end, we develop TTLoRA-DP, a differentially private training framework for TTLoRA. Specifically, we extend the ghost clipping algorithm to Tensor Train cores via cached contraction states, enabling efficient Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) with exact per-example gradient norm computation without materializing full per-example gradients. Experiments on GPT-2 fine-tuning over the Enron and Penn Treebank datasets show that TTLoRA-DP consistently strengthens privacy protection relative to LoRA-DP while maintaining comparable or better downstream utility. Moreover, TTLoRA exhibits lower membership leakage even without DP training, using substantially smaller adapters and requiring on average 7.6X fewer parameters than LoRA. Overall, our results demonstrate that TTLoRA offers a practical path to improving the privacy-utility tradeoff in parameter-efficient language model adaptation.

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Konstantina Mellou, Marco Molinaro, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-15T01:54:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose a novel batching and scheduling algorithm that minimizes inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   More specifically, we make the following contributions. First, to evaluate the performance of online algorithms for scheduling in LLM inference, we introduce a hindsight optimal benchmark, formulated as an integer program that computes the minimum total inference latency under full future information. Second, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio when the arrival process is arbitrary. Third, motivated by the computational intractability of solving the integer program at scale, we propose a polynomial-time online scheduling algorithm and show that under certain conditions it can achieve a constant competitive ratio. We also demonstrate our algorithm's strong empirical performance by comparing it to the hindsight optimal in a synthetic dataset. Finally, we conduct empirical evaluations on a real-world public LLM inference dataset, simulating the Llama2-70B model on A100 GPUs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

 ### Reuse your FLOPs: Scaling RL on Hard Problems by Conditioning on Very Off-Policy Prefixes
**Authors**: Amrith Setlur, Zijian Wang, Andrew Cohen, Paria Rashidinejad, Sang Michael Xie

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:57:00Z

**Summary**: Typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for LLM reasoning waste compute on hard problems, where correct on-policy traces are rare, policy gradients vanish, and learning stalls. To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.

### Unsupervised Text Segmentation via Kernel Change-Point Detection on Sentence Embeddings
**Authors**: Mumin Jia, Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:54:34Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised text segmentation is crucial because boundary labels are expensive, subjective, and often fail to transfer across domains and granularity choices. We propose Embed-KCPD, a training-free method that represents sentences as embedding vectors and estimates boundaries by minimizing a penalized KCPD objective. Beyond the algorithmic instantiation, we develop, to our knowledge, the first dependence-aware theory for KCPD under $m$-dependent sequences, a finite-memory abstraction of short-range dependence common in language. We prove an oracle inequality for the population penalized risk and a localization guarantee showing that each true change point is recovered within a window that is small relative to segment length. To connect theory to practice, we introduce an LLM-based simulation framework that generates synthetic documents with controlled finite-memory dependence and known boundaries, validating the predicted scaling behavior. Across standard segmentation benchmarks, Embed-KCPD often outperforms strong unsupervised baselines. A case study on Taylor Swift's tweets illustrates that Embed-KCPD combines strong theoretical guarantees, simulated reliability, and practical effectiveness for text segmentation.

### A Novel Lensed Point Source Modeling Pipeline using GIGA-Lens with Application to SN Zwicky and SN iPTF16geu
**Authors**: Saul Baltasar, Nicolas Ratier-Werbin, Xiaosheng Huang, W. Sheu, C. J. Storfer, Y. -M. Hsu, Sean Xu, David J. Schlegel

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:52:04Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel modeling pipeline for strongly lensed point sources, using the GIGA-Lens framework, running on four A100 GPUs via the JAX platform. Using simulations, we demonstrate accurate and precise recovery of image positions, fluxes, and time delays, together with inference of complex lens mass distributions -- including the mass density slope, $γ$ -- from images of lensed point sources alone. We further show that we can achieve statistical uncertainty of $\sim 3.6\%$ ($\sim 2.5\, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}/Mpc}$) on $H_0$ from a single system, with full forward modeling, i.e., simultaneous inference of all lens model parameters together with $H_0$. We apply our pipeline to two well-studied lensed SNe Ia, Zwicky and iPTF16geu. For SN iPTF16geu, unlike previous modeling efforts, we model only the images of the lensed point source (the SN) and do not use the lensed images of the extended host-galaxy. Nevertheless, we are able to infer all of the mass parameters modeled in earlier studies, and our best-fit values, including $γ$, are fully consistent with published results. In the case of SN Zwicky, taking the same approach, however, we obtain an alternative best-fit model compared to published results, underscoring the importance of fully exploring the model parameter space.

### POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration
**Authors**: Yuxiao Qu, Amrith Setlur, Virginia Smith, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:47:21Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.

### Teaching Models to Teach Themselves: Reasoning at the Edge of Learnability
**Authors**: Shobhita Sundaram, John Quan, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Kartik Ahuja, Yann Ollivier, Julia Kempe

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:46:56Z

**Summary**: Can a model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data.

### PRECISE: Reducing the Bias of LLM Evaluations Using Prediction-Powered Ranking Estimation
**Authors**: Abhishek Divekar, Anirban Majumder

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:46:49Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the quality of search, ranking and RAG systems traditionally requires a significant number of human relevance annotations. In recent times, several deployed systems have explored the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for this task while their inherent biases prevent direct use for metric estimation. We present a statistical framework extending Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that combines minimal human annotations with LLM judgments to produce reliable estimates of metrics which require sub-instance annotations. Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions). Detailed experiments across prominent retrieval datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the variance of estimates for the business-critical Precision@K metric, while effectively correcting for LLM bias in low-resource settings.

### Dep-Search: Learning Dependency-Aware Reasoning Traces with Persistent Memory
**Authors**: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Zixuan Yan, Yanxin Shen, Wenjie Xu, Yuefeng Huang, Xinyi Wang, Jiannan Cao, Jianwei Yin, Xuhong Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:42:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when augmented with search mechanisms that enable systematic exploration of external knowledge bases. The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.

### HiCache: A Plug-in Scaled-Hermite Upgrade for Taylor-Style Cache-then-Forecast Diffusion Acceleration
**Authors**: Liang Feng, Shikang Zheng, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Qinming Zhou, Peiliang Cai, Xinyu Wang, Junjie Chen, Chang Zou, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:39:41Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but often incur prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

### The Role of Intrinsic Temperature and Vertical Mixing in Characterizing Sub-Neptune Atmospheres
**Authors**: Neha Dushyantha Kumar, Jessica E. Libby-Roberts, Caleb I. Canas, Nicholas F. Wogan, Suvrath Mahadevan, Sagnick Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:38:20Z

**Summary**: Sub-Neptune planets are often modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich interior beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also be explained by a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. Atmospheric composition provides a key mechanism to break this degeneracy between competing interior models. However, the overall composition of sub-Neptunes inferred from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored parameter spaces such as stellar spectra, atmospheric metallicities, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet poorly constrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint (60 - 450 K) and Kzz (10^{5} - 10^{12} cm^2/s) using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN packages to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that Tint and Kzz significantly impact CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 and HCN abundances, with H2O being largely unaffected. Our work demonstrates that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra, and that single-parameter assumptions can lead to misclassification of planetary interiors. We provide a diagnostic framework using multi-molecule observations to distinguish between competing atmospheric models and advance robust characterization of sub-Neptunes.

### Consistent Kernel Change-Point Detection under m-Dependence for Text Segmentation
**Authors**: Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez, Mumin Jia

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:36:37Z

**Summary**: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.

### Beyond Preferences: Learning Alignment Principles Grounded in Human Reasons and Values
**Authors**: Henry Bell, Lara Neubauer da Costa Schertel, Bochu Ding, Brandon Fain

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:27:00Z

**Summary**: A crucial consideration when developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) is the human values to which these models are aligned. In the constitutional framework of alignment models are aligned to a set of principles (the constitution) specified in natural language. However, it is unclear how to fairly determine this constitution with widespread stakeholder input. In this work we propose Grounded Constitutional AI (GCAI), a unified framework for generating constitutions of principles that are representative of both users' general expectations toward AI (general principles) and their interaction-time preferences (contextual principles). We extend the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach to generate contextual principles from human preference annotation data by leveraging human-provided \textit{reasons} for their preferences. We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \textit{values} regarding AI. We show that a constitution generated by GCAI is preferred by humans over one generated through ICAI both personally, and for widespread use in governing AI behavior. Additionally participants consider the GCAI constitution to be more morally grounded, coherent, and pluralistic.

### $α^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks
**Authors**: Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Abderrahmane Lakas, Merouane Debbah

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:25:07Z

**Summary**: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.   We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).   We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench

### VoxGuard: Evaluating User and Attribute Privacy in Speech via Membership Inference Attacks
**Authors**: Efthymios Tsaprazlis, Thanathai Lertpetchpun, Tiantian Feng, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Shrikanth Narayanan

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:23:42Z

**Summary**: Voice anonymization aims to conceal speaker identity and attributes while preserving intelligibility, but current evaluations rely almost exclusively on Equal Error Rate (EER) that obscures whether adversaries can mount high-precision attacks. We argue that privacy should instead be evaluated in the low false-positive rate (FPR) regime, where even a small number of successful identifications constitutes a meaningful breach. To this end, we introduce VoxGuard, a framework grounded in differential privacy and membership inference that formalizes two complementary notions: User Privacy, preventing speaker re-identification, and Attribute Privacy, protecting sensitive traits such as gender and accent. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that informed adversaries, especially those using fine-tuned models and max-similarity scoring, achieve orders-of-magnitude stronger attacks at low-FPR despite similar EER. For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks recover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization. Our results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage, highlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a benchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.

### HalluGuard: Demystifying Data-Driven and Reasoning-Driven Hallucinations in LLMs
**Authors**: Xinyue Zeng, Junhong Lin, Yujun Yan, Feng Guo, Liang Shi, Jun Wu, Dawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:23:09Z

**Summary**: The reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific discovery is often compromised by hallucinations. These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations.

### CaTs and DAGs: Integrating Directed Acyclic Graphs with Transformers for Causally Constrained Predictions
**Authors**: Matthew J. Vowels, Mathieu Rochat, Sina Akbari

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:20:32Z

**Summary**: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including fully-connected networks and transformers, are highly flexible and powerful function approximators, widely applied in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, their inability to inherently respect causal structures can limit their robustness, making them vulnerable to covariate shift and difficult to interpret/explain. This poses significant challenges for their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Causal Transformers (CaTs), a general model class designed to operate under predefined causal constraints, as specified by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). CaTs retain the powerful function approximation abilities of traditional neural networks while adhering to the underlying structural constraints, improving robustness, reliability, and interpretability at inference time. This approach opens new avenues for deploying neural networks in more demanding, real-world scenarios where robustness and explainability is critical.

### Next Token Knowledge Tracing: Exploiting Pretrained LLM Representations to Decode Student Behaviour
**Authors**: Max Norris, Kobi Gal, Sahan Bulathwela

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:20:30Z

**Summary**: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

### TSRBench: A Comprehensive Multi-task Multi-modal Time Series Reasoning Benchmark for Generalist Models
**Authors**: Fangxu Yu, Xingang Guo, Lingzhi Yuan, Haoqiang Kang, Hongyu Zhao, Lianhui Qin, Furong Huang, Bin Hu, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:04:54Z

**Summary**: Time series data is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and crucial for critical applications ranging from energy management to traffic control. Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBench provides a standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models. Our code and dataset are available at https://tsrbench.github.io/.

### Self-Distilled Reasoner: On-Policy Self-Distillation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siyan Zhao, Zhihui Xie, Mengchen Liu, Jing Huang, Guan Pang, Feiyu Chen, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:56:50Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation improves large language model (LLM) reasoning by compressing the knowledge of a teacher LLM to train smaller LLMs. On-policy distillation advances this approach by having the student sample its own trajectories while a teacher LLM provides dense token-level supervision, addressing the distribution mismatch between training and inference in off-policy distillation methods. However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving 4-8x token efficiency compared to reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and superior performance over off-policy distillation methods.

### One Adapts to Any: Meta Reward Modeling for Personalized LLM Alignment
**Authors**: Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Tiezheng Yu, Fengbin Zhu, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Wenjie Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:55:52Z

**Summary**: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.

### Reflect: Transparent Principle-Guided Reasoning for Constitutional Alignment at Scale
**Authors**: Henry Bell, Caroline Zhang, Mohammed Mobasserul Haque, Dhaval Potdar, Samia Zaman, Brandon Fain

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:54:54Z

**Summary**: The constitutional framework of alignment aims to align large language models (LLMs) with value-laden principles written in natural language (such as to avoid using biased language). Prior work has focused on parameter fine-tuning techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to instill these principles. However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require careful engineering and tuning, and often require difficult-to-obtain human annotation data. We propose \textsc{reflect}, an inference-time framework for constitutional alignment that does not require any training or data, providing a plug-and-play approach for aligning an instruction-tuned model to a set of principles. \textsc{reflect} operates entirely in-context, combining a (i) constitution-conditioned base response with post-generation (ii) self-evaluation, (iii)(a) self-critique, and (iii)(b) final revision. \textsc{reflect}'s technique of explicit in-context reasoning over principles during post-generation outperforms standard few-shot prompting and provides transparent reasoning traces. Our results demonstrate that \textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations. Finally, we show that \textsc{reflect} naturally generates useful training data for traditional parameter fine-tuning techniques, allowing for efficient scaling and the reduction of inference-time computational overhead in long-term deployment scenarios.

### Riemannian AmbientFlow: Towards Simultaneous Manifold Learning and Generative Modeling from Corrupted Data
**Authors**: Willem Diepeveen, Oscar Leong

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:51:52Z

**Summary**: Modern generative modeling methods have demonstrated strong performance in learning complex data distributions from clean samples. In many scientific and imaging applications, however, clean samples are unavailable, and only noisy or linearly corrupted measurements can be observed. Moreover, latent structures, such as manifold geometries, present in the data are important to extract for further downstream scientific analysis. In this work, we introduce Riemannian AmbientFlow, a framework for simultaneously learning a probabilistic generative model and the underlying, nonlinear data manifold directly from corrupted observations. Building on the variational inference framework of AmbientFlow, our approach incorporates data-driven Riemannian geometry induced by normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of manifold structure through pullback metrics and Riemannian Autoencoders. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate geometric regularization and measurement conditions, the learned model recovers the underlying data distribution up to a controllable error and yields a smooth, bi-Lipschitz manifold parametrization. We further show that the resulting smooth decoder can serve as a principled generative prior for inverse problems with recovery guarantees. We empirically validate our approach on low-dimensional synthetic manifolds and on MNIST.

### A Computationally Efficient Maximum A Posteriori Sequence Estimation via Stein Variational Inference
**Authors**: Min-Won Seo, Solmaz S. Kia

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:43:08Z

**Summary**: State estimation in robotic systems presents significant challenges, particularly due to the prevalence of multimodal posterior distributions in real-world scenarios. One effective strategy for handling such complexity is to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequences over a discretized or sampled state space, which enables a concise representation of the most likely state trajectory. However, this approach often incurs substantial computational costs, especially in high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a novel MAP sequence estimation method, Stein-MAP-Seq, which effectively addresses multimodality while substantially reducing computational and memory overhead. Our key contribution is a sequential variational inference framework that captures temporal dependencies in dynamical system models and integrates Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) into a Viterbi-style dynamic programming algorithm, enabling computationally efficient MAP sequence estimation. This integration allows the method to focus computational effort on MAP-consistent modes rather than exhaustively exploring the entire state space. Stein-MAP-Seq inherits the parallelism and mode-seeking behavior of SVGD, allowing particle updates to be efficiently executed on parallel hardware and significantly reducing the number of trajectory candidates required for MAP-sequence recursion compared to conventional methods that rely on hundreds to thousands of particles. We validate the proposed approach on a range of highly multimodal scenarios, including nonlinear dynamics with ambiguous observations, unknown data association with outliers, range-only localization under temporary unobservability, and high-dimensional robotic manipulators. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimation accuracy and robustness to multimodality over existing estimation methods.

### Maximum softly penalised likelihood in factor analysis
**Authors**: Philipp Sterzinger, Ioannis Kosmids, Irini Moustaki

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:36:42Z

**Summary**: Estimation in exploratory factor analysis often yields estimates on the boundary of the parameter space. Such occurrences, known as Heywood cases, are characterised by non-positive variance estimates and can cause issues in numerical optimisation procedures or convergence failures, which, in turn, can lead to misleading inferences, particularly regarding factor scores and model selection. We derive sufficient conditions on the model and a penalty to the log-likelihood function that i) guarantee the existence of maximum penalised likelihood estimates in the interior of the parameter space, and ii) ensure that the corresponding estimators possess the desirable asymptotic properties expected by the maximum likelihood estimator, namely consistency and asymptotic normality. Consistency and asymptotic normality are achieved when the penalisation is soft enough, in a way that adapts to the information accumulation about the model parameters. We formally show, for the first time, that the penalties of Akaike (1987) and Hirose et al. (2011) to the log-likelihood of the normal linear factor model satisfy the conditions for existence, and, hence, deal with Heywood cases. Their vanilla versions, though, can result in questionable finite-sample properties in estimation, inference, and model selection. The maximum softly-penalised likelihood framework we introduce enables the careful scaling of those penalties to ensure that the resulting estimation and inference procedures inherit the ML estimator's optimal properties. Through comprehensive simulation studies and the analysis of real data sets, we illustrate the desirable finite-sample properties of the maximum softly penalised likelihood estimators and associated procedures.

### Ordering-based Causal Discovery via Generalized Score Matching
**Authors**: Vy Vo, He Zhao, Trung Le, Edwin V. Bonilla, Dinh Phung

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:35:03Z

**Summary**: Learning DAG structures from purely observational data remains a long-standing challenge across scientific domains. An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.

### Health-SCORE: Towards Scalable Rubrics for Improving Health-LLMs
**Authors**: Zhichao Yang, Sepehr Janghorbani, Dongxu Zhang, Jun Han, Qian Qian, Andrew Ressler, Gregory D. Lyng, Sanjit Singh Batra, Robert E. Tillman

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:34:10Z

**Summary**: Rubrics are essential for evaluating open-ended LLM responses, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. However, creating high-quality and domain-specific rubrics typically requires significant human expertise time and development cost, making rubric-based evaluation and training difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.

### From Fuzzy to Exact: The Halo Architecture for Infinite-Depth Reasoning via Rational Arithmetic
**Authors**: Hansheng Ren

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:24:34Z

**Summary**: Current paradigms in Deep Learning prioritize computational throughput over numerical precision, relying on the assumption that intelligence emerges from statistical correlation at scale. In this paper, we challenge this orthodoxy. We propose the Exactness Hypothesis: that General Intelligence (AGI), specifically high-order causal inference, requires a computational substrate capable of Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic. We argue that the "hallucinations" and logical incoherence seen in current Large Language Models (LLMs) are artifacts of IEEE 754 floating-point approximation errors accumulating over deep compositional functions. To mitigate this, we introduce the Halo Architecture, a paradigm shift to Rational Arithmetic ($\mathbb{Q}$) supported by a novel Exact Inference Unit (EIU). Empirical validation on the Huginn-0125 prototype demonstrates that while 600B-parameter scale BF16 baselines collapse in chaotic systems, Halo maintains zero numerical divergence indefinitely. This work establishes exact arithmetic as a prerequisite for reducing logical uncertainty in System 2 AGI.

### TEA-Bench: A Systematic Benchmarking of Tool-enhanced Emotional Support Dialogue Agent
**Authors**: Xingyu Sui, Yanyan Zhao, Yulin Hu, Jiahe Guo, Weixiang Zhao, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:15:27Z

**Summary**: Emotional Support Conversation requires not only affective expression but also grounded instrumental support to provide trustworthy guidance. However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents.

### Mechanistic Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:15:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models exhibit remarkable performance across diverse tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms. However, continual fine-tuning on sequential tasks induces catastrophic forgetting, where newly acquired knowledge interferes with previously learned capabilities. Despite widespread observations of this phenomenon, the mechanistic understanding remains limited. Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility. These findings establish mechanistic foundations for developing targeted mitigation strategies in continual learning systems.

### Bridging Instead of Replacing Online Coding Communities with AI through Community-Enriched Chatbot Designs
**Authors**: Junling Wang, Lahari Goswami, Gustavo Kreia Umbelino, Kiara Garcia Chau, Mrinmaya Sachan, April Yi Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:14:05Z

**Summary**: LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT have become popular tools for assisting with coding tasks. However, they often produce isolated responses and lack mechanisms for social learning or contextual grounding. In contrast, online coding communities like Kaggle offer socially mediated learning environments that foster critical thinking, engagement, and a sense of belonging. Yet, growing reliance on LLMs risks diminishing participation in these communities and weakening their collaborative value. To address this, we propose Community-Enriched AI, a design paradigm that embeds social learning dynamics into LLM-based chatbots by surfacing user-generated content and social design feature from online coding communities. Using this paradigm, we implemented a RAG-based AI chatbot leveraging resources from Kaggle to validate our design. Across two empirical studies involving 28 and 12 data science learners, respectively, we found that Community-Enriched AI significantly enhances user trust, encourages engagement with community, and effectively supports learners in solving data science tasks. We conclude by discussing design implications for AI assistance systems that bridge -- rather than replace -- online coding communities.

### Exploration vs Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward
**Authors**: Peter Chen, Xiaopeng Li, Ziniu Li, Wotao Yin, Xi Chen, Tianyi Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:06:02Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

### Masked Generative Policy for Robotic Control
**Authors**: Lipeng Zhuang, Shiyu Fan, Florent P. Audonnet, Yingdong Ru, Edmond S. L. Ho, Gerardo Aragon Camarasa, Paul Henderson

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:04:17Z

**Summary**: We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.

### Learned harmonic mean estimation of the marginal likelihood for multimodal posteriors with flow matching
**Authors**: Alicja Polanska, Jason D. McEwen

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:00:08Z

**Summary**: The marginal likelihood, or Bayesian evidence, is a crucial quantity for Bayesian model comparison but its computation can be challenging for complex models, even in parameters space of moderate dimension. The learned harmonic mean estimator has been shown to provide accurate and robust estimates of the marginal likelihood simply using posterior samples. It is agnostic to the sampling strategy, meaning that the samples can be obtained using any method. This enables marginal likelihood calculation and model comparison with whatever sampling is most suitable for the task. However, the internal density estimators considered previously for the learned harmonic mean can struggle with highly multimodal posteriors. In this work we introduce flow matching-based continuous normalizing flows as a powerful architecture for the internal density estimation of the learned harmonic mean. We demonstrate the ability to handle challenging multimodal posteriors, including an example in 20 parameter dimensions, showcasing the method's ability to handle complex posteriors without the need for fine-tuning or heuristic modifications to the base distribution.

### CtrlRAG: Black-box Document Poisoning Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Runqi Sui

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:58:51Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response credibility and traceability by displaying reference contexts, but this transparency simultaneously introduces a novel black-box attack vector. Existing document poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious documents into the knowledge base to manipulate RAG outputs, rely primarily on unrealistic white-box or gray-box assumptions, limiting their practical applicability. To address this gap, we propose CtrlRAG, a two-stage black-box attack that (1) constructs malicious documents containing misinformation or emotion-inducing content and injects them into the knowledge base, and (2) iteratively optimizes them using a localization algorithm and Masked Language Model (MLM) guided on reference context feedback, ensuring their retrieval priority while preserving linguistic naturalness. With only five malicious documents per target question injected into the million-document MS MARCO dataset, CtrlRAG achieves up to 90% attack success rates on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), a 30% improvement over optimal baselines, in both *Emotion Manipulation* and *Hallucination Amplification* tasks. Furthermore, we show that existing defenses fail to balance security and performance. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a dynamic *Knowledge Expansion* defense strategy based on *Parametric/Non-parametric Memory Confrontation*, blocking 78% of attacks while maintaining 95.5% system accuracy. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems and provide effective defense strategies.

### MARC: Memory-Augmented RL Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding
**Authors**: Peiran Wu, Zhuorui Yu, Yunze Liu, Chi-Hao Wu, Enmin Zhou, Junxiao Shen

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:58:19Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

**Authors**: Yee Man Choi, Xuehang Guo, Yi R. Fung, Qingyun Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:50:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising assistants for scientific writing. However, there have been concerns regarding the quality and reliability of the generated text, one of which is the citation accuracy and faithfulness. While most recent work relies on methods such as LLM-as-a-Judge, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge alone is also in doubt. In this work, we reframe citation evaluation as a problem of citation attribution alignment, which assesses whether LLM-generated citations match those a human author would include for the same text. We propose CiteGuard, a retrieval-aware agent framework designed to provide more faithful grounding for citation validation. CiteGuard improves the prior baseline by 17%, and achieves up to 68.1% accuracy on the CiteME benchmark, approaching human-level performance (69.7%). It also enables the identification of alternative but valid citations and demonstrates generalization ability for cross-domain citation attribution.Our code is available at https://github.com/KathCYM/CiteGuard.

### Not Your Typical Sycophant: The Elusive Nature of Sycophancy in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shahar Ben Natan, Oren Tsur

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:45:31Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

**Authors**: Junchen Fu, Xuri Ge, Kaiwen Zheng, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Xin Xin, Yongxin Ni, Joemon M. Jose

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:44:12Z

**Summary**: In an era where micro-videos dominate platforms like TikTok and YouTube, AI-generated content is nearing cinematic quality. The next frontier is using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create viral micro-videos, a largely untapped potential that could shape the future of AI-driven content creation. To address this gap, this paper presents the first exploration of LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). We selected popcorn as the icon for this paper because it symbolizes leisure and entertainment, aligning with this study on leveraging LLMs as assistants for generating popular micro-videos that are often consumed during leisure time. Specifically, we empirically study the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? Exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 can generate micro-videos with popularity rivaling human content. Prompt enhancement further boosts results, while benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and R1 for LLMs, and LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo for video generation. This work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation and opens new research directions. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/LLMPopcorn.

### Gaussian Variational Inference with Non-Gaussian Factors for State Estimation: A UWB Localization Case Study
**Authors**: Andrew Stirling, Mykola Lukashchuk, Dmitry Bagaev, Wouter Kouw, James R. Forbes

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:40:41Z

**Summary**: This letter extends the exactly sparse Gaussian variational inference (ESGVI) algorithm for state estimation in two complementary directions. First, ESGVI is generalized to operate on matrix Lie groups, enabling the estimation of states with orientation components while respecting the underlying group structure. Second, factors are introduced to accommodate heavy-tailed and skewed noise distributions, as commonly encountered in ultra-wideband (UWB) localization due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. Both extensions are shown to integrate naturally within the ESGVI framework while preserving its sparse and derivative-free structure. The proposed approach is validated in a UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy and comparable consistency. Finally, a Python implementation within a factor-graph-based estimation framework is made open-source (https://github.com/decargroup/gvi_ws) to support broader research use.

### Beyond Data Privacy: New Privacy Risks for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuntao Du, Zitao Li, Ninghui Li, Bolin Ding

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:30:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.

### GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Aryan Yazdan Parast, Parsa Hosseini, Hesam Asadollahzadeh, Arshia Soltani Moakhar, Basim Azam, Soheil Feizi, Naveed Akhtar

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:30:01Z

**Summary**: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

### RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems
**Authors**: Chenyang Zhu, Spencer Hong, Jingyu Wu, Kushal Chawla, Charlotte Tang, Youbing Yin, Nathan Wolfe, Erin Babinsky, Daben Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:25:46Z

**Summary**: The advent of complex, interconnected long-horizon LLM systems has made it incredibly tricky to identify where and when these systems break down. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today are limited in that they often focus on simple metrics, end-to-end outcomes, and are dependent on the perspectives of humans. In order to match the increasing complexity of these many component systems, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the nuanced logic passing through these systems. In this paper, we present RAFFLES, an offline evaluation architecture that incorporates iterative reasoning. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically identify faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess the quality of the candidate faults as well as rationales of the Judge. We evaluated RAFFLES with several benchmarks - the Who&When dataset to identify step-level faults in multi-agent systems and the ReasonEval datasets to diagnose step-level mathematical reasoning errors. RAFFLES outperforms strong baselines, achieving an accuracy of over 20% and 50% on the Who&When Hand-Crafted and Algorithmically-Generated datasets, and over 80% on the ReasonEval datasets. These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual review.

### Data Valuation for LLM Fine-Tuning: Efficient Shapley Value Approximation via Language Model Arithmetic
**Authors**: Mélissa Tamine, Otmane Sakhi, Benjamin Heymann

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:21:48Z

**Summary**: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

### FadeMem: Biologically-Inspired Forgetting for Efficient Agent Memory
**Authors**: Lei Wei, Xu Dong, Xiao Peng, Niantao Xie, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:12:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models deployed as autonomous agents face critical memory limitations, lacking selective forgetting mechanisms that lead to either catastrophic forgetting at context boundaries or information overload within them. While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:12:02Z

**Summary**: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.

### AdaReasoner: Dynamic Tool Orchestration for Iterative Visual Reasoning
**Authors**: Mingyang Song, Haoyu Sun, Jiawei Gu, Linjie Li, Luxin Xu, Ranjay Krishna, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:04:43Z

**Summary**: When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.

### Assessing the Quality of Mental Health Support in LLM Responses through Multi-Attribute Human Evaluation
**Authors**: Abeer Badawi, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Elahe Rahimi, Sheri Grach, Lindsay Bertrand, Lames Danok, Frank Rudzicz, Jimmy Huang, Elham Dolatabadi

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:04:19Z

**Summary**: The escalating global mental health crisis, marked by persistent treatment gaps, availability, and a shortage of qualified therapists, positions Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising avenue for scalable support. While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.

### Constraining Reionization Morphology and Source Properties with 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlation Surveys
**Authors**: Yannic Pietschke, Anne Hutter, Caroline Heneka

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:02:28Z

**Summary**: Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies. We quantify the constraining power of 21cm-Galaxy cross-power spectra for inferring neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ and mean overdensity $\langle 1+δ_\mathrm{HI} \rangle(z)$, exploring dependence on field of view, redshift precision $σ_z$, and minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{h,min}$. We employ our simulation-based inference framework EoRFlow for likelihood-free parameter estimation. Mock observations include thermal noise for 100h SKA-Low with foreground avoidance and realistic galaxy survey effects. For a fiducial survey ($\mathrm{FOV}=100\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, $σ_z=0.001$, $M_\mathrm{h,min}=10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$), cross-power spectra yield unbiased constraints with posterior volumes (PV) of $\sim$10% relative to priors. Cross-power measurements reduce PV by 20-30% versus 21cm auto-power alone. With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $>$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{h,min} \sim 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $<$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints. Realizing full potential requires precise redshifts and either faint galaxy detection limits or improved 21cm foreground cleaning.

### CONQUER: Context-Aware Representation with Query Enhancement for Text-Based Person Search
**Authors**: Zequn Xie

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:01:33Z

**Summary**: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve pedestrian images from large galleries using natural language descriptions. This task, essential for public safety applications, is hindered by cross-modal discrepancies and ambiguous user queries. We introduce CONQUER, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges by enhancing cross-modal alignment during training and adaptively refining queries at inference. During training, CONQUER employs multi-granularity encoding, complementary pair mining, and context-guided optimal matching based on Optimal Transport to learn robust embeddings. At inference, a plug-and-play query enhancement module refines vague or incomplete queries via anchor selection and attribute-driven enrichment, without requiring retraining of the backbone. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that CONQUER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both Rank-1 accuracy and mAP, yielding notable improvements in cross-domain and incomplete-query scenarios. These results highlight CONQUER as a practical and effective solution for real-world TBPS deployment. Source code is available at https://github.com/zqxie77/CONQUER.

**Authors**: Panagiotis Lymperopoulos, Abhiramon Rajasekharan, Ian Berlot-Attwell, Stéphane Aroca-Ouellette, Kaheer Suleman

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:58:53Z

**Summary**: Building world models is essential for planning in real-world domains such as businesses. Since such domains have rich semantics, we can leverage world knowledge to effectively model complex action effects and causal relationships from limited data. In this work, we propose CASSANDRA, a neurosymbolic world modeling approach that leverages an LLM as a knowledge prior to construct lightweight transition models for planning. CASSANDRA integrates two components: (1) LLM-synthesized code to model deterministic features, and (2) LLM-guided structure learning of a probabilistic graphical model to capture causal relationships among stochastic variables. We evaluate CASSANDRA in (i) a small-scale coffee-shop simulator and (ii) a complex theme park business simulator, where we demonstrate significant improvements in transition prediction and planning over baselines.

### HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding
**Authors**: Haowei Zhang, Shudong Yang, Jinlan Fu, See-Kiong Ng, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

### Resisting Manipulative Bots in Meme Coin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Yichen Luo, Yebo Feng, Jiahua Xu, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:36Z

**Summary**: Copy trading has become the dominant entry strategy in meme coin markets. However, due to the market's extreme illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from naïve copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists. We propose a manipulation-resistant copy-trading system based on a multi-agent architecture powered by a multi-modal, explainable large language model (LLM). Our system decomposes copy trading into three specialized agents for coin evaluation, wallet selection, and timing assessment. Evaluated on historical data from over 6,000 meme coins, our approach outperforms zero-shot and most statistic-driven baselines in prediction accuracy as well as all baselines in economic performance, achieving an average return of 14% for identified smart-money trades and an estimated copier return of 3% per trade under realistic market frictions. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agent-based defenses and predictability of trader profitability in adversarial meme coin markets, providing a practical foundation for robust copy trading.

### Cross-Platform Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models from Edge to Cloud GPUs
**Authors**: Amir Taherin, Juyi Lin, Arash Akbari, Arman Akbari, Pu Zhao, Weiwei Chen, David Kaeli, Yanzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:20Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.

### SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lei Zhong, Yi Yang, Changjian Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:51:20Z

**Summary**: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.

### Towards a Physics Foundation Model
**Authors**: Florian Wiesner, Matthias Wessling, Stephen Baek

**Summary**: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative - democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by more than 7x, (2) plausible zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) more stable long-term predictions through long-horizon rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.

### EFSI-DETR: Efficient Frequency-Semantic Integration for Real-Time Small Object Detection in UAV Imagery
**Authors**: Yu Xia, Chang Liu, Tianqi Xiang, Zhigang Tu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:41:37Z

**Summary**: Real-time small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery remains challenging due to limited feature representation and ineffective multi-scale fusion. Existing methods underutilize frequency information and rely on static convolutional operations, which constrain the capacity to obtain rich feature representations and hinder the effective exploitation of deep semantic features. To address these issues, we propose EFSI-DETR, a novel detection framework that integrates efficient semantic feature enhancement with dynamic frequency-spatial guidance. EFSI-DETR comprises two main components: (1) a Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Unified Synergy Network (DyFusNet) that jointly exploits frequency and spatial cues for robust multi-scale feature fusion, (2) an Efficient Semantic Feature Concentrator (ESFC) that enables deep semantic extraction with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, a Fine-grained Feature Retention (FFR) strategy is adopted to incorporate spatially rich shallow features during fusion to preserve fine-grained details, crucial for small object detection in UAV imagery. Extensive experiments on VisDrone and CODrone benchmarks demonstrate that our EFSI-DETR achieves the state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency, yielding improvement of \textbf{1.6}\% and \textbf{5.8}\% in AP and AP$_{s}$ on VisDrone, while obtaining \textbf{188} FPS inference speed on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

### A Balanced Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Commonsense Abductive Logic
**Authors**: Joseph Cotnareanu, Didier Chetelat, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:40:26Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive formal reasoning abilities, they often break down when problems require complex proof planning. One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts.

### Computational Phenomenology of Borderline Personality Disorder: A Comparative Evaluation of LLM-Simulated Expert Personas and Human Clinical Experts
**Authors**: Marcin Moskalewicz, Anna Sterna, Karolina Drożdż, Kacper Dudzic, Marek Pokropski, Paula Flores

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:37:22Z

**Summary**: Building on a human-led thematic analysis of life-story interviews with inpatients with Borderline Personality Disorder, this study examines the capacity of large language models (OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude) to support qualitative clinical analysis. The models were evaluated through a mixed procedure. Study A involved blinded and non-blinded expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients for overlap of outputs, multidimensional validity ratings of credibility, coherence, and the substantiveness of results, and their grounding in qualitative data. In Study B, neural methods were used to embed the theme descriptions created by humans and the models in a two-dimensional vector space to provide a computational measure of the difference between human and model semantics and linguistic style. In Study C, complementary non-expert evaluations were conducted to examine the influence of thematic verbosity on the perception of human authorship and content validity. Results of all three studies revealed variable overlap with the human analysis, with models being partly indistinguishable from, and also identifying themes originally omitted by, human researchers. The findings highlight both the variability and potential of AI-augmented thematic qualitative analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias and enhance sensitivity.

### Stability as a Liability:Systematic Breakdown of Linguistic Structure in LLMs
**Authors**: Xianzhe Meng, Qiangsheng Zeng, Ling Luo, Qinghan Yang, Jiarui Hao, Wenbo Wu, Qinyu Wang, Rui Yin, Lin Qi, Renzhi Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:34:50Z

**Summary**: Training stability is typically regarded as a prerequisite for reliable optimization in large language models. In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality.

### From Classification to Ranking: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities for MBTI Personality Detection
**Authors**: Yuan Cao, Feixiang Liu, Xinyue Wang, Yihan Zhu, Hui Xu, Zheng Wang, Qiang Qiu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:28:43Z

**Summary**: Personality detection aims to measure an individual's corresponding personality traits through their social media posts. The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function. Unlike verification tasks with definitive solutions, personality assessment involves subjective interpretations and blurred boundaries between trait categories. Our reward function explicitly addresses this challenge by training LLMs to learn optimal answer rankings. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple personality detection benchmarks.

### FastInsight: Fast and Insightful Retrieval via Fusion Operators for Graph RAG
**Authors**: Seonho An, Chaejeong Hyun, Min-Soo Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:23:41Z

**Summary**: Existing Graph RAG methods aiming for insightful retrieval on corpus graphs typically rely on time-intensive processes that interleave Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.

### Self-Refining Video Sampling
**Authors**: Sangwon Jang, Taekyung Ki, Jaehyeong Jo, Saining Xie, Jaehong Yoon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:22:27Z

**Summary**: Modern video generators still struggle with complex physical dynamics, often falling short of physical realism. Existing approaches address this using external verifiers or additional training on augmented data, which is computationally expensive and still limited in capturing fine-grained motion. In this work, we present self-refining video sampling, a simple method that uses a pre-trained video generator trained on large-scale datasets as its own self-refiner. By interpreting the generator as a denoising autoencoder, we enable iterative inner-loop refinement at inference time without any external verifier or additional training. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement strategy that selectively refines regions based on self-consistency, which prevents artifacts caused by over-refinement. Experiments on state-of-the-art video generators demonstrate significant improvements in motion coherence and physics alignment, achieving over 70\% human preference compared to the default sampler and guidance-based sampler.

### One Persona, Many Cues, Different Results: How Sociodemographic Cues Impact LLM Personalization
**Authors**: Franziska Weeber, Vera Neplenbroek, Jan Batzner, Sebastian Padó

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:15:58Z

**Summary**: Personalization of LLMs by sociodemographic subgroup often improves user experience, but can also introduce or amplify biases and unfair outcomes across groups. Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues.

### Attention-Based Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter for Legged Robot State Estimation
**Authors**: Seokju Lee, Kyung-Soo Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:13:36Z

**Summary**: In this letter, we propose an Attention-Based Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (AttenNKF) for state estimation in legged robots. Foot slip is a major source of estimation error: when slip occurs, kinematic measurements violate the no-slip assumption and inject bias during the update step. Our objective is to estimate this slip-induced error and compensate for it. To this end, we augment an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) with a neural compensator that uses an attention mechanism to infer error conditioned on foot-slip severity and then applies this estimate as a post-update compensation to the InEKF state (i.e., after the filter update). The compensator is trained in a latent space, which aims to reduce sensitivity to raw input scales and encourages structured slip-conditioned compensations, while preserving the InEKF recursion. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing legged-robot state estimators, particularly under slip-prone conditions.

### An LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Age of Information Optimization in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks
**Authors**: Fang Liu, Erchao Zhu, Jiedan Tan, Jingwen Tong, Taotao Wang, Shengli Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:10:09Z

**Summary**: With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous wireless networks, the Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of real-time and personalized systems. While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an "Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.

### SIPDO: Closed-Loop Prompt Optimization via Synthetic Data Feedback
**Authors**: Yaoning Yu, Ye Yu, Peiyan Zhang, Kai Wei, Haojing Luo, Haohan Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:07:30Z

**Summary**: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.

### Induce, Align, Predict: Zero-Shot Stance Detection via Cognitive Inductive Reasoning
**Authors**: Bowen Zhang, Jun Ma, Fuqiang Niu, Li Dong, Jinzhou Cao, Genan Dai

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:05:54Z

**Summary**: Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) seeks to determine the stance of text toward previously unseen targets, a task critical for analyzing dynamic and polarized online discourse with limited labeled data. While large language models (LLMs) offer zero-shot capabilities, prompting-based approaches often fall short in handling complex reasoning and lack robust generalization to novel targets. Meanwhile, LLM-enhanced methods still require substantial labeled data and struggle to move beyond instance-level patterns, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. Inspired by cognitive science, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF), a schema-driven method that bridges linguistic inputs and abstract reasoning via automatic induction and application of cognitive reasoning schemas. CIRF abstracts first-order logic patterns from raw text into multi-relational schema graphs in an unsupervised manner, and leverages a schema-enhanced graph kernel model to align input structures with schema templates for robust, interpretable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks demonstrate that CIRF not only establishes new state-of-the-art results, but also achieves comparable performance with just 30% of the labeled data, demonstrating its strong generalization and efficiency in low-resource settings.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:03:36Z

**Summary**: We present a family of open-source Music Foundation Models designed to advance large-scale music understanding and generation across diverse tasks and modalities. Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio-text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.

### Cosmographic constraints from late-time probes including fast radio bursts
**Authors**: Lázaro L. Sales, Klecio E. L. de Farias, Amilcar R. Queiroz, João R. L. Santos, Rafael A. Batista, Ana R. M. Oliveira, Lucas F. Santana, Carlos A. Wuensche, Thyrso Villela, Jordany Vieira

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:02:31Z

**Summary**: In this study, we use late-time probes, such as well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SNe), and cosmic chronometers (CC) to constrain cosmological parameters through a model-independent cosmographic approach. By integrating FRB data with BAO from DESI DR2, SNe, and CC, we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the jerk parameter ($j_0$), using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for parameter estimation. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 66.35^{+4.13}_{-5.04} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.33^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, and $j_0 = 0.83^{+0.57}_{-0.67}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 6\%$ for the Hubble constant and showing consistency with the $Λ$CDM expectation. The DESI+CMB dataset yields $H_0 = 65.59^{+1.25}_{-1.24} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$, and $j_0 = 0.58^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, providing a $\sim 2\%$ precision on $H_0$ and may suggest a possible tension in the late-time kinematic sector relative to the $Λ$CDM expectation when BAO measurements are calibrated with a Planck-inferred sound horizon. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI+CMB, and CC datasets further tightens the constraints to $H_0 = 68.03^{+0.53}_{-0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.41 \pm 0.02$, and $j_0 = 0.55 \pm 0.02$, with the jerk parameter remaining lower than $j_0 = 1$ at the $1σ$ confidence level. These findings hint at a possible late-time kinematic tension, as indicated by the inferred value of the jerk parameter, which is primarily driven by the DESI+CMB dataset under standard early-Universe assumptions for the sound horizon.

### Deconstructing Instruction-Following: A New Benchmark for Granular Evaluation of Large Language Model Instruction Compliance Abilities
**Authors**: Alberto Purpura, Li Wang, Sahil Badyal, Eugenio Beaufrand, Adam Faulkner

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:02:15Z

**Summary**: Reliably ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) follow complex instructions is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world use or isolate compliance from task success. We introduce MOSAIC (MOdular Synthetic Assessment of Instruction Compliance), a modular framework that uses a dynamically generated dataset with up to 20 application-oriented generation constraints to enable a granular and independent analysis of this capability. Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position. The analysis reveals model-specific weaknesses, uncovers synergistic and conflicting interactions between instructions, and identifies distinct positional biases such as primacy and recency effects. These granular insights are critical for diagnosing model failures and developing more reliable LLMs for systems that demand strict adherence to complex instructions.

### Uncertainty quantification in model discovery by distilling interpretable material constitutive models from Gaussian process posteriors
**Authors**: David Anton, Henning Wessels, Ulrich Römer, Alexander Henkes, Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:59:21Z

**Summary**: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which, in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for the material parameters, are restricted to linear coefficients of the model library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability distribution. We therefore propose a partially Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of constitutive models with inner-non-linear parameters: First, we augment the available stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for modeling complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol' sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate the capability of our framework for both isotropic and experimental anisotropic data.

### Unknown Unknowns: Why Hidden Intentions in LLMs Evade Detection
**Authors**: Devansh Srivastav, David Pape, Lea Schönherr

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:59:17Z

**Summary**: LLMs are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, yet their outputs can encode subtle, unintended behaviours that shape user beliefs and actions. We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of detectability failures of hidden intentions in LLMs under open-world settings, offering a foundation for understanding, inducing, and stress-testing such behaviours, and establishing a flexible taxonomy for anticipating evolving threats and informing governance.

### Harnessing the Universal Geometry of Embeddings
**Authors**: Rishi Jha, Collin Zhang, Vitaly Shmatikov, John X. Morris

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:47:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce the first method for translating text embeddings from one vector space to another without any paired data, encoders, or predefined sets of matches. Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures, parameter counts, and training datasets.   The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for classification and attribute inference.

### From Verifiable Dot to Reward Chain: Harnessing Verifiable Reference-based Rewards for Reinforcement Learning of Open-ended Generation
**Authors**: Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Qiyuan Zhang, Xingshan Zeng, Liangyou Li, Jierun Chen, Chaofan Tao, Haoli Bai, Lifeng Shang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:39:58Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) succeeds in reasoning tasks (e.g., math and code) by checking the final verifiable answer (i.e., a verifiable dot signal). However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment. We release our code and data at https://github.com/YJiangcm/RLVRR.

### Thinking on the Fly: Test-Time Reasoning Enhancement via Latent Thought Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Wengao Ye, Yan Liang, Lianlei Shan

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:30:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning, where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text. However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.

### The PIMMUR Principles: Ensuring Validity in Collective Behavior of LLM Societies
**Authors**: Jiaxu Zhou, Jen-tse Huang, Xuhui Zhou, Man Ho Lam, Xintao Wang, Hao Zhu, Wenxuan Wang, Maarten Sap

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:24:09Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to simulate human collective behaviors, yet the methodological rigor of these "AI societies" remains under-explored. Through a systematic audit of 42 recent studies, we identify six pervasive flaws-spanning agent profiles, interaction, memory, control, unawareness, and realism (PIMMUR). Our analysis reveals that 90.7% of studies violate at least one principle, undermining simulation validity. We demonstrate that frontier LLMs correctly identify the underlying social experiment in 47.6% of cases, while 65.3% of prompts exert excessive control that pre-determines outcomes. By reproducing five representative experiments (e.g., telephone game), we show that reported collective phenomena often vanish or reverse when PIMMUR principles are enforced, suggesting that many "emergent" behaviors are methodological artifacts rather than genuine social dynamics. Our findings suggest that current AI simulations may capture model-specific biases rather than universal human social behaviors, raising critical concerns about the use of LLMs as scientific proxies for human society.

### Scaling up Privacy-Preserving ML: A CKKS Implementation of Llama-2-7B
**Authors**: Jaiyoung Park, Sejin Park, Jai Hyun Park, Jung Ho Ahn, Jung Hee Cheon, Guillaume Hanrot, Jung Woo Kim, Minje Park, Damien Stehlé

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:17:23Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, privacy concerns pertaining to inference inputs keep growing. In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs.   We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference.   Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers.   Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted. On a cluster of 8~NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs, inference takes 85s for summarization and 33s for generation per output token.

### Using Large Language Models to Construct Virtual Top Managers: A Method for Organizational Research
**Authors**: Antonio Garzon-Vico, Krithika Sharon Komalapati, Arsalan Shahid, Jan Rosier

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:17:23Z

**Summary**: This study introduces a methodological framework that uses large language models to create virtual personas of real top managers. Drawing on real CEO communications and Moral Foundations Theory, we construct LLM-based participants that simulate the decision-making of individual leaders. Across three phases, we assess construct validity, reliability, and behavioral fidelity by benchmarking these virtual CEOs against human participants. Our results indicate that theoretically scaffolded personas approximate the moral judgements observed in human samples, suggesting that LLM-based personas can serve as credible and complementary tools for organizational research in contexts where direct access to executives is limited. We conclude by outlining implications for future research using LLM-based personas in organizational settings.

### Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning: Continual Learning in LLM Agents Without Gradient Updates
**Authors**: Yibo Li, Zijie Lin, Ailin Deng, Xuan Zhang, Yufei He, Shuo Ji, Tri Cao, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:16:51Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at general tasks, they inherently struggle with continual adaptation due to the frozen weights after deployment. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution but incurs prohibitive computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning (JitRL), a training-free framework that enables test-time policy optimization without any gradient updates. JitRL maintains a dynamic, non-parametric memory of experiences and retrieves relevant trajectories to estimate action advantages on-the-fly. These estimates are then used to directly modulate the LLM's output logits. We theoretically prove that this additive update rule is the exact closed-form solution to the KL-constrained policy optimization objective. Extensive experiments on WebArena and Jericho demonstrate that JitRL establishes a new state-of-the-art among training-free methods. Crucially, JitRL outperforms the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods (e.g., WebRL) while reducing monetary costs by over 30 times, offering a scalable path for continual learning agents. The code is available at https://github.com/liushiliushi/JitRL.

### On the Failure of Latent State Persistence in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jen-tse Huang, Kaiser Sun, Wenxuan Wang, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:13:17Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, whether they can sustain persistent latent states remains under-explored. The capacity to maintain and manipulate unexpressed, internal representations-analogous to human working memory-is a cornerstone of complex reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the "Latent State Persistence" (LSP) gap through three novel experiments. First, we utilize a Number Guessing Game, demonstrating that across independent queries, LLMs fail to allocate probability mass to a singular hidden choice, violating a fundamental probabilistic principle. Second, we employ a Yes-No Game to show that as the number of questions increases, LLMs suffer from "concept drift," leading to inevitable self-contradictions due to the lack of LSP. Finally, inspired by Mathematical Mentalism, we task models with tracking transformations on hidden variables, revealing a failure in variable binding and state evolution when the initial state is not explicitly present in the context. Collectively, these findings suggest that LLMs function as reactive post-hoc solvers rather than proactive planners with LSP. Our work provides a framework for evaluating the fidelity of internal representations and highlights a fundamental architectural divergence between autoregressive transformers and human-like cognition.

### Improving the Accuracy of Amortized Model Comparison with Self-Consistency
**Authors**: Šimon Kucharský, Aayush Mishra, Daniel Habermann, Stefan T. Radev, Paul-Christian Bürkner

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:12:31Z

**Summary**: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) offers fast, scalable approximations to posterior densities by training neural surrogates on data simulated from the statistical model. However, ABI methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification: when observed data fall outside the training distribution (generative scope of the statistical models), neural surrogates can behave unpredictably. This makes it a challenge in a model comparison setting, where multiple statistical models are considered, of which at least some are misspecified. Recent work on self-consistency (SC) provides a promising remedy to this issue, accessible even for empirical data (without ground-truth labels). In this work, we investigate how SC can improve amortized model comparison conceptualized in four different ways. Across two synthetic and two real-world case studies, we find that approaches for model comparison that estimate marginal likelihoods through approximate parameter posteriors consistently outperform methods that directly approximate model evidence or posterior model probabilities. SC training improves robustness when the likelihood is available, even under severe model misspecification. The benefits of SC for methods without access of analytic likelihoods are more limited and inconsistent. Our results suggest practical guidance for reliable amortized Bayesian model comparison: prefer parameter posterior-based methods and augment them with SC training on empirical datasets to mitigate extrapolation bias under model misspecification.

### Nearly Optimal Bayesian Inference for Structural Missingness
**Authors**: Chen Liang, Donghua Yang, Yutong Wang, Tianle Zhang, Shenghe Zhou, Zhiyu Liang, Hengtong Zhang, Hongzhi Wang, Ziqi Li, Xiyang Zhang, Zheng Liang, Yifei Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:03:11Z

**Summary**: Structural missingness breaks 'just impute and train': values can be undefined by causal or logical constraints, and the mask may depend on observed variables, unobserved variables (MNAR), and other missingness indicators. It simultaneously brings (i) a catch-22 situation with causal loop, prediction needs the missing features, yet inferring them depends on the missingness mechanism, (ii) under MNAR, the unseen are different, the missing part can come from a shifted distribution, and (iii) plug-in imputation, a single fill-in can lock in uncertainty and yield overconfident, biased decisions. In the Bayesian view, prediction via the posterior predictive distribution integrates over the full model posterior uncertainty, rather than relying on a single point estimate. This framework decouples (i) learning an in-model missing-value posterior from (ii) label prediction by optimizing the predictive posterior distribution, enabling posterior integration. This decoupling yields an in-model almost-free-lunch: once the posterior is learned, prediction is plug-and-play while preserving uncertainty propagation. It achieves SOTA on 43 classification and 15 imputation benchmarks, with finite-sample near Bayes-optimality guarantees under our SCM prior.

### Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet
**Authors**: Mohammad Ali Vahedifar, Qi Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:02:44Z

**Summary**: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%, while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy, SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.

### Regulatory Hub Discovery in MDD Methylome: Hypotheses for Molecular Subtypes via Computational Analysis
**Authors**: Mingyan Liu, Min Huang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:02:14Z

**Summary**: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome with diverse etiological pathways. Traditional Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) have successfully identified risk loci based on differential methylation magnitude. As a complementary perspective, effect-size-based ranking alone may not fully capture regulatory nodes that exhibit modest methylation changes but occupy critical upstream positions in biological networks. Here, we report findings and hypotheses from a two-tier computational analysis of DNA methylation data (GSE198904; \(n=206\) ), combining conventional statistical approaches with machine learning-assisted regulatory inference.

### Discrete Mode Decomposition Meets Shapley Value: Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet
**Authors**: Mohammad Ali Vahedifar, Qi Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:59:33Z

**Summary**: Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and high reliability to ensure stability and transparency in touch-enabled teleoperation. However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions.   Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems.

### DEEPMED: Building a Medical DeepResearch Agent via Multi-hop Med-Search Data and Turn-Controlled Agentic Training & Inference
**Authors**: Zihan wang, Hao Wang, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Yiqun Zhang, Jinghao Lin, Haihua Yang, Xiaozhong Ji

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:57:48Z

**Summary**: Medical reasoning models remain constrained by parametric knowledge and are thus susceptible to forgetting and hallucinations. DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus "find it but fail to use it," leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.

### On the synchronization between Hugging Face pre-trained language models and their upstream GitHub repository
**Authors**: Adekunle Ajibode, Abdul Ali Bangash, Oussama Ben Sghaier, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:48:19Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained language models (PTLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling major advances in tasks such as text generation and translation. Similar to software package management, PTLMs are developed using code and environment scripts hosted in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub), while families of trained model variants are distributed through downstream platforms such as Hugging Face (HF). Despite this similarity, coordinating development and release activities across these platforms remains challenging, leading to misaligned timelines, inconsistent versioning practices, and barriers to effective reuse. To examine how commit activities are coordinated between GitHub and HF, we conducted an in-depth mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families comprising 904 HF model variants. Our findings show that GitHub contributors primarily focus on model version specification, code quality improvements, performance optimization, and dependency management, whereas HF contributors mainly address model documentation, dataset handling, and inference setup. We further analyze synchronization across three dimensions -- lag, type, and intensity -- revealing eight distinct synchronization patterns. The dominance of partially synchronized patterns, such as Disperse and Sparse synchronization, highlights structural disconnects in cross-platform release practices. These disconnects often result in isolated or abandoned updates, increasing the risk of incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally inconsistent models being exposed to end users. Recognizing these synchronization patterns is essential for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

### DV-VLN: Dual Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation
**Authors**: Zijun Li, Shijie Li, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:47:55Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in a complex 3D environment according to natural language instructions. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.

### Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity
**Authors**: Manuel Tonneau, Neil K. R. Seghal, Niyati Malhotra, Victor Orozco-Olvera, Ana María Muñoz Boudet, Lakshmi Subramanian, Sharath Chandra Guntuku, Valentin Hofmann

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:41:35Z

**Summary**: Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.

### Funny or Persuasive, but Not Both: Evaluating Fine-Grained Multi-Concept Control in LLMs
**Authors**: Arya Labroo, Ivaxi Sheth, Vyas Raina, Amaani Ahmed, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:36:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong generative capabilities, but many applications require explicit and \textit{fine-grained} control over specific textual concepts, such as humor, persuasiveness, or formality. Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control.

### SLIDE: Simultaneous Model Downloading and Inference at the Wireless Network Edge
**Authors**: Guanqiao Qu, Tao Li, Qian Chen, Xianhao Chen, Sheng Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:35:04Z

**Summary**: To support on-device inference, the next-generation mobile networks are expected to support real-time model downloading services to mobile users. However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes.

### STaR: Towards Effective and Stable Table Reasoning via Slow-Thinking Large Language Models
**Authors**: Huajian Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Yucong Luo, Xiaoyu Tao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:35:03Z

**Summary**: Table reasoning with large language models (LLMs) plays a critical role in building intelligent systems capable of understanding and analyzing tabular data. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face key limitations: their reasoning processes lacks depth and explicit multi-step reasoning, often relying solely on implicit language model understanding. In addition, their reasoning processes suffer from instability, primarily caused by model uncertainty. In this work, we propose STaR, a novel slow-thinking model that can achieve effective and stable table reasoning. To enable effective multi-step reasoning, we design a two-stage training framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up followed by reinforced fine-tuning (RFT). Specifically, in the SFT stage, we construct a high-quality dataset through automatic self-verification. In the RFT stage, we introduce a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning mechanism to further enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, to improve reasoning stability, we introduce trajectory-level uncertainty quantification, which fuses token-level confidence with answer-level consistency, enabling the selection of better reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STaR-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks and exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its potential for enhancing both effectiveness and stability in table reasoning.

### An Audit of Machine Learning Experiments on Software Defect Prediction
**Authors**: Giuseppe Destefanis, Leila Yousefi, Martin Shepperd, Allan Tucker, Stephen Swift, Steve Counsell, Mahir Arzoky

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:31:32Z

**Summary**: Background: Machine learning algorithms are widely used to predict defect prone software components. In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by González Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity. Conclusions: Experimental design and reporting practices vary widely, and almost half of the studies provide insufficient detail to support reproduction. The audit indicates substantial scope for improvement.

### Token-level Collaborative Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation
**Authors**: Fake Lin, Binbin Hu, Zhi Zheng, Xi Zhu, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Tong Xu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:05:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for generative recommendation by leveraging rich semantic knowledge. However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems.

### LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading
**Authors**: Chengwei Lou, Zekai Jin, Wei Tang, Guangfei Geng, Jin Yang, Lu Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:53:18Z

**Summary**: Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and a lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposes an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategies, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation. To handle the scalability issues inherent in large-scale P2P networks, a differential attention-based critic network is introduced to efficiently extract key interaction features and enhance convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed imitative expert MARL algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baseline algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This paper provides an effective solution for the real-time decision-making of the P2P electricity market by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.

### SG-CADVLM: A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation
**Authors**: Hongyi Zhao, Shuo Wang, Qijie He, Ziyuan Pu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:53:12Z

**Summary**: Autonomous vehicle safety validation requires testing on safety-critical scenarios, but these events are rare in real-world driving and costly to test due to collision risks. Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing.

### Learning Grouped Lattice Vector Quantizers for Low-Bit LLM Compression
**Authors**: Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:51:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints. Our source code is available on GitHub repository: https://github.com/xzhang9308/GLVQ.

### Collaposer: Transforming Photo Collections into Visual Assets for Storytelling with Collages
**Authors**: Jiayi Zhou, Liwenhan Xie, Jiaju Ma, Zheng Wei, Huamin Qu, Anyi Rao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:38:22Z

**Summary**: Digital collage is an artistic practice that combines image cutouts to tell stories. However, preparing cutouts from a set of photos remains a tedious and time-consuming task. A formative study identified three main challenges: 1) inefficient search for relevant photos, 2) manual image cutout, and 3) difficulty in organizing large sets of cutouts. To meet these challenges and facilitate asset preparation for collage, we propose Collaposer, a tool that transforms a collection of photos into organized, ready-to-use visual cutouts based on user-provided story descriptions. Collaposer tags, detects, and segments photos, and then uses an LLM to select central and related labels based on the user-provided story description. Collaposer presents the resulting visuals in varying sizes, clustered according to semantic hierarchy. Our evaluation shows that Collaposer effectively automates the preparation process to produce diverse sets of visual cutouts adhering to the storyline, allowing users to focus on collaging these assets for storytelling.

### Shift Parallelism: Low-Latency, High-Throughput LLM Inference for Dynamic Workloads
**Authors**: Mert Hidayetoglu, Aurick Qiao, Michael Wyatt, Jeff Rasley, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:31:58Z

**Summary**: Efficient parallelism is necessary for achieving low-latency, high-throughput inference with large language models (LLMs). Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms.   We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism.   Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution.   We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.

### From Atom to Community: Structured and Evolving Agent Memory for User Behavior Modeling
**Authors**: Yuxin Liao, Le Wu, Min Hou, Yu Wang, Han Wu, Meng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:22:15Z

**Summary**: User behavior modeling lies at the heart of personalized applications like recommender systems. With LLM-based agents, user preference representation has evolved from latent embeddings to semantic memory. While existing memory mechanisms show promise in textual dialogues, modeling non-textual behaviors remains challenging, as preferences must be inferred from implicit signals like clicks without ground truth supervision. Current approaches rely on a single unstructured summary, updated through simple overwriting. However, this is suboptimal: users exhibit multi-faceted interests that get conflated, preferences evolve yet naive overwriting causes forgetting, and sparse individual interactions necessitate collaborative signals. We present STEAM (\textit{\textbf{ST}ructured and \textbf{E}volving \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}emory}), a novel framework that reimagines how agent memory is organized and updated. STEAM decomposes preferences into atomic memory units, each capturing a distinct interest dimension with explicit links to observed behaviors. To exploit collaborative patterns, STEAM organizes similar memories across users into communities and generates prototype memories for signal propagation. The framework further incorporates adaptive evolution mechanisms, including consolidation for refining memories and formation for capturing emerging interests. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STEAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy, simulation fidelity, and diversity.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Reuse your FLOPs: Scaling RL on Hard Problems by Conditioning on Very Off-Policy Prefixes
**Authors**: Amrith Setlur, Zijian Wang, Andrew Cohen, Paria Rashidinejad, Sang Michael Xie

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:57:00Z

**Summary**: Typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for LLM reasoning waste compute on hard problems, where correct on-policy traces are rare, policy gradients vanish, and learning stalls. To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.

### MortalMATH: Evaluating the Conflict Between Reasoning Objectives and Emergency Contexts
**Authors**: Etienne Lanzeray, Stephane Meilliez, Malo Ruelle, Damien Sileo

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:55:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are increasingly optimized for deep reasoning, prioritizing the correct execution of complex tasks over general conversation. We investigate whether this focus on calculation creates a "tunnel vision" that ignores safety in critical situations. We introduce MortalMATH, a benchmark of 150 scenarios where users request algebra help while describing increasingly life-threatening emergencies (e.g., stroke symptoms, freefall). We find a sharp behavioral split: generalist models (like Llama-3.1) successfully refuse the math to address the danger. In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered. These results suggest that training models to relentlessly pursue correct answers may inadvertently unlearn the survival instincts required for safe deployment.

### Unsupervised Text Segmentation via Kernel Change-Point Detection on Sentence Embeddings
**Authors**: Mumin Jia, Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:54:34Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised text segmentation is crucial because boundary labels are expensive, subjective, and often fail to transfer across domains and granularity choices. We propose Embed-KCPD, a training-free method that represents sentences as embedding vectors and estimates boundaries by minimizing a penalized KCPD objective. Beyond the algorithmic instantiation, we develop, to our knowledge, the first dependence-aware theory for KCPD under $m$-dependent sequences, a finite-memory abstraction of short-range dependence common in language. We prove an oracle inequality for the population penalized risk and a localization guarantee showing that each true change point is recovered within a window that is small relative to segment length. To connect theory to practice, we introduce an LLM-based simulation framework that generates synthetic documents with controlled finite-memory dependence and known boundaries, validating the predicted scaling behavior. Across standard segmentation benchmarks, Embed-KCPD often outperforms strong unsupervised baselines. A case study on Taylor Swift's tweets illustrates that Embed-KCPD combines strong theoretical guarantees, simulated reliability, and practical effectiveness for text segmentation.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:51:20Z

**Summary**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled a new paradigm for bridging authorial intent and player agency in interactive narrative. We consider this paradigm through the example of Dramamancer, a system that uses an LLM to transform author-created story schemas into player-driven playthroughs. This extended abstract outlines some design techniques and evaluation considerations associated with this system.

### POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration
**Authors**: Yuxiao Qu, Amrith Setlur, Virginia Smith, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:47:21Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.

### Teaching Models to Teach Themselves: Reasoning at the Edge of Learnability
**Authors**: Shobhita Sundaram, John Quan, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Kartik Ahuja, Yann Ollivier, Julia Kempe

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:46:56Z

**Summary**: Can a model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data.

### PRECISE: Reducing the Bias of LLM Evaluations Using Prediction-Powered Ranking Estimation
**Authors**: Abhishek Divekar, Anirban Majumder

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:46:49Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the quality of search, ranking and RAG systems traditionally requires a significant number of human relevance annotations. In recent times, several deployed systems have explored the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for this task while their inherent biases prevent direct use for metric estimation. We present a statistical framework extending Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that combines minimal human annotations with LLM judgments to produce reliable estimates of metrics which require sub-instance annotations. Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions). Detailed experiments across prominent retrieval datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the variance of estimates for the business-critical Precision@K metric, while effectively correcting for LLM bias in low-resource settings.

### Dep-Search: Learning Dependency-Aware Reasoning Traces with Persistent Memory
**Authors**: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Zixuan Yan, Yanxin Shen, Wenjie Xu, Yuefeng Huang, Xinyi Wang, Jiannan Cao, Jianwei Yin, Xuhong Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:42:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when augmented with search mechanisms that enable systematic exploration of external knowledge bases. The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.

### Consistent Kernel Change-Point Detection under m-Dependence for Text Segmentation
**Authors**: Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez, Mumin Jia

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:36:37Z

**Summary**: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.

### Beyond Preferences: Learning Alignment Principles Grounded in Human Reasons and Values
**Authors**: Henry Bell, Lara Neubauer da Costa Schertel, Bochu Ding, Brandon Fain

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:27:00Z

**Summary**: A crucial consideration when developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) is the human values to which these models are aligned. In the constitutional framework of alignment models are aligned to a set of principles (the constitution) specified in natural language. However, it is unclear how to fairly determine this constitution with widespread stakeholder input. In this work we propose Grounded Constitutional AI (GCAI), a unified framework for generating constitutions of principles that are representative of both users' general expectations toward AI (general principles) and their interaction-time preferences (contextual principles). We extend the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach to generate contextual principles from human preference annotation data by leveraging human-provided \textit{reasons} for their preferences. We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \textit{values} regarding AI. We show that a constitution generated by GCAI is preferred by humans over one generated through ICAI both personally, and for widespread use in governing AI behavior. Additionally participants consider the GCAI constitution to be more morally grounded, coherent, and pluralistic.

### $α^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks
**Authors**: Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Abderrahmane Lakas, Merouane Debbah

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:25:07Z

**Summary**: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.   We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).   We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench

### HalluGuard: Demystifying Data-Driven and Reasoning-Driven Hallucinations in LLMs
**Authors**: Xinyue Zeng, Junhong Lin, Yujun Yan, Feng Guo, Liang Shi, Jun Wu, Dawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:23:09Z

**Summary**: The reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific discovery is often compromised by hallucinations. These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations.

### Next Token Knowledge Tracing: Exploiting Pretrained LLM Representations to Decode Student Behaviour
**Authors**: Max Norris, Kobi Gal, Sahan Bulathwela

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:20:30Z

**Summary**: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

### TSRBench: A Comprehensive Multi-task Multi-modal Time Series Reasoning Benchmark for Generalist Models
**Authors**: Fangxu Yu, Xingang Guo, Lingzhi Yuan, Haoqiang Kang, Hongyu Zhao, Lianhui Qin, Furong Huang, Bin Hu, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:04:54Z

**Summary**: Time series data is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and crucial for critical applications ranging from energy management to traffic control. Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBench provides a standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models. Our code and dataset are available at https://tsrbench.github.io/.

### SeNeDiF-OOD: Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection Methodology in Open-World Classification. A Case Study on Monument Style Classification
**Authors**: Ignacio Antequera-Sánchez, Juan Luis Suárez-Díaz, Rosana Montes, Francisco Herrera

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:01:46Z

**Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.

### Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for IoT Malware Detection under Data Scarcity and Drift
**Authors**: Jake Lyon, Ehsan Saeedizade, Shamik Sengupta

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:59:33Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in domains such as smart cities, transportation, and industrial systems has heightened the urgency of addressing their security vulnerabilities. IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Our results show that tree-based models achieve high accuracy and generalization, even with limited training data, while performance deteriorates over time as malware diversity increases. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive, resource-efficient ML models for securing IoT systems in real-world environments.

### Self-Distilled Reasoner: On-Policy Self-Distillation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siyan Zhao, Zhihui Xie, Mengchen Liu, Jing Huang, Guan Pang, Feiyu Chen, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:56:50Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation improves large language model (LLM) reasoning by compressing the knowledge of a teacher LLM to train smaller LLMs. On-policy distillation advances this approach by having the student sample its own trajectories while a teacher LLM provides dense token-level supervision, addressing the distribution mismatch between training and inference in off-policy distillation methods. However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving 4-8x token efficiency compared to reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and superior performance over off-policy distillation methods.

### One Adapts to Any: Meta Reward Modeling for Personalized LLM Alignment
**Authors**: Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Tiezheng Yu, Fengbin Zhu, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Wenjie Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:55:52Z

**Summary**: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.

### Reflect: Transparent Principle-Guided Reasoning for Constitutional Alignment at Scale
**Authors**: Henry Bell, Caroline Zhang, Mohammed Mobasserul Haque, Dhaval Potdar, Samia Zaman, Brandon Fain

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:54:54Z

**Summary**: The constitutional framework of alignment aims to align large language models (LLMs) with value-laden principles written in natural language (such as to avoid using biased language). Prior work has focused on parameter fine-tuning techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to instill these principles. However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require careful engineering and tuning, and often require difficult-to-obtain human annotation data. We propose \textsc{reflect}, an inference-time framework for constitutional alignment that does not require any training or data, providing a plug-and-play approach for aligning an instruction-tuned model to a set of principles. \textsc{reflect} operates entirely in-context, combining a (i) constitution-conditioned base response with post-generation (ii) self-evaluation, (iii)(a) self-critique, and (iii)(b) final revision. \textsc{reflect}'s technique of explicit in-context reasoning over principles during post-generation outperforms standard few-shot prompting and provides transparent reasoning traces. Our results demonstrate that \textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations. Finally, we show that \textsc{reflect} naturally generates useful training data for traditional parameter fine-tuning techniques, allowing for efficient scaling and the reduction of inference-time computational overhead in long-term deployment scenarios.

### An ISAC-ready Full-Duplex Backscatter Architecture for the mmWave IoT
**Authors**: Skanda Harisha, Jimmy G. D. Hester, Aline Eid

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:51:49Z

**Summary**: Achieving long-range, high-rate, concurrent two-way mmWave communication with power-constrained IoT devices is fundamental to scaling future ubiquitous sensing systems, yet the substantial power demands and high cost of mmWave hardware have long stood in the way of practical deployment. This paper presents the first mmWave full-duplex backscatter tag architecture, charting a genuinely low-cost path toward high-performance mmWave connectivity and localization for ISAC systems. The proposed tag operates at ranges beyond 45m on the uplink and beyond 200m on the downlink, delivering 20x the reach of state-of-the-art systems while being over 100x cheaper than existing mmWave backscatter platforms. Enabling this leap is a novel low-power regenerative amplifier that provides 30 dB of gain while consuming only 30 mW, paired with a regenerative rectifier that achieves state-of-the-art sensitivity down to -60 dBm. We integrate our circuits on a compact PCB and evaluate it across diverse uplink and downlink scenarios, where it achieves an downlink BER of $10^{-1}$ at 200 meters and a uplink BER of $10^{-2}$ at 45 meters, demonstrating resilient, high-quality communication even at extended ranges.

### Health-SCORE: Towards Scalable Rubrics for Improving Health-LLMs
**Authors**: Zhichao Yang, Sepehr Janghorbani, Dongxu Zhang, Jun Han, Qian Qian, Andrew Ressler, Gregory D. Lyng, Sanjit Singh Batra, Robert E. Tillman

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:34:10Z

**Summary**: Rubrics are essential for evaluating open-ended LLM responses, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. However, creating high-quality and domain-specific rubrics typically requires significant human expertise time and development cost, making rubric-based evaluation and training difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.

### From Fuzzy to Exact: The Halo Architecture for Infinite-Depth Reasoning via Rational Arithmetic
**Authors**: Hansheng Ren

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:24:34Z

**Summary**: Current paradigms in Deep Learning prioritize computational throughput over numerical precision, relying on the assumption that intelligence emerges from statistical correlation at scale. In this paper, we challenge this orthodoxy. We propose the Exactness Hypothesis: that General Intelligence (AGI), specifically high-order causal inference, requires a computational substrate capable of Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic. We argue that the "hallucinations" and logical incoherence seen in current Large Language Models (LLMs) are artifacts of IEEE 754 floating-point approximation errors accumulating over deep compositional functions. To mitigate this, we introduce the Halo Architecture, a paradigm shift to Rational Arithmetic ($\mathbb{Q}$) supported by a novel Exact Inference Unit (EIU). Empirical validation on the Huginn-0125 prototype demonstrates that while 600B-parameter scale BF16 baselines collapse in chaotic systems, Halo maintains zero numerical divergence indefinitely. This work establishes exact arithmetic as a prerequisite for reducing logical uncertainty in System 2 AGI.

### TEA-Bench: A Systematic Benchmarking of Tool-enhanced Emotional Support Dialogue Agent
**Authors**: Xingyu Sui, Yanyan Zhao, Yulin Hu, Jiahe Guo, Weixiang Zhao, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:15:27Z

**Summary**: Emotional Support Conversation requires not only affective expression but also grounded instrumental support to provide trustworthy guidance. However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents.

### Mechanistic Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:15:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models exhibit remarkable performance across diverse tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms. However, continual fine-tuning on sequential tasks induces catastrophic forgetting, where newly acquired knowledge interferes with previously learned capabilities. Despite widespread observations of this phenomenon, the mechanistic understanding remains limited. Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility. These findings establish mechanistic foundations for developing targeted mitigation strategies in continual learning systems.

### Bridging Instead of Replacing Online Coding Communities with AI through Community-Enriched Chatbot Designs
**Authors**: Junling Wang, Lahari Goswami, Gustavo Kreia Umbelino, Kiara Garcia Chau, Mrinmaya Sachan, April Yi Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:14:05Z

**Summary**: LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT have become popular tools for assisting with coding tasks. However, they often produce isolated responses and lack mechanisms for social learning or contextual grounding. In contrast, online coding communities like Kaggle offer socially mediated learning environments that foster critical thinking, engagement, and a sense of belonging. Yet, growing reliance on LLMs risks diminishing participation in these communities and weakening their collaborative value. To address this, we propose Community-Enriched AI, a design paradigm that embeds social learning dynamics into LLM-based chatbots by surfacing user-generated content and social design feature from online coding communities. Using this paradigm, we implemented a RAG-based AI chatbot leveraging resources from Kaggle to validate our design. Across two empirical studies involving 28 and 12 data science learners, respectively, we found that Community-Enriched AI significantly enhances user trust, encourages engagement with community, and effectively supports learners in solving data science tasks. We conclude by discussing design implications for AI assistance systems that bridge -- rather than replace -- online coding communities.

### Explainability Methods for Hardware Trojan Detection: A Systematic Comparison
**Authors**: Paul Whitten, Francis Wolff, Chris Papachristou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:13:00Z

**Summary**: Hardware trojan detection requires accurate identification and interpretable explanations for security engineers to validate and act on results. This work compares three explainability categories for gate-level trojan detection on the Trust-Hub benchmark: (1) domain-aware property-based analysis of 31 circuit-specific features from gate fanin patterns, flip-flop distances, and I/O connectivity; (2) case-based reasoning using k-nearest neighbors for precedent-based explanations; and (3) model-agnostic feature attribution (LIME, SHAP, gradient).   Results show different advantages per approach. Property-based analysis provides explanations through circuit concepts like "high fanin complexity near outputs indicates potential triggers." Case-based reasoning achieves 97.4% correspondence between predictions and training exemplars, offering justifications grounded in precedent. LIME and SHAP provide feature attributions with strong inter-method correlation (r=0.94, p<0.001) but lack circuit-level context for validation.   XGBoost classification achieves 46.15% precision and 52.17% recall on 11,392 test samples, a 9-fold precision improvement over prior work (Hasegawa et al.: 5.13%) while reducing false positive rates from 5.6% to 0.25%. Gradient-based attribution runs 481 times faster than SHAP but provides similar domain-opaque insights.   This work demonstrates that property-based and case-based approaches offer domain alignment and precedent-based interpretability compared to generic feature rankings, with implications for XAI deployment where practitioners must validate ML predictions.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:08:04Z

**Summary**: Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.

### Exploration vs Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward
**Authors**: Peter Chen, Xiaopeng Li, Ziniu Li, Wotao Yin, Xi Chen, Tianyi Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T17:06:02Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

### CtrlRAG: Black-box Document Poisoning Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Runqi Sui

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:58:51Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response credibility and traceability by displaying reference contexts, but this transparency simultaneously introduces a novel black-box attack vector. Existing document poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious documents into the knowledge base to manipulate RAG outputs, rely primarily on unrealistic white-box or gray-box assumptions, limiting their practical applicability. To address this gap, we propose CtrlRAG, a two-stage black-box attack that (1) constructs malicious documents containing misinformation or emotion-inducing content and injects them into the knowledge base, and (2) iteratively optimizes them using a localization algorithm and Masked Language Model (MLM) guided on reference context feedback, ensuring their retrieval priority while preserving linguistic naturalness. With only five malicious documents per target question injected into the million-document MS MARCO dataset, CtrlRAG achieves up to 90% attack success rates on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), a 30% improvement over optimal baselines, in both *Emotion Manipulation* and *Hallucination Amplification* tasks. Furthermore, we show that existing defenses fail to balance security and performance. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a dynamic *Knowledge Expansion* defense strategy based on *Parametric/Non-parametric Memory Confrontation*, blocking 78% of attacks while maintaining 95.5% system accuracy. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems and provide effective defense strategies.

### MARC: Memory-Augmented RL Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding
**Authors**: Peiran Wu, Zhuorui Yu, Yunze Liu, Chi-Hao Wu, Enmin Zhou, Junxiao Shen

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:58:19Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

### CiteGuard: Faithful Citation Attribution for LLMs via Retrieval-Augmented Validation
**Authors**: Yee Man Choi, Xuehang Guo, Yi R. Fung, Qingyun Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:50:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising assistants for scientific writing. However, there have been concerns regarding the quality and reliability of the generated text, one of which is the citation accuracy and faithfulness. While most recent work relies on methods such as LLM-as-a-Judge, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge alone is also in doubt. In this work, we reframe citation evaluation as a problem of citation attribution alignment, which assesses whether LLM-generated citations match those a human author would include for the same text. We propose CiteGuard, a retrieval-aware agent framework designed to provide more faithful grounding for citation validation. CiteGuard improves the prior baseline by 17%, and achieves up to 68.1% accuracy on the CiteME benchmark, approaching human-level performance (69.7%). It also enables the identification of alternative but valid citations and demonstrates generalization ability for cross-domain citation attribution.Our code is available at https://github.com/KathCYM/CiteGuard.

### COMETS: Coordinated Multi-Destination Video Transmission with In-Network Rate Adaptation
**Authors**: Yulong Zhang, Ying Cui, Zili Meng, Abhishek Kumar, Dirk Kutscher

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:47:45Z

**Summary**: Large-scale video streaming events attract millions of simultaneous viewers, stressing existing delivery infrastructures. Client-driven adaptation reacts slowly to shared congestion, while server-based coordination introduces scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. We present COMETS, a coordinated multi-destination video transmission framework that leverages information-centric networking principles such as request aggregation and in-network state awareness to enable scalable, fair, and adaptive rate control. COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency. The results highlight COMETS as a practical, deployable approach for next-generation scalable video delivery.

### Not Your Typical Sycophant: The Elusive Nature of Sycophancy in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shahar Ben Natan, Oren Tsur

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:45:31Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

### LLMPopcorn: Exploring LLMs as Assistants for Popular Micro-video Generation
**Authors**: Junchen Fu, Xuri Ge, Kaiwen Zheng, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Xin Xin, Yongxin Ni, Joemon M. Jose

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:44:12Z

**Summary**: In an era where micro-videos dominate platforms like TikTok and YouTube, AI-generated content is nearing cinematic quality. The next frontier is using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create viral micro-videos, a largely untapped potential that could shape the future of AI-driven content creation. To address this gap, this paper presents the first exploration of LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). We selected popcorn as the icon for this paper because it symbolizes leisure and entertainment, aligning with this study on leveraging LLMs as assistants for generating popular micro-videos that are often consumed during leisure time. Specifically, we empirically study the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? Exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 can generate micro-videos with popularity rivaling human content. Prompt enhancement further boosts results, while benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and R1 for LLMs, and LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo for video generation. This work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation and opens new research directions. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/LLMPopcorn.

### Beyond Data Privacy: New Privacy Risks for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuntao Du, Zitao Li, Ninghui Li, Bolin Ding

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:30:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.

**Authors**: Aryan Yazdan Parast, Parsa Hosseini, Hesam Asadollahzadeh, Arshia Soltani Moakhar, Basim Azam, Soheil Feizi, Naveed Akhtar

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:30:01Z

**Summary**: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

### RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems
**Authors**: Chenyang Zhu, Spencer Hong, Jingyu Wu, Kushal Chawla, Charlotte Tang, Youbing Yin, Nathan Wolfe, Erin Babinsky, Daben Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:25:46Z

**Summary**: The advent of complex, interconnected long-horizon LLM systems has made it incredibly tricky to identify where and when these systems break down. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today are limited in that they often focus on simple metrics, end-to-end outcomes, and are dependent on the perspectives of humans. In order to match the increasing complexity of these many component systems, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the nuanced logic passing through these systems. In this paper, we present RAFFLES, an offline evaluation architecture that incorporates iterative reasoning. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically identify faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess the quality of the candidate faults as well as rationales of the Judge. We evaluated RAFFLES with several benchmarks - the Who&When dataset to identify step-level faults in multi-agent systems and the ReasonEval datasets to diagnose step-level mathematical reasoning errors. RAFFLES outperforms strong baselines, achieving an accuracy of over 20% and 50% on the Who&When Hand-Crafted and Algorithmically-Generated datasets, and over 80% on the ReasonEval datasets. These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual review.

### Data Valuation for LLM Fine-Tuning: Efficient Shapley Value Approximation via Language Model Arithmetic
**Authors**: Mélissa Tamine, Otmane Sakhi, Benjamin Heymann

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:21:48Z

**Summary**: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

### FadeMem: Biologically-Inspired Forgetting for Efficient Agent Memory
**Authors**: Lei Wei, Xu Dong, Xiao Peng, Niantao Xie, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:12:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models deployed as autonomous agents face critical memory limitations, lacking selective forgetting mechanisms that lead to either catastrophic forgetting at context boundaries or information overload within them. While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems.

**Authors**: Zhiteng Li, Hanxuan Li, Junyi Wu, Kai Liu, Haotong Qin, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:04:47Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $δ$-Guided Bit Switching ($δ$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/lhxcs/DVD-Quant.

### Assessing the Quality of Mental Health Support in LLM Responses through Multi-Attribute Human Evaluation
**Authors**: Abeer Badawi, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Elahe Rahimi, Sheri Grach, Lindsay Bertrand, Lames Danok, Frank Rudzicz, Jimmy Huang, Elham Dolatabadi

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:04:19Z

**Summary**: The escalating global mental health crisis, marked by persistent treatment gaps, availability, and a shortage of qualified therapists, positions Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising avenue for scalable support. While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.

### CONQUER: Context-Aware Representation with Query Enhancement for Text-Based Person Search
**Authors**: Zequn Xie

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T16:01:33Z

**Summary**: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve pedestrian images from large galleries using natural language descriptions. This task, essential for public safety applications, is hindered by cross-modal discrepancies and ambiguous user queries. We introduce CONQUER, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges by enhancing cross-modal alignment during training and adaptively refining queries at inference. During training, CONQUER employs multi-granularity encoding, complementary pair mining, and context-guided optimal matching based on Optimal Transport to learn robust embeddings. At inference, a plug-and-play query enhancement module refines vague or incomplete queries via anchor selection and attribute-driven enrichment, without requiring retraining of the backbone. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that CONQUER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both Rank-1 accuracy and mAP, yielding notable improvements in cross-domain and incomplete-query scenarios. These results highlight CONQUER as a practical and effective solution for real-world TBPS deployment. Source code is available at https://github.com/zqxie77/CONQUER.

### Internal Deployment in the EU AI Act
**Authors**: Matteo Pistillo

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:59:30Z

**Summary**: This memorandum analyzes and stress-tests arguments in favor and against the inclusion of internal deployment within the scope of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). In doing so, it aims to offer several possible interpretative pathways to the European Commission, AI providers and deployers, courts, and the legal and policy community at large based on Articles 2(1), 2(6), 2(8) of the EU AI Act. Specifically, this memorandum first analyzes four interpretative pathways based on Article 2(1)(a)-(c) supporting the application of the EU AI Act to internally deployed AI models and systems. Then, it examines possible objections and exceptions based on Articles 2(1)(a), 2(6), and 2(8), with particular attention to the complexity of the scientific R&D exception under Article 2(6). Finally, it illustrates how Articles 2(1), 2(6), and 2(8) can be viewed as complementary to each other, once broken down to their most plausible meaning and interpreted in conjunction with Articles 3(1), 3(3), 3(4), 3(9), 3(10), 3(11), 3(12), 3(63), and Recitals 12, 13, 21, 25, 97, 109, and 110.

### CASSANDRA: Programmatic and Probabilistic Learning and Inference for Stochastic World Modeling
**Authors**: Panagiotis Lymperopoulos, Abhiramon Rajasekharan, Ian Berlot-Attwell, Stéphane Aroca-Ouellette, Kaheer Suleman

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:58:53Z

**Summary**: Building world models is essential for planning in real-world domains such as businesses. Since such domains have rich semantics, we can leverage world knowledge to effectively model complex action effects and causal relationships from limited data. In this work, we propose CASSANDRA, a neurosymbolic world modeling approach that leverages an LLM as a knowledge prior to construct lightweight transition models for planning. CASSANDRA integrates two components: (1) LLM-synthesized code to model deterministic features, and (2) LLM-guided structure learning of a probabilistic graphical model to capture causal relationships among stochastic variables. We evaluate CASSANDRA in (i) a small-scale coffee-shop simulator and (ii) a complex theme park business simulator, where we demonstrate significant improvements in transition prediction and planning over baselines.

### Resisting Manipulative Bots in Meme Coin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Yichen Luo, Yebo Feng, Jiahua Xu, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:36Z

**Summary**: Copy trading has become the dominant entry strategy in meme coin markets. However, due to the market's extreme illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from naïve copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists. We propose a manipulation-resistant copy-trading system based on a multi-agent architecture powered by a multi-modal, explainable large language model (LLM). Our system decomposes copy trading into three specialized agents for coin evaluation, wallet selection, and timing assessment. Evaluated on historical data from over 6,000 meme coins, our approach outperforms zero-shot and most statistic-driven baselines in prediction accuracy as well as all baselines in economic performance, achieving an average return of 14% for identified smart-money trades and an estimated copier return of 3% per trade under realistic market frictions. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agent-based defenses and predictability of trader profitability in adversarial meme coin markets, providing a practical foundation for robust copy trading.

### Cross-Platform Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models from Edge to Cloud GPUs
**Authors**: Amir Taherin, Juyi Lin, Arash Akbari, Arman Akbari, Pu Zhao, Weiwei Chen, David Kaeli, Yanzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:20Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.

### SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lei Zhong, Yi Yang, Changjian Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:51:20Z

**Summary**: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.

### Autiverse: Eliciting Autistic Adolescents' Daily Narratives through AI-guided Multimodal Journaling
**Authors**: Migyeong Yang, Kyungah Lee, Jinyoung Han, SoHyun Park, Young-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:44:08Z

**Summary**: Journaling can potentially serve as an effective method for autistic adolescents to improve narrative skills. However, its text-centric nature and high executive functioning demands present barriers to practice. We present Autiverse, an AI-guided multimodal journaling app for tablets that scaffolds daily narratives through conversational prompts and visual supports. Autiverse elicits key details of an adolescent-selected event through a stepwise dialogue with peer-like, customizable AI and composes them into an editable four-panel comic strip. Through a two-week deployment study with 10 autistic adolescent-parent dyads, we examine how Autiverse supports autistic adolescents to organize their daily experience and emotion. Our findings show Autiverse scaffolded adolescents' coherent narratives, while enabling parents to learn additional details of their child's events and emotions. Moreover, the customized AI peer created a comfortable space for sharing, fostering enjoyment and a strong sense of agency. Drawing on these results, we discuss implications for adaptive scaffolding across autism profiles, socio-emotionally appropriate AI peer design, and balancing autonomy with parental involvement.

### A Balanced Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Commonsense Abductive Logic
**Authors**: Joseph Cotnareanu, Didier Chetelat, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:40:26Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive formal reasoning abilities, they often break down when problems require complex proof planning. One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts.

### Computational Phenomenology of Borderline Personality Disorder: A Comparative Evaluation of LLM-Simulated Expert Personas and Human Clinical Experts
**Authors**: Marcin Moskalewicz, Anna Sterna, Karolina Drożdż, Kacper Dudzic, Marek Pokropski, Paula Flores

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:37:22Z

**Summary**: Building on a human-led thematic analysis of life-story interviews with inpatients with Borderline Personality Disorder, this study examines the capacity of large language models (OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude) to support qualitative clinical analysis. The models were evaluated through a mixed procedure. Study A involved blinded and non-blinded expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients for overlap of outputs, multidimensional validity ratings of credibility, coherence, and the substantiveness of results, and their grounding in qualitative data. In Study B, neural methods were used to embed the theme descriptions created by humans and the models in a two-dimensional vector space to provide a computational measure of the difference between human and model semantics and linguistic style. In Study C, complementary non-expert evaluations were conducted to examine the influence of thematic verbosity on the perception of human authorship and content validity. Results of all three studies revealed variable overlap with the human analysis, with models being partly indistinguishable from, and also identifying themes originally omitted by, human researchers. The findings highlight both the variability and potential of AI-augmented thematic qualitative analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias and enhance sensitivity.

### Stability as a Liability:Systematic Breakdown of Linguistic Structure in LLMs
**Authors**: Xianzhe Meng, Qiangsheng Zeng, Ling Luo, Qinghan Yang, Jiarui Hao, Wenbo Wu, Qinyu Wang, Rui Yin, Lin Qi, Renzhi Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:34:50Z

**Summary**: Training stability is typically regarded as a prerequisite for reliable optimization in large language models. In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality.

### From Classification to Ranking: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities for MBTI Personality Detection
**Authors**: Yuan Cao, Feixiang Liu, Xinyue Wang, Yihan Zhu, Hui Xu, Zheng Wang, Qiang Qiu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:28:43Z

**Summary**: Personality detection aims to measure an individual's corresponding personality traits through their social media posts. The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function. Unlike verification tasks with definitive solutions, personality assessment involves subjective interpretations and blurred boundaries between trait categories. Our reward function explicitly addresses this challenge by training LLMs to learn optimal answer rankings. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple personality detection benchmarks.

### FastInsight: Fast and Insightful Retrieval via Fusion Operators for Graph RAG
**Authors**: Seonho An, Chaejeong Hyun, Min-Soo Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:23:41Z

**Summary**: Existing Graph RAG methods aiming for insightful retrieval on corpus graphs typically rely on time-intensive processes that interleave Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.

### One Persona, Many Cues, Different Results: How Sociodemographic Cues Impact LLM Personalization
**Authors**: Franziska Weeber, Vera Neplenbroek, Jan Batzner, Sebastian Padó

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:15:58Z

**Summary**: Personalization of LLMs by sociodemographic subgroup often improves user experience, but can also introduce or amplify biases and unfair outcomes across groups. Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues.

### An LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Age of Information Optimization in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks
**Authors**: Fang Liu, Erchao Zhu, Jiedan Tan, Jingwen Tong, Taotao Wang, Shengli Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:10:09Z

**Summary**: With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous wireless networks, the Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of real-time and personalized systems. While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an "Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.

### SIPDO: Closed-Loop Prompt Optimization via Synthetic Data Feedback
**Authors**: Yaoning Yu, Ye Yu, Peiyan Zhang, Kai Wei, Haojing Luo, Haohan Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:07:30Z

**Summary**: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.

### Induce, Align, Predict: Zero-Shot Stance Detection via Cognitive Inductive Reasoning
**Authors**: Bowen Zhang, Jun Ma, Fuqiang Niu, Li Dong, Jinzhou Cao, Genan Dai

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:05:54Z

**Summary**: Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) seeks to determine the stance of text toward previously unseen targets, a task critical for analyzing dynamic and polarized online discourse with limited labeled data. While large language models (LLMs) offer zero-shot capabilities, prompting-based approaches often fall short in handling complex reasoning and lack robust generalization to novel targets. Meanwhile, LLM-enhanced methods still require substantial labeled data and struggle to move beyond instance-level patterns, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. Inspired by cognitive science, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF), a schema-driven method that bridges linguistic inputs and abstract reasoning via automatic induction and application of cognitive reasoning schemas. CIRF abstracts first-order logic patterns from raw text into multi-relational schema graphs in an unsupervised manner, and leverages a schema-enhanced graph kernel model to align input structures with schema templates for robust, interpretable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks demonstrate that CIRF not only establishes new state-of-the-art results, but also achieves comparable performance with just 30% of the labeled data, demonstrating its strong generalization and efficiency in low-resource settings.

### Generative Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Discrimination for Medical Image Diagnosis
**Authors**: Jingsong Xia, Siqi Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:05:19Z

**Summary**: In biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence has become a pivotal tool for enhancing medical diagnostics, particularly in medical image classification tasks such as detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays and breast cancer screening. However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment. The proposed method validates the feasibility of integrating generative augmentation with quantum-enhanced modeling in real-world medical imaging tasks, offering a novel research pathway for developing highly reliable medical AI systems in small-sample, highly imbalanced, and high-risk diagnostic scenarios.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:03:36Z

**Summary**: We present a family of open-source Music Foundation Models designed to advance large-scale music understanding and generation across diverse tasks and modalities. Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio-text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.

### Deconstructing Instruction-Following: A New Benchmark for Granular Evaluation of Large Language Model Instruction Compliance Abilities
**Authors**: Alberto Purpura, Li Wang, Sahil Badyal, Eugenio Beaufrand, Adam Faulkner

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:02:15Z

**Summary**: Reliably ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) follow complex instructions is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world use or isolate compliance from task success. We introduce MOSAIC (MOdular Synthetic Assessment of Instruction Compliance), a modular framework that uses a dynamically generated dataset with up to 20 application-oriented generation constraints to enable a granular and independent analysis of this capability. Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position. The analysis reveals model-specific weaknesses, uncovers synergistic and conflicting interactions between instructions, and identifies distinct positional biases such as primacy and recency effects. These granular insights are critical for diagnosing model failures and developing more reliable LLMs for systems that demand strict adherence to complex instructions.

### Unknown Unknowns: Why Hidden Intentions in LLMs Evade Detection
**Authors**: Devansh Srivastav, David Pape, Lea Schönherr

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:59:17Z

**Summary**: LLMs are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, yet their outputs can encode subtle, unintended behaviours that shape user beliefs and actions. We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of detectability failures of hidden intentions in LLMs under open-world settings, offering a foundation for understanding, inducing, and stress-testing such behaviours, and establishing a flexible taxonomy for anticipating evolving threats and informing governance.

### From Verifiable Dot to Reward Chain: Harnessing Verifiable Reference-based Rewards for Reinforcement Learning of Open-ended Generation
**Authors**: Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Qiyuan Zhang, Xingshan Zeng, Liangyou Li, Jierun Chen, Chaofan Tao, Haoli Bai, Lifeng Shang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:39:58Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) succeeds in reasoning tasks (e.g., math and code) by checking the final verifiable answer (i.e., a verifiable dot signal). However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment. We release our code and data at https://github.com/YJiangcm/RLVRR.

### Scalable Transit Delay Prediction at City Scale: A Systematic Approach with Multi-Resolution Feature Engineering and Deep Learning
**Authors**: Emna Boudabbous, Mohamed Karaa, Lokman Sboui, Julio Montecinos, Omar Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:30:50Z

**Summary**: Urban bus transit agencies need reliable, network-wide delay predictions to provide accurate arrival information to passengers and support real-time operational control. Accurate predictions help passengers plan their trips, reduce waiting time, and allow operations staff to adjust headways, dispatch extra vehicles, and manage disruptions. Although real-time feeds such as GTFS-Realtime (GTFS-RT) are now widely available, most existing delay prediction systems handle only a few routes, depend on hand-crafted features, and offer little guidance on how to design a scalable, reusable architecture.   We present a city-scale prediction pipeline that combines multi-resolution feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning. The framework generates 1,683 spatiotemporal features by exploring 23 aggregation combinations over H3 cells, routes, segments, and temporal patterns, and compresses them into 83 components using Adaptive PCA while preserving 95% of the variance. To avoid the "giant cluster" problem that occurs when dense urban areas fall into a single H3 region, we introduce a hybrid H3+topology clustering method that yields 12 balanced route clusters (coefficient of variation 0.608) and enables efficient distributed training.   We compare five model architectures on six months of bus operations from the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) network in Montréal. A global LSTM with cluster-aware features achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, outperforming transformer models by 18 to 52% while using 275 times fewer parameters. We also report multi-level evaluation at the elementary segment, segment, and trip level with walk-forward validation and latency analysis, showing that the proposed pipeline is suitable for real-time, city-scale deployment and can be reused for other networks with limited adaptation.

### Thinking on the Fly: Test-Time Reasoning Enhancement via Latent Thought Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Wengao Ye, Yan Liang, Lianlei Shan

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:30:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning, where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text. However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.

### The PIMMUR Principles: Ensuring Validity in Collective Behavior of LLM Societies
**Authors**: Jiaxu Zhou, Jen-tse Huang, Xuhui Zhou, Man Ho Lam, Xintao Wang, Hao Zhu, Wenxuan Wang, Maarten Sap

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:24:09Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to simulate human collective behaviors, yet the methodological rigor of these "AI societies" remains under-explored. Through a systematic audit of 42 recent studies, we identify six pervasive flaws-spanning agent profiles, interaction, memory, control, unawareness, and realism (PIMMUR). Our analysis reveals that 90.7% of studies violate at least one principle, undermining simulation validity. We demonstrate that frontier LLMs correctly identify the underlying social experiment in 47.6% of cases, while 65.3% of prompts exert excessive control that pre-determines outcomes. By reproducing five representative experiments (e.g., telephone game), we show that reported collective phenomena often vanish or reverse when PIMMUR principles are enforced, suggesting that many "emergent" behaviors are methodological artifacts rather than genuine social dynamics. Our findings suggest that current AI simulations may capture model-specific biases rather than universal human social behaviors, raising critical concerns about the use of LLMs as scientific proxies for human society.

### Scaling up Privacy-Preserving ML: A CKKS Implementation of Llama-2-7B
**Authors**: Jaiyoung Park, Sejin Park, Jai Hyun Park, Jung Ho Ahn, Jung Hee Cheon, Guillaume Hanrot, Jung Woo Kim, Minje Park, Damien Stehlé

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:17:23Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, privacy concerns pertaining to inference inputs keep growing. In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs.   We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference.   Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers.   Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted. On a cluster of 8~NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs, inference takes 85s for summarization and 33s for generation per output token.

### Using Large Language Models to Construct Virtual Top Managers: A Method for Organizational Research
**Authors**: Antonio Garzon-Vico, Krithika Sharon Komalapati, Arsalan Shahid, Jan Rosier

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:17:23Z

**Summary**: This study introduces a methodological framework that uses large language models to create virtual personas of real top managers. Drawing on real CEO communications and Moral Foundations Theory, we construct LLM-based participants that simulate the decision-making of individual leaders. Across three phases, we assess construct validity, reliability, and behavioral fidelity by benchmarking these virtual CEOs against human participants. Our results indicate that theoretically scaffolded personas approximate the moral judgements observed in human samples, suggesting that LLM-based personas can serve as credible and complementary tools for organizational research in contexts where direct access to executives is limited. We conclude by outlining implications for future research using LLM-based personas in organizational settings.

### Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning: Continual Learning in LLM Agents Without Gradient Updates
**Authors**: Yibo Li, Zijie Lin, Ailin Deng, Xuan Zhang, Yufei He, Shuo Ji, Tri Cao, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:16:51Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at general tasks, they inherently struggle with continual adaptation due to the frozen weights after deployment. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution but incurs prohibitive computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning (JitRL), a training-free framework that enables test-time policy optimization without any gradient updates. JitRL maintains a dynamic, non-parametric memory of experiences and retrieves relevant trajectories to estimate action advantages on-the-fly. These estimates are then used to directly modulate the LLM's output logits. We theoretically prove that this additive update rule is the exact closed-form solution to the KL-constrained policy optimization objective. Extensive experiments on WebArena and Jericho demonstrate that JitRL establishes a new state-of-the-art among training-free methods. Crucially, JitRL outperforms the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods (e.g., WebRL) while reducing monetary costs by over 30 times, offering a scalable path for continual learning agents. The code is available at https://github.com/liushiliushi/JitRL.

### On the Failure of Latent State Persistence in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jen-tse Huang, Kaiser Sun, Wenxuan Wang, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:13:17Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, whether they can sustain persistent latent states remains under-explored. The capacity to maintain and manipulate unexpressed, internal representations-analogous to human working memory-is a cornerstone of complex reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the "Latent State Persistence" (LSP) gap through three novel experiments. First, we utilize a Number Guessing Game, demonstrating that across independent queries, LLMs fail to allocate probability mass to a singular hidden choice, violating a fundamental probabilistic principle. Second, we employ a Yes-No Game to show that as the number of questions increases, LLMs suffer from "concept drift," leading to inevitable self-contradictions due to the lack of LSP. Finally, inspired by Mathematical Mentalism, we task models with tracking transformations on hidden variables, revealing a failure in variable binding and state evolution when the initial state is not explicitly present in the context. Collectively, these findings suggest that LLMs function as reactive post-hoc solvers rather than proactive planners with LSP. Our work provides a framework for evaluating the fidelity of internal representations and highlights a fundamental architectural divergence between autoregressive transformers and human-like cognition.

### Discrete Mode Decomposition Meets Shapley Value: Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet
**Authors**: Mohammad Ali Vahedifar, Qi Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:59:33Z

**Summary**: Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and high reliability to ensure stability and transparency in touch-enabled teleoperation. However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions.   Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems.

### DV-VLN: Dual Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation
**Authors**: Zijun Li, Shijie Li, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:47:55Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in a complex 3D environment according to natural language instructions. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.

### Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity
**Authors**: Manuel Tonneau, Neil K. R. Seghal, Niyati Malhotra, Victor Orozco-Olvera, Ana María Muñoz Boudet, Lakshmi Subramanian, Sharath Chandra Guntuku, Valentin Hofmann

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:41:35Z

**Summary**: Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.

### Funny or Persuasive, but Not Both: Evaluating Fine-Grained Multi-Concept Control in LLMs
**Authors**: Arya Labroo, Ivaxi Sheth, Vyas Raina, Amaani Ahmed, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:36:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong generative capabilities, but many applications require explicit and \textit{fine-grained} control over specific textual concepts, such as humor, persuasiveness, or formality. Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control.

### STaR: Towards Effective and Stable Table Reasoning via Slow-Thinking Large Language Models
**Authors**: Huajian Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Yucong Luo, Xiaoyu Tao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:35:03Z

**Summary**: Table reasoning with large language models (LLMs) plays a critical role in building intelligent systems capable of understanding and analyzing tabular data. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face key limitations: their reasoning processes lacks depth and explicit multi-step reasoning, often relying solely on implicit language model understanding. In addition, their reasoning processes suffer from instability, primarily caused by model uncertainty. In this work, we propose STaR, a novel slow-thinking model that can achieve effective and stable table reasoning. To enable effective multi-step reasoning, we design a two-stage training framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up followed by reinforced fine-tuning (RFT). Specifically, in the SFT stage, we construct a high-quality dataset through automatic self-verification. In the RFT stage, we introduce a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning mechanism to further enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, to improve reasoning stability, we introduce trajectory-level uncertainty quantification, which fuses token-level confidence with answer-level consistency, enabling the selection of better reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STaR-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks and exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its potential for enhancing both effectiveness and stability in table reasoning.

### Fair-Eye Net: A Fair, Trustworthy, Multimodal Integrated Glaucoma Full Chain AI System
**Authors**: Wenbin Wei, Suyuan Yao, Cheng Huang, Xiangyu Gao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:12:24Z

**Summary**: Glaucoma is a top cause of irreversible blindness globally, making early detection and longitudinal follow-up pivotal to preventing permanent vision loss. Current screening and progression assessment, however, rely on single tests or loosely linked examinations, introducing subjectivity and fragmented care. Limited access to high-quality imaging tools and specialist expertise further compromises consistency and equity in real-world use. To address these gaps, we developed Fair-Eye Net, a fair, reliable multimodal AI system closing the clinical loop from glaucoma screening to follow-up and risk alerting. It integrates fundus photos, OCT structural metrics, VF functional indices, and demographic factors via a dual-stream heterogeneous fusion architecture, with an uncertainty-aware hierarchical gating strategy for selective prediction and safe referral. A fairness constraint reduces missed diagnoses in disadvantaged subgroups. Experimental results show it achieved an AUC of 0.912 (96.7% specificity), cut racial false-negativity disparity by 73.4% (12.31% to 3.28%), maintained stable cross-domain performance, and enabled 3-12 months of early risk alerts (92% sensitivity, 88% specificity).

### Token-level Collaborative Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation
**Authors**: Fake Lin, Binbin Hu, Zhi Zheng, Xi Zhu, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Tong Xu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T13:05:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for generative recommendation by leveraging rich semantic knowledge. However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems.

### LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading
**Authors**: Chengwei Lou, Zekai Jin, Wei Tang, Guangfei Geng, Jin Yang, Lu Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:53:18Z

**Summary**: Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and a lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposes an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategies, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation. To handle the scalability issues inherent in large-scale P2P networks, a differential attention-based critic network is introduced to efficiently extract key interaction features and enhance convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed imitative expert MARL algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baseline algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This paper provides an effective solution for the real-time decision-making of the P2P electricity market by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.

### SG-CADVLM: A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation
**Authors**: Hongyi Zhao, Shuo Wang, Qijie He, Ziyuan Pu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:53:12Z

**Summary**: Autonomous vehicle safety validation requires testing on safety-critical scenarios, but these events are rare in real-world driving and costly to test due to collision risks. Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing.

### Learning Grouped Lattice Vector Quantizers for Low-Bit LLM Compression
**Authors**: Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:51:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints. Our source code is available on GitHub repository: https://github.com/xzhang9308/GLVQ.

### Collaposer: Transforming Photo Collections into Visual Assets for Storytelling with Collages
**Authors**: Jiayi Zhou, Liwenhan Xie, Jiaju Ma, Zheng Wei, Huamin Qu, Anyi Rao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:38:22Z

**Summary**: Digital collage is an artistic practice that combines image cutouts to tell stories. However, preparing cutouts from a set of photos remains a tedious and time-consuming task. A formative study identified three main challenges: 1) inefficient search for relevant photos, 2) manual image cutout, and 3) difficulty in organizing large sets of cutouts. To meet these challenges and facilitate asset preparation for collage, we propose Collaposer, a tool that transforms a collection of photos into organized, ready-to-use visual cutouts based on user-provided story descriptions. Collaposer tags, detects, and segments photos, and then uses an LLM to select central and related labels based on the user-provided story description. Collaposer presents the resulting visuals in varying sizes, clustered according to semantic hierarchy. Our evaluation shows that Collaposer effectively automates the preparation process to produce diverse sets of visual cutouts adhering to the storyline, allowing users to focus on collaging these assets for storytelling.

### Shift Parallelism: Low-Latency, High-Throughput LLM Inference for Dynamic Workloads
**Authors**: Mert Hidayetoglu, Aurick Qiao, Michael Wyatt, Jeff Rasley, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:31:58Z

**Summary**: Efficient parallelism is necessary for achieving low-latency, high-throughput inference with large language models (LLMs). Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms.   We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism.   Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution.   We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.

### From Atom to Community: Structured and Evolving Agent Memory for User Behavior Modeling
**Authors**: Yuxin Liao, Le Wu, Min Hou, Yu Wang, Han Wu, Meng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:22:15Z

**Summary**: User behavior modeling lies at the heart of personalized applications like recommender systems. With LLM-based agents, user preference representation has evolved from latent embeddings to semantic memory. While existing memory mechanisms show promise in textual dialogues, modeling non-textual behaviors remains challenging, as preferences must be inferred from implicit signals like clicks without ground truth supervision. Current approaches rely on a single unstructured summary, updated through simple overwriting. However, this is suboptimal: users exhibit multi-faceted interests that get conflated, preferences evolve yet naive overwriting causes forgetting, and sparse individual interactions necessitate collaborative signals. We present STEAM (\textit{\textbf{ST}ructured and \textbf{E}volving \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}emory}), a novel framework that reimagines how agent memory is organized and updated. STEAM decomposes preferences into atomic memory units, each capturing a distinct interest dimension with explicit links to observed behaviors. To exploit collaborative patterns, STEAM organizes similar memories across users into communities and generates prototype memories for signal propagation. The framework further incorporates adaptive evolution mechanisms, including consolidation for refining memories and formation for capturing emerging interests. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STEAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy, simulation fidelity, and diversity.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:20:18Z

**Summary**: Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B). Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve **56.1%** and **58.5%** resolution rates, respectively, which are ...

### Do not be greedy, Think Twice: Sampling and Selection for Document-level Information Extraction
**Authors**: Mikel Zubillaga, Oscar Sainz, Oier Lopez de Lacalle, Eneko Agirre

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:53:08Z

**Summary**: Document-level Information Extraction (DocIE) aims to produce an output template with the entities and relations of interest occurring in the given document. Standard practices include prompting decoder-only LLMs using greedy decoding to avoid output variability. Rather than treating this variability as a limitation, we show that sampling can produce substantially better solutions than greedy decoding, especially when using reasoning models. We thus propose ThinkTwice, a sampling and selection framework in which the LLM generates multiple candidate templates for a given document, and a selection module chooses the most suitable one. We introduce both an unsupervised method that exploits agreement across generated outputs, and a supervised selection method using reward models trained on labeled DocIE data. To address the scarcity of golden reasoning trajectories for DocIE, we propose a rejection-sampling-based method to generate silver training data that pairs output templates with reasoning traces. Our experiments show the validity of unsupervised and supervised ThinkTwice, consistently outperforming greedy baselines and the state-of-the-art.

### EntroLLM: Entropy Encoded Weight Compression for Efficient Large Language Model Inference on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Arnab Sanyal, Gourav Datta, Prithwish Mukherjee, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Michael Orshansky

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:44:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across tasks, but face storage and compute challenges on edge devices. We propose EntroLLM, a compression framework combining mixed quantization and entropy coding to reduce storage while preserving accuracy. We use a combination of unsigned and asymmetric quantization. Tensor-level quantization produces an entropy-reducing effect, increasing weight compressibility, and improving downstream Huffman encoding by $7\times$ (8-bit) and $11.3\times$ (4-bit) over state-of-the-art methods. Huffman coding further reduces memory bandwidth demands, while a parallel decoding strategy enables efficient weight retrieval with minimal latency. Experiments on edge-scale LLMs (smolLM-1.7B, phi3-mini-4k, mistral-7B) show up to $30\%$ storage savings over uint8 and $65\%$ over uint4 models, with $31.9-146.6\%$ faster inference on memory-limited devices like the NVIDIA JETSON P3450. EntroLLM requires no retraining and is compatible with existing post-training quantization pipelines, making it practical for edge LLM deployment.

### Prism: Towards Lowering User Cognitive Load in LLMs via Complex Intent Understanding
**Authors**: Zenghua Liao, Jinzhi Liao, Xiang Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:38:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.

### ARMOR: Agentic Reasoning for Methods Orchestration and Reparameterization for Robust Adversarial Attacks
**Authors**: Gabriel Lee Jun Rong, Christos Korgialas, Dion Jia Xu Ho, Pai Chet Ng, Xiaoxiao Miao, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:36:34Z

**Summary**: Existing automated attack suites operate as static ensembles with fixed sequences, lacking strategic adaptation and semantic awareness. This paper introduces the Agentic Reasoning for Methods Orchestration and Reparameterization (ARMOR) framework to address these limitations. ARMOR orchestrates three canonical adversarial primitives, Carlini-Wagner (CW), Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), and Spatially Transformed Attacks (STA) via Vision Language Models (VLM)-guided agents that collaboratively generate and synthesize perturbations through a shared ``Mixing Desk". Large Language Models (LLMs) adaptively tune and reparameterize parallel attack agents in a real-time, closed-loop system that exploits image-specific semantic vulnerabilities. On standard benchmarks, ARMOR achieves improved cross-architecture transfer and reliably fools both settings, delivering a blended output for blind targets and selecting the best attack or blended attacks for white-box targets using a confidence-and-SSIM score.

### Hierarchical Text Classification with LLM-Refined Taxonomies
**Authors**: Jonas Golde, Nicolaas Jedema, Ravi Krishnan, Phong Le

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:28:32Z

**Summary**: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) depends on taxonomies that organize labels into structured hierarchies. However, many real-world taxonomies introduce ambiguities, such as identical leaf names under similar parent nodes, which prevent language models (LMs) from learning clear decision boundaries. In this paper, we present TaxMorph, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform entire taxonomies through operations such as renaming, merging, splitting, and reordering. Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases. These findings suggest that LLM-guided refinement creates taxonomies that are more compatible with how models learn, improving HTC performance.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:28:24Z

**Summary**: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:26:57Z

**Summary**: City council minutes are typically lengthy and formal documents with a bureaucratic writing style. Although publicly available, their structure often makes it difficult for citizens or journalists to efficiently find information. In this demo, we present CitiLink, a platform designed to transform unstructured municipal meeting minutes into structured and searchable data, demonstrating how NLP and IR can enhance the accessibility and transparency of local government. The system employs LLMs to extract metadata, discussed subjects, and voting outcomes, which are then indexed in a database to support full-text search with BM25 ranking and faceted filtering through a user-friendly interface. The developed system was built over a collection of 120 minutes made available by six Portuguese municipalities. To assess its usability, CitiLink was tested through guided sessions with municipal personnel, providing insights into how real users interact with the system. In addition, we evaluated Gemini's performance in extracting relevant information from the minutes, highlighting its effectiveness in data extraction.

### Gaze Prediction in Virtual Reality Without Eye Tracking Using Visual and Head Motion Cues
**Authors**: Christos Petrou, Harris Partaourides, Athanasios Balomenos, Yannis Kopsinis, Sotirios Chatzis

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:26:27Z

**Summary**: Gaze prediction plays a critical role in Virtual Reality (VR) applications by reducing sensor-induced latency and enabling computationally demanding techniques such as foveated rendering, which rely on anticipating user attention. However, direct eye tracking is often unavailable due to hardware limitations or privacy concerns. To address this, we present a novel gaze prediction framework that combines Head-Mounted Display (HMD) motion signals with visual saliency cues derived from video frames. Our method employs UniSal, a lightweight saliency encoder, to extract visual features, which are then fused with HMD motion data and processed through a time-series prediction module. We evaluate two lightweight architectures, TSMixer and LSTM, for forecasting future gaze directions. Experiments on the EHTask dataset, along with deployment on commercial VR hardware, show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines such as Center-of-HMD and Mean Gaze. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of predictive gaze modeling in reducing perceptual lag and enhancing natural interaction in VR environments where direct eye tracking is constrained.

### An O-RAN Framework for AI/ML-Based Localization with OpenAirInterface and FlexRIC
**Authors**: Nada Bouknana, Mohsen Ahadi, Florian Kaltenberger, Robert Schmidt

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:15:44Z

**Summary**: Localization is increasingly becoming an integral component of wireless cellular networks. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based localization algorithms presents potential for enhancing localization accuracy. Nevertheless, current standardization efforts in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) and the O-RAN Alliance do not support AI/ML-based localization. In order to close this standardization gap, this paper describes an O-RAN framework that enables the integration of AI/ML-based localization algorithms for real-time deployments and testing. Specifically, our framework includes an O-RAN E2 Service Model (E2SM) and the corresponding radio access network (RAN) function, which exposes the Uplink Sounding Reference Signal (UL-SRS) channel estimates from the E2 agent to the Near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). Moreover, our framework includes, as an example, a real-time localization external application (xApp), which leverages the custom E2SM-SRS in order to execute continuous inference on a trained Channel Charting (CC) model, which is an emerging self-supervised method for radio-based localization. Our framework is implemented with OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, democratizing access to AI-driven positioning research and fostering collaboration. Furthermore, we validate our approach with the CC xApp in real-world conditions using an O-RAN based localization testbed at EURECOM. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework in enabling real-time AI/ML localization and show the potential of O-RAN in empowering positioning use cases for next-generation AI-native networks.

### Constructing and Benchmarking: a Labeled Email Dataset for Text-Based Phishing and Spam Detection Framework
**Authors**: Rebeka Toth, Tamas Bisztray, Richard Dubniczky

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:12:45Z

**Summary**: Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.

### Integrating HAPS, LEO, and Terrestrial Networks: A Cost-Performance Study for IoT Connectivity
**Authors**: Jean Michel de Souza Sant'Ana, Felipe Augusto Tondo, Nurul Huda Mahmood, Aamir Mahmood

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:10:41Z

**Summary**: This work evaluates the potential of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as alternative or complementary systems to enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. We first analyze the transmission erasure probability under different connectivity configurations, including only HAPS or LEO satellites, as well as hybrid architectures that integrate both aerial/spatial and terrestrial infrastructures. To make the analysis more realistic, we considered movement of LEO satellites regarding a fixed region, elevation angle between gateway and devices, and different fading models for terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication. We also analyze LR-FHSS (Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) random access uplink technology as a potential use case for IoT connectivity, showing the scalability impact of the scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that HAPS can effectively complement sparse terrestrial networks and improve the performance of satellite-based systems in specific scenarios. Furthermore, considering the deployment and operational costs, respectively, CAPEX and OPEX, the economic analysis reveals that although HAPS exhibits higher costs, these remain within a comparable order of magnitude to LEO and terrestrial deployments. In addition, specific use cases, such as natural disasters, transform HAPS into a competitive technology for conventional infrastructures.

### ABCD-LINK: Annotation Bootstrapping for Cross-Document Fine-Grained Links
**Authors**: Serwar Basch, Ilia Kuznetsov, Tom Hope, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:09:33Z

**Summary**: Understanding fine-grained links between documents is crucial for many applications, yet progress is limited by the lack of efficient methods for data curation. To address this limitation, we introduce a domain-agnostic framework for bootstrapping sentence-level cross-document links from scratch. Our approach (1) generates and validates semi-synthetic datasets of linked documents, (2) uses these datasets to benchmark and shortlist the best-performing linking approaches, and (3) applies the shortlisted methods in large-scale human-in-the-loop annotation of natural text pairs. We apply the framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves a 73% human approval rate for suggested links, more than doubling the acceptance of strong retrievers alone.

### Can Good Writing Be Generative? Expert-Level AI Writing Emerges through Fine-Tuning on High-Quality Books
**Authors**: Tuhin Chakrabarty, Paramveer S. Dhillon

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T10:59:21Z

**Summary**: Creative writing has long been considered a uniquely human endeavor, requiring voice and style that machines could not replicate. This assumption is challenged by Generative AI that can emulate thousands of author styles in seconds with negligible marginal labor. To understand this better, we conducted a behavioral experiment where 28 MFA writers (experts) competed against three LLMs in emulating 50 critically acclaimed authors. Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes "good writing." These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor.

### Code over Words: Overcoming Semantic Inertia via Code-Grounded Reasoning
**Authors**: Manjie Xu, Isabella Yin, Xinyi Tu, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T10:58:52Z

**Summary**: LLMs struggle with Semantic Inertia: the inability to inhibit pre-trained priors (e.g., "Lava is Dangerous") when dynamic, in-context rules contradict them. We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting "Lava is Safe"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors.

### Zero- to low-field J-spectroscopy with a diamond magnetometer
**Authors**: Muhib Omar, Jingyan Xu, Raphael Kircher, Pouya Sharbati, Shaowen Zhang, Georgios Chatzidrosos, James Eills, Roman Picazo-Frutos, Dmitry Budker, Danila A. Barskiy, Arne Wickenbrock

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T10:56:40Z

**Summary**: We report measurements of zero- to ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) signals at frequencies of a few hertz with a diamond-based magnetic sensor. The sensing diamond is a truncated pyramid with 0.18 mm height and a 0.5 mm x 0.5mm base. The minimum stand-off distance is < 1 mm, and the sensor sensitivity is 13 pT/(Hz)^(1/2) at frequencies f above 5 Hz with 1/f-like behavior at lower frequencies. NMR signals were generated via signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) parahydrogen-based hyperpolarization resulting in zero-field signals at 1.7 Hz and 3.4 Hz corresponding to the expected hetero-nuclear J-coupling pattern of acetonitrile. This work demonstrates a magnet-free platform for detecting chemically specific NMR signals at ultra-low frequencies paving the way for portable noninvasive diagnostics in microscopic sample volumes for biomedicine, industrial sensing through metal enclosures, and field-deployable quantum analytical devices.

### When Domain Pretraining Interferes with Instruction Alignment: An Empirical Study of Adapter Merging in Medical LLMs
**Authors**: Junyi Zou

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T10:54:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show strong general capability but often struggle with medical terminology precision and safety-critical instruction following. We present a case study for adapter interference in safety-critical domains using a 14B-parameter base model through a two-stage LoRA pipeline: (1) domain-adaptive pre-training (PT) to inject broad medical knowledge via continued pre-training (DAPT), and (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model with medical question-answering behaviors through instruction-style data. To balance instruction-following ability and domain knowledge retention, we propose Weighted Adapter Merging, linearly combining SFT and PT adapters before exporting a merged base-model checkpoint. On a held-out medical validation set (F5/F6), the merged model achieves BLEU-4 = 16.38, ROUGE-1 = 20.42, ROUGE-2 = 4.60, and ROUGE-L = 11.54 under a practical decoding configuration. We further analyze decoding sensitivity and training stability with loss curves and controlled decoding comparisons.

### Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers
**Authors**: Neil Dowling, Maxwell T. West, Angus Southwell, Azar C. Nakhl, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman, Kavan Modi

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T10:52:29Z

**Summary**: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.
