 ### KV-Auditor: Auditing Local Differential Privacy for Correlated Key-Value   Estimation
**Authors**: Jingnan Xu, Leixia Wang, Xiaofeng Meng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:17:24Z

**Summary**: To protect privacy for data-collection-based services, local differential privacy (LDP) is widely adopted due to its rigorous theoretical bound on privacy loss. However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle implementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this, auditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data. However, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and federated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with limited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus solely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving correlated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation for keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.   To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based key-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower bounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary output predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing unbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we classify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and non-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal KV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor for large domains with limited samples. For interactive mechanisms, we design a segmentation strategy to capture incremental privacy leakage across iterations. Finally, we perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering insights for optimizing LDP-based key-value estimators.

### Dynamic Quality-Latency Aware Routing for LLM Inference in Wireless   Edge-Device Networks
**Authors**: Rui Bao, Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:55:05Z

**Summary**: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

**Authors**: Mukund Choudhary, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Gaurja Aeron, Antara Raaghavi Bhattacharya, Dang Khoa Dang Dinh, Ikhlasul Akmal Hanif, Daria Kotova, Ekaterina Kochmar, Monojit Choudhury

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:53:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

### ElasticMM: Efficient Multimodal LLMs Serving with Elastic Multimodal   Parallelism
**Authors**: Zedong Liu, Shenggan Cheng, Guangming Tan, Yang You, Dingwen Tao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:27:30Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

### A Survey on Diffusion Language Models
**Authors**: Tianyi Li, Mingda Chen, Bowei Guo, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T17:47:22Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

**Authors**: Parsa Omidi, Xingshuai Huang, Axel Laborieux, Bahareh Nikpour, Tianyu Shi, Armaghan Eshaghi

**Updated**: 2025-08-16T03:17:35Z

**Summary**: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration. This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles, including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation), memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing, forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures.

### FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Zhenyu Ning, Minyi Guo, Jieru Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T16:12:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

### BitDecoding: Unlocking Tensor Cores for Long-Context LLMs with Low-Bit   KV Cache
**Authors**: Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Luo Mai, Ting Cao, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T15:37:43Z

**Summary**: The rise of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) amplifies memory and bandwidth demands during autoregressive decoding, as the Key-Value (KV) cache grows with each generated token. Low-bit KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) can reduce memory footprint while preserving accuracy, but existing systems suffer from slow decoding due to their exclusive reliance on CUDA cores, neglecting Tensor Cores (the primary source of compute on modern GPUs). We present BitDecoding, a new long-context LLM inference system with a low-bit KV cache. BitDecoding enables efficient low-bit KV-cache decoding by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. It introduces methods for automatically inducing optimized layouts to exploit Tensor Cores, along with warp-level parallelization strategies for dequantization. For unified system support, BitDecoding includes a query transformation module supporting diverse attention variants, a quantization kernel that supports both tensor-wise and channel-wise scaling used in various quantization algorithms with high performance, and a dequantization kernel with a software-defined pipeline to coordinate CUDA and Tensor Cores execution for mixed-precision operations. Evaluated on RTX 4090, A100, and H100, BitDecoding accelerates decoding by up to 7.5x, 4.8x, and 8.9x, respectively, over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, and surpasses the state-of-the-art low-bit system QServe by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K context, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, showing substantial improvements for long-context generation. The code is available at https://github.com/DD-DuDa/BitDecoding.

### EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation
**Authors**: Zixiang Yang, Yue Ma, Yinhan Zhang, Shanhui Mo, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T14:11:48Z

**Summary**: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

**Authors**: Mengyao Li, Qiaolun Zhang, Zongshuai Yang, Stefano Bregni, Alberto Gatto, Raouf Boutaba, Massimo Tornatore

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T13:10:43Z

**Summary**: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests (maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack, and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover, we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR) for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and scalability.

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T10:26:51Z

**Summary**: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

### ASPD: Unlocking Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding by Exploring Intrinsic   Parallelism in LLMs
**Authors**: Keyu Chen, Zhifeng Shen, Daohai Yu, Haoqian Wu, Wei Wen, Jianfeng He, Ruizhi Qiao, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T09:04:56Z

**Summary**: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

### Yet Another Mirage of Breaking MIRAGE: Debunking Occupancy-based   Side-Channel Attacks on Fully Associative Randomized Caches
**Authors**: Chris Cao, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T08:04:15Z

**Summary**: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from fundamental modeling flaws. Most critically, the authors' simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

### NanoControl: A Lightweight Framework for Precise and Efficient Control   in Diffusion Transformer
**Authors**: Shanyuan Liu, Jian Zhu, Junda Lu, Yue Gong, Liuzhuozheng Li, Bo Cheng, Yuhang Ma, Liebucha Wu, Xiaoyu Wu, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T07:54:44Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.

### XQuant: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache   Rematerialization
**Authors**: Aditya Tomar, Coleman Hooper, Minjae Lee, Haocheng Xi, Rishabh Tiwari, Wonjun Kang, Luca Manolache, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-08-14T06:52:38Z

**Summary**: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

### RocketKV: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Two-Stage KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Payman Behnam, Yaosheng Fu, Ritchie Zhao, Po-An Tsai, Zhiding Yu, Alexey Tumanov

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T17:55:58Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme. The source code is available here: https://github.com/NVlabs/RocketKV.

### Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action   Pretraining
**Authors**: Zijian Song, Sihan Qin, Tianshui Chen, Liang Lin, Guangrun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T13:54:51Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### Re-thinking Memory-Bound Limitations in CGRAs
**Authors**: Xiangfeng Liu, Zhe Jiang, Anzhen Zhu, Xiaomeng Han, Mingsong Lyu, Qingxu Deng, Nan Guan

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T07:40:25Z

**Summary**: Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to 6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T06:13:36Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

### Advancing Reliable Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models under   Visual Variations
**Authors**: Yiwen Liang, Hui Chen, Yizhe Xiong, Zihan Zhou, Mengyao Lyu, Zijia Lin, Shuaicheng Niu, Sicheng Zhao, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code: https://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T04:03:10Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache   in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zhifan Luo, Shuo Shao, Su Zhang, Lijing Zhou, Yuke Hu, Chenxu Zhao, Zhihao Liu, Zhan Qin

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T02:48:25Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

**Authors**: Justin London

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T01:39:09Z

**Summary**: Conventional 6T SRAM is used in microprocessors in the cache memory design. The basic 6T SRAM cell and a 6 bit memory array layout are designed in LEdit. The design and analysis of key SRAM components, sense amplifiers, decoders, write drivers and precharge circuits are also provided. The pulse voltage waveforms generated for read and write operations as well as Q and Qbar nodes are simulated in LTSpice. Parasitic capacitances are extracted and their impact on the waveforms analyzed. Static noise margin, propagation delays, and power dissipation are calculated. Comparison of SRAM read and write operational performance using CMOS transistors is made with edge-triggered D flip flops. If certain size area and ratio constraints are satisfied, the 6T cell with CMOS transistors will possess stability, speed, and power efficiency. Both theoretical and simulated results are given.

### Scalable Graph Indexing using GPUs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor   Search
**Authors**: Zhonggen Li, Xiangyu Ke, Yifan Zhu, Bocheng Yu, Baihua Zheng, Yunjun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-08-13T01:39:03Z

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves 1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

### Harnessing Input-Adaptive Inference for Efficient VLN
**Authors**: Dongwoo Kang, Akhil Perincherry, Zachary Coalson, Aiden Gabriel, Stefan Lee, Sanghyun Hong

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T18:05:33Z

**Summary**: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

### READER: Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Maxim Divilkovskiy, Vitaly Malygin, Sergey Zlobin, Sultan Isali, Vasily Kalugin, Stanislav Ilyushin, Nuriza Aitassova, Yi Fei, Zeng Weidi

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T16:47:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

### Retrospective Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context Generation
**Authors**: Seonghwan Choi, Beomseok Kang, Dongwon Jo, Jae-Joon Kim

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T15:11:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache, RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by up to 21.9\%.

### TaoCache: Structure-Maintained Video Generation Acceleration
**Authors**: Zhentao Fan, Zongzuo Wang, Weiwei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T14:40:36Z

**Summary**: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.

### Keep Your Friends Close: Leveraging Affinity Groups to Accelerate AI   Inference Workflows
**Authors**: Thiago Garrett, Weijia Song, Roman Vitenberg, Ken Birman

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T10:43:55Z

**Summary**: AI inference workflows are typically structured as a pipeline or graph of AI programs triggered by events. As events occur, the AIs perform inference or classification tasks under time pressure to respond or take some action. Standard techniques that reduce latency in other streaming settings (such as caching and optimization-driven scheduling) are of limited value because AI data access patterns (models, databases) change depending on the triggering event: a significant departure from traditional streaming. In this work, we propose a novel affinity grouping mechanism that makes it easier for developers to express application-specific data access correlations, enabling coordinated management of data objects in server clusters hosting streaming inference tasks. Our proposals are thus complementary to other approaches such as caching and scheduling. Experiments confirm the limitations of standard techniques, while showing that the proposed mechanism is able to maintain significantly lower latency as workload and scale-out increase, and yet requires only minor code changes.

### From Slow Bidirectional to Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tianwei Yin, Qiang Zhang, Richard Zhang, William T. Freeman, Fredo Durand, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T05:51:37Z

**Summary**: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

### Rigorous quantum calculations for atom-molecule chemical reactions in   electric fields: from single to multiple partial wave regimes
**Authors**: Timur V. Tscherbul, Roman V. Krems

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T03:33:15Z

**Summary**: We present an efficient method for rigorous quantum calculations of cross sections for atom-molecule reactive scattering in the presence of a dc electric field. The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete set of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the interactions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted for in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational challenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{115}$, 023201 (2015)] is addressed by an efficient asymptotic frame transformation between the hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in the presence of an external field. Using accurate {\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical reactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$ $\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field strength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical reaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions between reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the F + HD $\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for state-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our calculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the proper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics. While reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant effects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish when the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased.

### Semantic Caching for Low-Cost LLM Serving: From Offline Learning to   Online Adaptation
**Authors**: Xutong Liu, Baran Atalar, Xiangxiang Dai, Jinhang Zuo, Siwei Wang, John C. S. Lui, Wei Chen, Carlee Joe-Wong

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T02:51:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

### Follow-Your-Shape: Shape-Aware Image Editing via Trajectory-Guided   Region Control
**Authors**: Zeqian Long, Mingzhe Zheng, Kunyu Feng, Xinhua Zhang, Hongyu Liu, Harry Yang, Linfeng Zhang, Qifeng Chen, Yue Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T02:27:05Z

**Summary**: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

### Profiling Large Language Model Inference on Apple Silicon: A   Quantization Perspective
**Authors**: Afsara Benazir, Felix Xiaozhu Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T00:06:34Z

**Summary**: A systematic understanding of Apple Silicon is lacking in the current landscape of hardware efficiency; research focus is largely centered on accelerating GPUs for large-scale training or inference on CUDA devices. This paper investigates Apple Silicon's unique memory architecture that offers a unified memory integrating CPU and GPU memory and its implications for on-device LLM inference.   We decipher myths about whether Apple Silicon is efficient for on-device inference compared to competitors such as NVIDIA GPUs by directly conducting latency and throughput comparison benchmarks. We explain the performance gap between them through profiling low level hardware metrics - ALU utilization, memory bandwidth, buffer usage, cache residency etc. at runtime. We draw several insights regarding performance bottlenecks such as dequantization overhead, compute throughput and memory bandwidth. We debunk existing false claims regarding large language model inference such as compressing models to lower bit precision is a defacto promise for faster inference across all hardware platforms. We find that the large unified memory enables Apple Silicon to be both cost effective and efficient against NVIDIA GPUs for ultra large language models.   Our large scale evaluation on 5 hardware testbeds incorporating three Apple M-series devices: M2 Ultra, M2 Max and M4 Pro and two NVIDIA GPUs: NVIDIA RTX A6000, a multi GPU setup with 2xNVIDIA RTX A6000, 5 model scales ranging from 8B to 405B parameters and 14 quantization schemes gives an understanding of how Apple Silicon fits within the paradigm of on-device LLM inference. Our analysis reveals multiple resource interdependencies and unexpected findings, while also quantifying established insights. To the best of our knowledge, this study makes the first attempt to present a thorough characterization and analysis of Apple Silicon for on-device inference.

### Architecting Long-Context LLM Acceleration with Packing-Prefetch   Scheduler and Ultra-Large Capacity On-Chip Memories
**Authors**: Ming-Yen Lee, Faaiq Waqar, Hanchen Yang, Muhammed Ahosan Ul Karim, Harsono Simka, Shimeng Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T20:30:31Z

**Summary**: Long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference faces increasing compute bottlenecks as attention calculations scale with context length, primarily due to the growing KV-cache transfer overhead that saturates High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). While prefetching techniques mitigate cache misses by fetching KV data in advance, their spatial and temporal benefits present new opportunities to exploit. This work proposes a packing-prefetch scheduling architecture with monolithic 3D (M3D) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible embedded memories with ultra-large on-chip capacity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. Our optimizations demonstrate 8.06x decode speedup and 1.83x overall latency reduction on Llama3.1-8B using TPUv6e-like hardware with additional 512MB BEOL memories over the serial execution. Evaluations of multi-request workloads on TPU-like architectures show 1.7x-2.4x throughput improvement and 1.5x-2.4x HBM bandwidth reduction compared to packing-only methods on Llama3.1-8B and Llama3.1-70B models. With the co-design of packing, prefetching, and BEOL memories, our approach alleviates HBM constraints and enables efficient long-context LLM inference.

### Selective KV-Cache Sharing to Mitigate Timing Side-Channels in LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Kexin Chu, Zecheng Lin, Dawei Xiang, Zixu Shen, Jianchang Su, Cheng Chu, Yiwei Yang, Wenhui Zhang, Wenfei Wu, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T19:55:44Z

**Summary**: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT), making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and (iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method, SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from 50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM inference.

### Numerical computation of linearized KV and the Deligne-Drinfeld and   Broadhurst-Kreimer conjectures
**Authors**: Florian Naef, Thomas Willwacher

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:28:28Z

**Summary**: We compute numerically the dimensions of the graded quotients of the linearized Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra lkv in low weight, confirming a conjecture of Raphael-Schneps in those weights. The Lie algebra lkv appears in a chain of inclusions of Lie algebras, including also the linearized double shuffle Lie algebra and the (depth associated graded of the) Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra. Hence our computations also allow us to check the validity of the Deligne-Drinfeld conjecture on the structure of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group up to weight 29, and (a version of) the the Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture on the number of multiple zeta values for a range of weight-depth pairs significantly exceeding the previous bounds. Our computations also verify a conjecture by Alekseev-Torossian on the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra up to weight 29.

### From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   TaylorSeers
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Junjie Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:15:27Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

**Summary**: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical, AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance, effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation. Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns. These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration, ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

### DiTVR: Zero-Shot Diffusion Transformer for Video Restoration
**Authors**: Sicheng Gao, Nancy Mehta, Zongwei Wu, Radu Timofte

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:54:45Z

**Summary**: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands, preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

### SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by   Exploiting Temporal Continuity
**Authors**: Kunyun Wang, Shuo Yang, Jieru Zhao, Wenchao Ding, Quan Chen, Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:10:21Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

### CAOTE: KV Cache Selection for LLMs via Attention Output Error-Based   Token Eviction
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-08-16T23:41:48Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### Adaptive Cache Enhancement for Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language   Models
**Authors**: Khanh-Binh Nguyen, Phuoc-Nguyen Bui, Hyunseung Choo, Duc Thanh Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T03:03:34Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks, particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.

### CoMoE: Collaborative Optimization of Expert Aggregation and Offloading   for MoE-based LLMs at Edge
**Authors**: Muqing Li, Ning Li, Xin Yuan, Wenchao Xu, Quan Chen, Song Guo, Haijun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-10T14:05:36Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures as a promising solution to scale model capacity while controlling computational costs. However, deploying MoE models in resource-constrained mobile edge computing environments presents significant challenges due to their large memory footprint and dynamic expert activation patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic resource-aware collaborative optimization framework that jointly optimizes expert aggregation granularity and offloading strategies based on real-time device resource states, network conditions, and input characteristics in mobile edge environments, denoted as CoMoE. In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze existing expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter merging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying their limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert offloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert caching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the interdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The CoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility and varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across heterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds demonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage compared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing expert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability. For large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE reduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on resource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support much smaller models.

### CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal   Diffusion
**Authors**: Jiahua Ma, Yiran Qin, Yixiong Li, Xuanqi Liao, Yulan Guo, Ruimao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T11:31:44Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

### CannyEdit: Selective Canny Control and Dual-Prompt Guidance for   Training-Free Image Editing
**Authors**: Weiyan Xie, Han Gao, Didan Deng, Kaican Li, April Hua Liu, Yongxiang Huang, Nevin L. Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T11:06:58Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2) Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for competitor methods.

### Managing Data for Scalable and Interactive Event Sequence Visualization
**Authors**: Sayef Azad Sakin, Katherine E. Isaacs

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T02:33:21Z

**Summary**: Parallel event sequences, such as those collected in program execution traces and automated manufacturing pipelines, are typically visualized as interactive parallel timelines. As the dataset size grows, these charts frequently experience lag during common interactions such as zooming, panning, and filtering. Summarization approaches can improve interaction performance, but at the cost of accuracy in representation. To address this challenge, we introduce ESeMan (Event Sequence Manager), an event sequence management system designed to support interactive rendering of timeline visualizations with tunable accuracy. ESeMan employs hierarchical data structures and intelligent caching to provide visualizations with only the data necessary to generate accurate summarizations with significantly reduced data fetch time. We evaluate ESeMan's query times against summed area tables, M4 aggregation, and statistical sub-sampling on a variety of program execution traces. Our results demonstrate ESeMan provides better performance, achieving sub-100ms fetch times while maintaining visualization accuracy at the pixel level. We further present our benchmarking harness, enabling future performance evaluations for event sequence visualization.

### PAE MobiLLM: Privacy-Aware and Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning on the Mobile   Device via Additive Side-Tuning
**Authors**: Xingke Yang, Liang Li, Zhiyi Wan, Sicong Li, Xiaoqi Qi, Jiang Liu, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Xin Fu, Miao Pan

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T00:12:01Z

**Summary**: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data and labels to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops an activation shortcut that transmits only the token involved in the loss calculation instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data and labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PAE MobiLLM's superiority.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T18:16:33Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

### SlimInfer: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Dynamic Token   Pruning
**Authors**: Lingkun Long, Rubing Yang, Yushi Huang, Desheng Hui, Ao Zhou, Jianlei Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T16:42:38Z

**Summary**: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unstable Logs
**Authors**: Fatemeh Hadadi, Qinghua Xu, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T14:25:24Z

**Summary**: Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

### KV Cache Compression for Inference Efficiency in LLMs: A Review
**Authors**: Yanyu Liu, Jingying Fu, Sixiang Liu, Yitian Zou, You Fu, Jiehan Zhou, Shouhua Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T13:19:30Z

**Summary**: Withtherapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the context length for inference has been continuously increasing, leading to an exponential growth in the demand for Key-Value (KV) caching. This has resulted in a significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic strategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve inference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language models.

### Fewer Denoising Steps or Cheaper Per-Step Inference: Towards   Compute-Optimal Diffusion Model Deployment
**Authors**: Zhenbang Du, Yonggan Fu, Lifu Wang, Jiayi Qian, Xiao Luo, Yingyan, Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T09:29:37Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/PostDiff.

### LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths
**Authors**: Meixuan Wang, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T08:54:21Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

### A Generic Complete Anytime Beam Search for Optimal Decision Tree
**Authors**: Harold Silvère Kiossou, Siegfried Nijssen, Pierre Schaus

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T06:53:50Z

**Summary**: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior -- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching, combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

### Affine Springer fibers and depth zero L-packets
**Authors**: Roman Bezrukavnikov, Yakov Varshavsky

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T06:38:01Z

**Summary**: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet.   The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence.   As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.

### Diffusion LLMs Can Do Faster-Than-AR Inference via Discrete Diffusion   Forcing
**Authors**: Xu Wang, Chenkai Xu, Yijie Jin, Jiachun Jin, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T04:51:37Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference. D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable output quality. The code is available at https://github.com/zhijie-group/Discrete-Diffusion-Forcing.

### ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through   Dynamic Embedding Updates
**Authors**: Hamidreza Dastmalchi, Aijun An, Ali cheraghian

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T23:11:33Z

**Summary**: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning, training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However, current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy, setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

### RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute
**Authors**: J. Pablo Muñoz, Jinjie Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T21:18:52Z

**Summary**: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary. To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching, which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable, high-performance language model adaptation.

### VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information   Flow-Guided Optimization
**Authors**: Sihan Yang, Runsen Xu, Chenhang Cui, Tai Wang, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T09:47:21Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically, we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning, thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs. Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### PoseGen: In-Context LoRA Finetuning for Pose-Controllable Long Human   Video Generation
**Authors**: Jingxuan He, Busheng Su, Finn Wong

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T07:19:02Z

**Summary**: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models, which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.

### Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines
**Authors**: Ugur Cetintemel, Shu Chen, Alexander W. Lee, Deepti Raghavan

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T03:49:56Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.   In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.   SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Zhengming Zhang, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:57:39Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based   Dictionary Learning
**Authors**: Magauiya Zhussip, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:06:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

### From FASTER to F2: Evolving Concurrent Key-Value Store Designs for Large   Skewed Workloads
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellis, Badrish Chandramouli, Ted Hart, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:38:06Z

**Summary**: Modern large-scale services such as search engines, messaging platforms, and serverless functions, rely on key-value (KV) stores to maintain high performance at scale. When such services are deployed in constrained memory environments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have been widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from suboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a high-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable success in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked with serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high indexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of non-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.   In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER designed to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry applications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle larger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free mechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To realize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows that F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores, effectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as part of the FASTER project.

### CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:02:10Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.

### CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:46:11Z

**Summary**: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.

### KVSink: Understanding and Enhancing the Preservation of Attention Sinks   in KV Cache Quantization for LLMs
**Authors**: Zunhai Su, Kehong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:40:09Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce \textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

### EdgeInfinite-Instruct: Bridging SFT-Based Optimization and NPU-Level   Efficiency for Edge Devices

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T08:32:53Z

**Summary**: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

### Rhea: a Framework for Fast Design and Validation of RTL Cache-Coherent   Memory Subsystems
**Authors**: Davide Zoni, Andrea Galimberti, Adriano Guarisco

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T18:34:48Z

**Summary**: Designing and validating efficient cache-coherent memory subsystems is a critical yet complex task in the development of modern multi-core system-on-chip architectures. Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the design and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On the design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL supporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea integrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system simulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside the actual RTL under test. We apply Rhea to design MSI-based RTL memory subsystems with one and two levels of private caches and scaling up to sixteen cores. Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark suites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby's MI and MOESI models. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate simulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher fidelity by simulating real RTL hardware. This overhead decreases with scale, down to 1.6 times in sixteen-core scenarios. These results demonstrate Rhea's effectiveness and scalability in enabling fast development of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystem designs.

### FEB-Cache: Frequency-Guided Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing   Diffusion Transformer Caching
**Authors**: Zhen Zou, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T16:17:01Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration.

### Bidirectional TLS Handshake Caching for Constrained Industrial IoT   Scenarios
**Authors**: Jörn Bodenhausen, Simon Mangel, Thomas Vogt, Martin Henze

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T11:00:41Z

**Summary**: While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use to secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is severely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks. Most notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs significant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in constrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which realizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant parts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus, redundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding computations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By implementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth consumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by up to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving the strict security guarantees of TLS.

### SmartLLMs Scheduler: A Framework for Cost-Effective LLMs Utilization
**Authors**: Yueyue Liu, Hongyu Zhang, Yuantian Miao

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T09:35:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.

### Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   Confidence-Gated Taylor
**Authors**: Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Jiaxing Yan, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu, Zetao Zhang, Yu Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T02:13:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

### GainSight: A Unified Framework for Data Lifetime Profiling and   Heterogeneous Memory Composition
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Cheng Jiajun, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, Philip Levis, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T00:25:53Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive increasing memory requirements, domain-specific accelerators need higher-density on-chip memory beyond what current SRAM scaling trends can provide. Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived data in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To address this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to heterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM) devices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To facilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive, open-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime profiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal StRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends with an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture cycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns with StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and project performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design consideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic exploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and efficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads reveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic array scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for high-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions achieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform SRAM hierarchies.

### Sparse-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs with Dynamic Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Yuerong Song, Xiaoran Liu, Ruixiao Li, Zhigeng Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Qipeng Guo, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T16:14:03Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

### CompressKV: Semantic Retrieval Heads Know What Tokens are Not Important   Before Generation
**Authors**: Xiaolin Lin, Jingcun Wang, Olga Kondrateva, Yiyu Shi, Bing Li, Grace Li Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T13:26:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.   To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/CompressKV.git.

### OnPair: Short Strings Compression for Fast Random Access
**Authors**: Francesco Gargiulo, Rossano Venturini

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T10:51:20Z

**Summary**: We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16 achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving compression speed and memory usage.

### LeanK: Learnable K Cache Channel Pruning for Efficient Decoding
**Authors**: Yike Zhang, Zhiyuan He, Huiqiang Jiang, Chengruidong Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Jianyong Wang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T09:08:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LeanK.

### CaliDrop: KV Cache Compression with Calibration
**Authors**: Yi Su, Quantong Qiu, Yuechi Zhou, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Ping Li, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T08:19:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques, including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

### Bridging Cache-Friendliness and Concurrency: A Locality-Optimized   In-Memory B-Skiplist
**Authors**: Yicong Luo, Senhe Hao, Brian Wheatman, Prashant Pandey, Helen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T04:48:41Z

**Summary**: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores, such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential. In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128 threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations, including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between 3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between 0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads with inserts.

### Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized   F-RANs
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Kai Li, Kun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T02:47:35Z

**Summary**: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T02:17:56Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of context window sizes in Large Language Models~(LLMs) has enabled them to tackle increasingly complex tasks involving lengthy documents. However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase in memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the key-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less relevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when critical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \textsc{PoD}~(Proximal tokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that allocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens in a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our approach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at the beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for next-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly redundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \textsc{PoD} preserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it shares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both queries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single set of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without discarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training adaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing structure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and real-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{PoD} reduces KV cache memory usage by up to 35\% without compromising performance. Our method is orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined with them for further KV cache compression.

### Revenue Optimization in Wireless Video Caching Networks: A   Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution
**Authors**: Yijing Zhang, Md-Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T19:16:40Z

**Summary**: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based optimization approaches.

### StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Haolin Yang, Feilong Tang, Linxiao Zhao, Xiang An, Ming Hu, Huifa Li, Xinlin Zhuang, Boqian Wang, Yifan Lu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Abdalla Swikir, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T18:15:42Z

**Summary**: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

### MCTS-SQL: Light-Weight LLMs can Master the Text-to-SQL through Monte   Carlo Tree Search
**Authors**: Shuozhi Yuan, Limin Chen, Miaomiao Yuan, Jin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T10:27:19Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP area, aiming at translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.

### SmallKV: Small Model Assisted Compensation of KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yi Zhao, Yajuan Peng, Cam-Tu Nguyen, Zuchao Li, Xiaoliang Wang, Hai Zhao, Xiaoming Fu

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T09:15:36Z

**Summary**: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

### GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D   Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: David Bauer, Qi Wu, Hamid Gadirov, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T23:59:11Z

**Summary**: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

### PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised   Transposition-equivariant Objective
**Authors**: Alain Riou, Bernardo Torres, Ben Hayes, Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres, Gaël Richard, Geoffroy Peeters

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T21:00:55Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

### Improving performance of content-centric networks via decentralized   coded caching for multi-level popularity and access
**Authors**: Azadeh Sadat Miraftab, Ahmadreza Montazerolghaem, Behrad Mahboobi

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T10:12:45Z

**Summary**: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching (DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN implementations.

### Unifying Mixture of Experts and Multi-Head Latent Attention for   Efficient Language Models
**Authors**: Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T08:33:30Z

**Summary**: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with 64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6 of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss optimization.   Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10), creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

### MoDM: Efficient Serving for Image Generation via Mixture-of-Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Yuchen Xia, Divyam Sharma, Yichao Yuan, Souvik Kundu, Nishil Talati

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T06:50:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trade latency for quality: small models are fast but generate lower-quality images, while large models produce better images but are slow.   We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families.   This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.   We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.

### Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xinyu Chen, Haotian Zhai, Can Zhang, Xiupeng Shi, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T06:43:43Z

**Summary**: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

### PiKV: KV Cache Management System for Mixture of Experts
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu, Xuhong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T03:50:14Z

**Summary**: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant overhead.   We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving framework tailored for MoE architecture.

### HIT Model: A Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower Model for   Pre-Ranking Systems
**Authors**: Haoqiang Yang, Congde Yuan, Kun Bai, Mengzhuo Guo, Wei Yang, Chao Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T00:31:18Z

**Summary**: Online display advertising platforms rely on pre-ranking systems to efficiently filter and prioritize candidate ads from large corpora, balancing relevance to users with strict computational constraints. The prevailing two-tower architecture, though highly efficient due to its decoupled design and pre-caching, suffers from cross-domain interaction and coarse similarity metrics, undermining its capacity to model complex user-ad relationships. In this study, we propose the Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower (HIT) model, a new architecture that augments the two-tower paradigm with two key components: $\textit{generators}$ that pre-generate holistic vectors incorporating coarse-grained user-ad interactions through a dual-generator framework with a cosine-similarity-based generation loss as the training objective, and $\textit{multi-head representers}$ that project embeddings into multiple latent subspaces to capture fine-grained, multi-faceted user interests and multi-dimensional ad attributes. This design enhances modeling effectiveness without compromising inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platform demonstrate that HIT significantly outperforms several baselines in relevance metrics, yielding a $1.66\%$ increase in Gross Merchandise Volume and a $1.55\%$ improvement in Return on Investment, alongside similar serving latency to the vanilla two-tower models. The HIT model has been successfully deployed in Tencent's online display advertising system, serving billions of impressions daily. The code is available at https://github.com/HarveyYang123/HIT_model.

### QPP-RNG: A Conceptual Quantum System for True Randomness
**Authors**: Randy Kuang

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T20:08:52Z

**Summary**: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint: algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$ -- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling -- dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8 bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T14:05:44Z

**Summary**: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.

### Energy-Aware CPU Orchestration in O-RAN: A dApp-Driven Lightweight   Approach
**Authors**: Francisco Crespo, Javier Villegas, Carlos Baena, Eduardo Baena, Sergio Fortes, Raquel Barco

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:40:52Z

**Summary**: The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through disaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this shift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under strict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between latency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS) schedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy consumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed application (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically orchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging thread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and cache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency scaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to proprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications. Fully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN stack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving energy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a commercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without compromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of low-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks

### Joint Association and Phase Shifts Design for UAV-mounted Stacked   Intelligent Metasurfaces-assisted Communications
**Authors**: Mingzhe Fan, Geng Sun, Hongyang Pan, Jiacheng Wang, Jiancheng An, Hongyang Du, Chau Yuen

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, while the fixed SIMs will limit the communication performance of the system compared to the mobile SIMs. In this work, we consider a UAV-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system, where UAVs as base stations (BSs) can cache the data processed by SIMs, and also as mobile vehicles flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance the communication performance. To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of UAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization problems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed to a convex form and then solved by the CVX tool, while we employ a layer-by-layer iterative optimization method for USPSOP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different simulation setups.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### Is ChatGPT-5 Ready for Mammogram VQA?
**Authors**: Qiang Li, Shansong Wang, Mingzhe Hu, Mojtaba Safari, Zachary Eidex, Xiaofeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:56:24Z

**Summary**: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening. We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment, abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%), calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0% malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with mammography VQA tasks.

### LoRAtorio: An intrinsic approach to LoRA Skill Composition
**Authors**: Niki Foteinopoulou, Ignas Budvytis, Stephan Liwicki

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:52:56Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario, which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

### Deconfounding via Profiled Transfer Learning
**Authors**: Ziyuan Chen, Yifan Jiang, Jingyuan Liu, Fang Yao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:48:36Z

**Summary**: Unmeasured confounders are a major source of bias in regression-based effect estimation and causal inference. In this paper, we advocate a new profiled transfer learning framework, ProTrans, to address confounding effects in the target dataset, when additional source datasets that possess similar confounding structures are available. We introduce the concept of profiled residuals to characterize the shared confounding patterns between source and target datasets. By incorporating these profiled residuals into the target debiasing step, we effectively mitigates the latent confounding effects. We also propose a source selection strategy to enhance robustness of ProTrans against noninformative sources. As a byproduct, ProTrans can also be utilized to estimate treatment effects when potential confounders exist, without the use of auxiliary features such as instrumental or proxy variables, which are often challenging to select in practice. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting estimated model shift from sources to target is confounding-free without any assumptions imposed on the true confounding structure, and that the target parameter estimation achieves the minimax optimal rate under mild conditions. Simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ProTrans and support the theoretical findings.

### Controlling Multimodal LLMs via Reward-guided Decoding
**Authors**: Oscar Mañas, Pierluca D'Oro, Koustuv Sinha, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Aishwarya Agrawal

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:29:06Z

**Summary**: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.

### Bulk viscous cosmological models with cosmological constant:   Observational constraints
**Authors**: R. Noemí Villalobos, Yerko Vásquez, Norman Cruz, Carlos H. López-Caraballo

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:24:36Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether viscous cold dark matter (vCDM) in a $\Lambda$-dominated FLRW universe can alleviate the Hubble tension while satisfying thermodynamic constraints, examining both flat and curved geometries. We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\zeta = \zeta_0\,(\Omega_{vc}/\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity evolution and $\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two particular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$ free). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest datasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and without it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and a Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as AIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble tension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\sim 1\sigma$ tension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included. For the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 = 71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\Omega_{K0} > 0$ (at more than $2\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once the PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained to $\zeta_0 \sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the thermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian evidence favors $\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models in some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither resolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve more robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations, which are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_0$.

### A Dual-Perspective NLG Meta-Evaluation Framework with Automatic   Benchmark and Better Interpretability
**Authors**: Xinyu Hu, Mingqi Gao, Li Lin, Zhenghan Yu, Xiaojun Wan

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:10:35Z

**Summary**: In NLG meta-evaluation, evaluation metrics are typically assessed based on their consistency with humans. However, we identify some limitations in traditional NLG meta-evaluation approaches, such as issues in handling human ratings and ambiguous selections of correlation measures, which undermine the effectiveness of meta-evaluation. In this work, we propose a dual-perspective NLG meta-evaluation framework that focuses on different evaluation capabilities, thereby providing better interpretability. In addition, we introduce a method of automatically constructing the corresponding benchmarks without requiring new human annotations. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with 16 representative LLMs as the evaluators based on our proposed framework, comprehensively analyzing their evaluation performance from different perspectives.

### CryptoScope: Utilizing Large Language Models for Automated Cryptographic   Logic Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Zhihao Li, Zimo Ji, Tao Zheng, Hao Ren, Xiao Lan

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:07:54Z

**Summary**: Cryptographic algorithms are fundamental to modern security, yet their implementations frequently harbor subtle logic flaws that are hard to detect. We introduce CryptoScope, a novel framework for automated cryptographic vulnerability detection powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). CryptoScope combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), guided by a curated cryptographic knowledge base containing over 12,000 entries. We evaluate CryptoScope on LLM-CLVA, a benchmark of 92 cases primarily derived from real-world CVE vulnerabilities, complemented by cryptographic challenges from major Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and synthetic examples across 11 programming languages. CryptoScope consistently improves performance over strong LLM baselines, boosting DeepSeek-V3 by 11.62%, GPT-4o-mini by 20.28%, and GLM-4-Flash by 28.69%. Additionally, it identifies 9 previously undisclosed flaws in widely used open-source cryptographic projects.

### Pr$εε$mpt: Sanitizing Sensitive Prompts for LLMs
**Authors**: Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, Mihir Bellare

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:46:42Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

### Visual Perception Engine: Fast and Flexible Multi-Head Inference for   Robotic Vision Tasks
**Authors**: Jakub Łucki, Jonathan Becktor, Georgios Georgakis, Robert Royce, Shehryar Khattak

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:42:23Z

**Summary**: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.

### Aware First, Think Less: Dynamic Boundary Self-Awareness Drives Extreme   Reasoning Efficiency in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Dengyun Peng, Jinhao Liu, HuiKang Su, Jiannan Guan, Libo Qin, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:40:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism. These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16% accuracy improvement.

### Testing a New Star Formation History Model from Principal Component   Analysis to Facilitate Spectral Synthesis Modeling
**Authors**: Yanzhe Zhang, H. J. Mo, Katherine E. Whitaker, Shuang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:33:32Z

**Summary**: The spectrum of a galaxy is a complicated convolution of many properties of the galaxy, such as the star formation history (SFH), initial mass function, and metallicity. Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via spectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet flexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this paper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH models in terms of their capability of describing the simulated SFHs and the spectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models ($\Gamma$, $\tau$, and nonparametric), we also examine a model developed from principal component analysis (PCA), trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG. We find that when using the first five principal components (eigenhistories), the PCA-based models can achieve a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Among the models tested, the PCA-based model provides high flexibility, by capturing diverse and complex simulated SFHs. To accurately reproduce spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a degree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function covering the age of 0 - 0.3 Gyr). Overall, the PCA+step model performs well in capturing the diversity of SFHs and reproducing the associated spectra, suggesting it is a promising and reliable approach for spectral synthesis modeling.

### Activate Me!: Designing Efficient Activation Functions for   Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption
**Authors**: Nges Brian Njungle, Michel A. Kinsy

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:31:12Z

**Summary**: The growing adoption of machine learning in sensitive areas such as healthcare and defense introduces significant privacy and security challenges. These domains demand robust data protection, as models depend on large volumes of sensitive information for both training and inference. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations directly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire machine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear operations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions, essential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based machine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square function and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20 architectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we assess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a novel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE constraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in shallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per image. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The polynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image, while our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a longer inference time of 1,697 seconds. These results underscore a critical trade-off in FHE-based ML: faster activation functions often reduce accuracy, whereas those preserving accuracy demand greater computational resources.

### Why Report Failed Interactions With Robots?! Towards Vignette-based   Interaction Quality
**Authors**: Agnes Axelsson, Merle Reimann, Ronald Cumbal, Hannah Pelikan, Divesh Lala

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:07:03Z

**Summary**: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing interaction evaluation methods.

**Authors**: Zhenhua Xu, Xubin Yue, Zhebo Wang, Qichen Liu, Xixiang Zhao, Jingxuan Zhang, Wenjun Zeng, Wengpeng Xing, Dezhang Kong, Changting Lin, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:50:20Z

**Summary**: Copyright protection for large language models is of critical importance, given their substantial development costs, proprietary value, and potential for misuse. Existing surveys have predominantly focused on techniques for tracing LLM-generated content-namely, text watermarking-while a systematic exploration of methods for protecting the models themselves (i.e., model watermarking and model fingerprinting) remains absent. Moreover, the relationships and distinctions among text watermarking, model watermarking, and model fingerprinting have not been comprehensively clarified. This work presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of LLM copyright protection technologies, with a focus on model fingerprinting, covering the following aspects: (1) clarifying the conceptual connection from text watermarking to model watermarking and fingerprinting, and adopting a unified terminology that incorporates model watermarking into the broader fingerprinting framework; (2) providing an overview and comparison of diverse text watermarking techniques, highlighting cases where such methods can function as model fingerprinting; (3) systematically categorizing and comparing existing model fingerprinting approaches for LLM copyright protection; (4) presenting, for the first time, techniques for fingerprint transfer and fingerprint removal; (5) summarizing evaluation metrics for model fingerprints, including effectiveness, harmlessness, robustness, stealthiness, and reliability; and (6) discussing open challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer researchers a thorough understanding of both text watermarking and model fingerprinting technologies in the era of LLMs, thereby fostering further advances in protecting their intellectual property.

### Omni-DPO: A Dual-Perspective Paradigm for Dynamic Preference Learning of   LLMs
**Authors**: Shangpin Peng, Weinong Wang, Zhuotao Tian, Senqiao Yang, Xing Wu, Haotian Xu, Chengquan Zhang, Takashi Isobe, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:40:50Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

### Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of   Reduced-order Models
**Authors**: Nicole Aretz, Karen Willcox

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:38:52Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

### Reinforcing Video Reasoning Segmentation to Think Before It Segments
**Authors**: Sitong Gong, Lu Zhang, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:34:56Z

**Summary**: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models (LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction. However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding, yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS), while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model weights will be available at Veason-R1.

### Language models align with brain regions that represent concepts across   modalities
**Authors**: Maria Ryskina, Greta Tuckute, Alexander Fung, Ashley Malkin, Evelina Fedorenko

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:32:19Z

**Summary**: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences, targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image) using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

### Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529
**Authors**: Ivan Markin, Anna Puecher, Mattia Bulla, Tim Dietrich

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:26:46Z

**Summary**: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.

### Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Monika Jotautaitė, Lucius Caviola, David A. Brewster, Thilo Hagendorff

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:22:00Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias -- discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1) SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals. These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes in AI systems and the societies they influence.

### Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners, or, Four   Habits of Highly Effective STaRs
**Authors**: Kanishk Gandhi, Ayush Chakravarthy, Anikait Singh, Nathan Lile, Noah D. Goodman

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:21:46Z

**Summary**: Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.

### Inspire or Predict? Exploring New Paradigms in Assisting Classical   Planners with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wenkai Yu, Jianhang Tang, Yang Zhang, Shanjiang Tang, Kebing Jin, Hankz Hankui Zhuo

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:08:07Z

**Summary**: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge within LLMs.

### Variational Autoencoders for At-Source Data Reduction and Anomaly   Detection in High Energy Particle Detectors
**Authors**: Alexander Yue, Haoyi Jia, Julia Gonski

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:24:05Z

**Summary**: Detectors in next-generation high-energy physics experiments face several daunting requirements, such as high data rates, damaging radiation exposure, and stringent constraints on power, space, and latency. To address these challenges, machine learning in readout electronics can be leveraged for smart detector designs, enabling intelligent inference and data reduction at-source. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer a variety of benefits for front-end readout; an on-sensor encoder can perform efficient lossy data compression while simultaneously providing a latent space representation that can be used for anomaly detection. Results are presented from low-latency and resource-efficient VAEs for front-end data processing in a futuristic silicon pixel detector. Encoder-based data compression is found to preserve good performance of off-detector analysis while significantly reducing the off-detector data rate as compared to a similarly sized data filtering approach. Furthermore, the latent space information is found to be a useful discriminator in the context of real-time sensor defect monitoring. Together, these results highlight the multifaceted utility of autoencoder-based front-end readout schemes and motivate their consideration in future detector designs.

### From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility   Systems
**Authors**: Jiangbo Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:21:57Z

**Summary**: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are viewed as vehicular systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing pre-programmed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 0 to 5); Examples of this outpace include the interaction with humans with natural language, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and unseen ethical dilemma handling, largely empowered by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this gap, this paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper proposes the term AgVs and their distinguishing characteristics from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in integrating LLMs and AuVs and highlights how AgVs might transform future mobility systems and ensure the systems are human-centered. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, and how they can play a significant role in future agentic transportation systems.

### MetaAgents: Large Language Model Based Agents for Decision-Making on   Teaming
**Authors**: Yuan Li, Lichao Sun, Yixuan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:18:48Z

**Summary**: Significant advancements have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulations. Despite this, their abilities to perform teaming in task-oriented social events are underexplored. Such capabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social behaviors and form efficient teams to solve tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaAgents, a social simulation framework populated with LLM-based agents. MetaAgents facilitates agent engagement in conversations and a series of decision making within social contexts, serving as an appropriate platform for investigating interactions and interpersonal decision-making of agents. In particular, we construct a job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize the team assembly and skill-matching behaviors of LLM-based agents. We take advantage of both quantitative metrics evaluation and qualitative text analysis to assess their teaming abilities at the job fair. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-based agents perform competently in making rational decisions to develop efficient teams. However, we also identify limitations that hinder their effectiveness in more complex team assembly tasks. Our work provides valuable insights into the role and evolution of LLMs in task-oriented social simulations.

**Authors**: Xiaoxue Gao, Huayun Zhang, Nancy F. Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:15:19Z

**Summary**: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.

### OVSegDT: Segmenting Transformer for Open-Vocabulary Object Goal   Navigation
**Authors**: Tatiana Zemskova, Aleksei Staroverov, Dmitry Yudin, Aleksandr Panov

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:48:15Z

**Summary**: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.

### DSperse: A Framework for Targeted Verification in Zero-Knowledge Machine   Learning
**Authors**: Dan Ivanov, Tristan Freiberg, Shirin Shahabi, Jonathan Gold, Haruna Isah

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:42:28Z

**Summary**: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.

### CoFi: A Fast Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot Pipeline for Glomerular Basement   Membrane Segmentation
**Authors**: Hongjin Fang, Daniel Reisenbüchler, Kenji Ikemura, Mert R. Sabuncu, Yihe Yang, Ruining Deng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:34:24Z

**Summary**: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning, which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CoFi.

### TRACY: Benchmarking Execution Efficiency of LLM-Based Code Translation
**Authors**: Zhihao Gong, Zeyu Sun, Dong Huang, Qingyuan Liang, Jie M. Zhang, Dan Hao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:33:52Z

**Summary**: Automatic code translation is a fundamental task in modern software development. While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the correctness of code translation, the critical dimension of execution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce TRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven two-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to amplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task pruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting benchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python, each accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10 computationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative LLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient code translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for correctness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account, surpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that algorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental, causing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\times$ and memory increase of 12.0$\times$, respectively. Our work underscores the necessity of jointly optimizing for correctness and efficiency in future LLM-based code translation.

### Calibrated and uncertain? Evaluating uncertainty estimates in binary   classification models
**Authors**: Aurora Grefsrud, Nello Blaser, Trygve Buanes

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:17:32Z

**Summary**: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery, especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study, we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss, (iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:10:24Z

**Summary**: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

### Reference Points in LLM Sentiment Analysis: The Role of Structured   Context
**Authors**: Junichiro Niimi

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields, including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

### Inclusion Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating Large Foundation Models   with Real-World Apps
**Authors**: Kangyu Wang, Hongliang He, Lin Liu, Ruiqi Liang, Zhenzhong Lan, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:00:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is publicly accessible at https://doraemon.alipay.com/model-ranking.

### Simulation-based inference using splitting schemes for partially   observed diffusions in chemical reaction networks
**Authors**: Petar Jovanovski, Andrew Golightly, Umberto Picchini, Massimiliano Tamborrino

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:38:48Z

**Summary**: We address the problem of simulation and parameter inference for chemical reaction networks described by the chemical Langevin equation, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation of the dynamics of the chemical species. This is challenging for two main reasons. First, the (multi-dimensional) SDEs cannot be explicitly solved and are driven by multiplicative and non-commutative noise, requiring the development of advanced numerical schemes for their approximation and simulation. Second, not all components of the SDEs are directly observed, as the available discrete-time data are typically incomplete and/or perturbed with measurement error. We tackle these issues via three contributions. First, we show that these models can be rewritten as perturbed conditionally Cox-Ingersoll-Ross-type SDEs, i.e., each coordinate, conditioned on all other coordinates being fixed, follows an SDE with linear drift and square root diffusion coefficient perturbed by additional Brownian motions. Second, for this class of SDEs, we develop a numerical splitting scheme that preserves structural properties of the model, such as oscillations, state space and invariant distributions, unlike the commonly used Euler-Maruyama scheme. Our numerical method is robust for large integration time steps. Third, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm incorporating "data-conditional" simulation and sequential learning of summary statistics, allowing inference for multidimensional partially observed systems, further developing previous results on fully observed systems based on the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We validate our approach on models of interest in chemical reaction networks, such as the stochastic Repressilator, Lotka-Volterra, and two-pool systems, demonstrating its effectiveness, in terms of both numerical and inferential accuracy, and reduced computational cost.

### Vecchia Gaussian Processes: Probabilistic Properties, Minimax Rates and   Methodological Developments
**Authors**: Botond Szabo, Yichen Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:25:21Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used to model dependencies in spatial statistics and machine learning; however, exact inference is computationally intractable, with a time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Vecchia approximation allows scalable Bayesian inference of GPs by introducing sparsity in the spatial dependency structure characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Despite its practical popularity, the approach lacks rigorous theoretical foundations, and the choice of DAG structure remains an open question. In this paper, we systematically study Vecchia GPs as standalone stochastic processes, uncovering key probabilistic and statistical properties. For probabilistic properties, we prove that the conditional distributions of the Mat\'{e}rn GPs, as well as their Vecchia approximations, can be characterized by polynomial interpolations. This allows us to prove a series of results regarding small ball probabilities and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) of Vecchia GPs. For the statistical methodology, we provide a principled guideline for selecting parent sets as norming sets with fixed cardinality, and we develop algorithms along these guidelines. In terms of theoretical guarantees, we establish posterior contraction rates for Vecchia GPs in the nonparametric regression model and show that minimax-optimal rates are attained under oracle rescaling or hierarchical Bayesian tuning. We demonstrate our theoretical results and methodology through numerical studies and provide an efficient implementation of our methods in C++, with interfaces in R.

### Online Anti-sexist Speech: Identifying Resistance to Gender Bias in   Political Discourse
**Authors**: Aditi Dutta, Susan Banducci

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:24:22Z

**Summary**: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist, anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year 2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices. We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital political spaces.

### Relationship Detection on Tabular Data Using Statistical Analysis and   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Panagiotis Koletsis, Christos Panagiotopoulos, Georgios Th. Papadopoulos, Vasilis Efthymiou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:22:31Z

**Summary**: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

### FAB-PPI: Frequentist, Assisted by Bayes, Prediction-Powered Inference
**Authors**: Stefano Cortinovis, François Caron

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:20:22Z

**Summary**: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) enables valid statistical inference by combining experimental data with machine learning predictions. When a sufficient number of high-quality predictions is available, PPI results in more accurate estimates and tighter confidence intervals than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose to inform the PPI framework with prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions. The resulting method, which we call frequentist, assisted by Bayes, PPI (FAB-PPI), improves over PPI when the observed prediction quality is likely under the prior, while maintaining its frequentist guarantees. Furthermore, when using heavy-tailed priors, FAB-PPI adaptively reverts to standard PPI in low prior probability regions. We demonstrate the benefits of FAB-PPI in real and synthetic examples.

### Remove360: Benchmarking Residuals After Object Removal in 3D Gaussian   Splatting
**Authors**: Simona Kocour, Assia Benbihi, Torsten Sattler

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:15:06Z

**Summary**: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at huggingface.co/datasets/simkoc/Remove360.

### Exploring Superior Function Calls via Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Bingguang Hao, Maolin Wang, Zengzhuang Xu, Yicheng Chen, Cunyin Peng, Jinjie GU, Chenyi Zhuang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:14:24Z

**Summary**: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.

### GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet   Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Qiwei Zhu, Kai Li, Guojing Zhang, Xiaoying Wang, Jianqiang Huang, Xilai Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:13:58Z

**Summary**: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain constraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution frequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster.

### EllieSQL: Cost-Efficient Text-to-SQL with Complexity-Aware Routing
**Authors**: Yizhang Zhu, Runzhi Jiang, Boyan Li, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:08:35Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL automatically translates natural language queries to SQL, allowing non-technical users to retrieve data from databases without specialized SQL knowledge. Despite the success of advanced LLM-based Text-to-SQL approaches on leaderboards, their unsustainable computational costs--often overlooked--stand as the "elephant in the room" in current leaderboard-driven research, limiting their economic practicability for real-world deployment and widespread adoption. To tackle this, we exploratively propose EllieSQL, a complexity-aware routing framework that assigns queries to suitable SQL generation pipelines based on estimated complexity. We investigate multiple routers to direct simple queries to efficient approaches while reserving computationally intensive methods for complex cases. Drawing from economics, we introduce the Token Elasticity of Performance (TEP) metric, capturing cost-efficiency by quantifying the responsiveness of performance gains relative to token investment in SQL generation. Experiments show that compared to always using the most advanced methods in our study, EllieSQL with the Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO router reduces token use by over 40% without compromising performance on Bird development set, achieving more than a 2x boost in TEP over non-routing approaches. This not only advances the pursuit of cost-efficient Text-to-SQL but also invites the community to weigh resource efficiency alongside performance, contributing to progress in sustainable Text-to-SQL. Our source code and model are available at https://elliesql.github.io/.

### HumorPlanSearch: Structured Planning and HuCoT for Contextual AI Humor
**Authors**: Shivam Dubey

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:07:56Z

**Summary**: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score (HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates, and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13 human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent (p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

### Tapas are free! Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via   LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments
**Authors**: Jinwei Hu, Yi Dong, Youcheng Sun, Xiaowei Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:02:46Z

**Summary**: Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.

### Feather-SQL: A Lightweight NL2SQL Framework with Dual-Model   Collaboration Paradigm for Small Language Models
**Authors**: Wenqi Pei, Hailing Xu, Hengyuan Zhao, Shizheng Hou, Han Chen, Zining Zhang, Pingyi Luo, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:48:28Z

**Summary**: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) has seen significant advancements with large language models (LLMs). However, these models often depend on closed-source systems and high computational resources, posing challenges in data privacy and deployment. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) struggle with NL2SQL tasks, exhibiting poor performance and incompatibility with existing frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce Feather-SQL, a new lightweight framework tailored for SLMs. Feather-SQL improves SQL executability and accuracy through 1) schema pruning and linking, 2) multi-path and multi-candidate generation. Additionally, we introduce the 1+1 Model Collaboration Paradigm, which pairs a strong general-purpose chat model with a fine-tuned SQL specialist, combining strong analytical reasoning with high-precision SQL generation. Experimental results on BIRD demonstrate that Feather-SQL improves NL2SQL performance on SLMs, with around 10% boost for models without fine-tuning. The proposed paradigm raises the accuracy ceiling of SLMs to 54.76%, highlighting its effectiveness.

### AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF
**Authors**: Yusheng Zheng, Yanpeng Hu, Tong Yu, Andi Quinn

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:45:40Z

**Summary**: Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.

### AIM-Bench: Evaluating Decision-making Biases of Agentic LLM as Inventory   Manager
**Authors**: Xuhua Zhao, Yuxuan Xie, Caihua Chen, Yuxiang Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:38:19Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support systems for supply chains.

### Survey-to-Behavior: Downstream Alignment of Human Values in LLMs via   Survey Questions
**Authors**: Shangrui Nie, Florian Mai, David Kaczér, Charles Welch, Zhixue Zhao, Lucie Flek

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:36:17Z

**Summary**: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in implicit downstream task behavior.

### Towards Embodied Conversational Agents for Reducing Oral Exam Anxiety in   Extended Reality
**Authors**: Jens Grubert, Yvonne Sedelmaier, Dieter Landes

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:33:03Z

**Summary**: Oral examinations are a prevalent but psychologically demanding form of assessment in higher education. Many students experience intense anxiety, which can impair cognitive performance and hinder academic success. This position paper explores the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in extended reality (XR) environments to support students preparing for oral exams. We propose a system concept that integrates photorealistic ECAs with real-time capable large language models (LLMs) to enable psychologically safe, adaptive, and repeatable rehearsal of oral examination scenarios. We also discuss the potential benefits and challenges of such an envisioned system.

### RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator
**Authors**: Zhiming Liu, Nantheera Anantrasirichai

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:20:18Z

**Summary**: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric turbulence suppression tasks.

### On-Policy RL Meets Off-Policy Experts: Harmonizing Supervised   Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting
**Authors**: Wenhao Zhang, Yuexiang Xie, Yuchang Sun, Yanxi Chen, Guoyin Wang, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:20:03Z

**Summary**: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines. We release the implementation at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to inspire further research.

**Summary**: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.

### Trustworthy AI Psychotherapy: Multi-Agent LLM Workflow for Counseling   and Explainable Mental Disorder Diagnosis
**Authors**: Mithat Can Ozgun, Jiahuan Pei, Koen Hindriks, Lucia Donatelli, Qingzhi Liu, Xin Sun, Junxiao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:08:32Z

**Summary**: LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

### Synthesizing Evidence: Data-Pooling as a Tool for Treatment Selection in   Online Experiments
**Authors**: Zhenkang Peng, Chengzhang Li, Ying Rong, Renyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:01:26Z

**Summary**: Randomized experiments are the gold standard for causal inference but face significant challenges in business applications, including limited traffic allocation, the need for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and the complexity of managing overlapping experiments. These factors lead to high variability in treatment effect estimates, making data-driven policy roll out difficult. To address these issues, we introduce the data pooling treatment roll-out (DPTR) framework, which enhances policy roll-out by pooling data across experiments rather than focusing narrowly on individual ones. DPTR can effectively accommodate both overlapping and non-overlapping traffic scenarios, regardless of linear or nonlinear model specifications. We demonstrate the framework's robustness through a three-pronged validation: (a) theoretical analysis shows that DPTR surpasses the traditional difference-in-mean and ordinary least squares methods under non-overlapping experiments, particularly when the number of experiments is large; (b) synthetic simulations confirm its adaptability in complex scenarios with overlapping traffic, rich covariates and nonlinear specifications; and (c) empirical applications to two experimental datasets from real world platforms, demonstrating its effectiveness in guiding customized policy roll-outs for subgroups within a single experiment, as well as in coordinating policy deployments across multiple experiments with overlapping scenarios. By reducing estimation variability to improve decision-making effectiveness, DPTR provides a scalable, practical solution for online platforms to better leverage their experimental data in today's increasingly complex business environments.

### LKFMixer: Exploring Large Kernel Feature For Efficient Image   Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Yinggan Tang, Quanwei Hu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:50:38Z

**Summary**: The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance of non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing power required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models. To solve this problem, we propose a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) model, LKFMixer, which utilizes large convolutional kernel to simulate the ability of self-attention to capture non-local features. Specifically, we increase the kernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce the parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a spatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of feature information on both spatial and channel dimension. In addition, by introducing feature selection block (FSB), the model can adaptively adjust the weights between local features and non-local features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LKFMixer family outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of SR performance and reconstruction quality. In particular, compared with SwinIR-light on Manga109 dataset, LKFMixer-L achieves 0.6dB PSNR improvement at $\times$4 scale, while the inference speed is $\times$5 times faster. The code is available at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKFMixer.

### The Roots of International Perceptions: Simulating US Attitude Changes   Towards China with LLM Agents
**Authors**: Nicholas Sukiennik, Yichuan Xu, Yuqing Kan, Jinghua Piao, Yuwei Yan, Chen Gao, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:48:46Z

**Summary**: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.

### Model-Independent Test of Prerecombination New Physics: Measuring the   Sound Horizon with Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens and the Baryon Acoustic   Oscillation Angular Scale
**Authors**: William Giarè, Jonathan Betts, Carsten van de Bruck, Eleonora Di Valentino

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:40:56Z

**Summary**: In a broad class of cosmological models where spacetime is described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, photons propagate along null geodesics, and their number is conserved, upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) observations can be combined with measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) angular scale to provide model-independent estimates of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. By focusing on the accuracy expected from forthcoming surveys such as LISA GW standard sirens and DESI or Euclid angular BAO measurements, we forecast a relative precision of $\sigma_{r_{\rm d}} /r_{\rm d} \sim 1.5\%$ within the redshift range $z \lesssim 1$. This approach will offer a unique model-independent measure of a fundamental scale characterizing the early universe, which is competitive with model-dependent values inferred within specific theoretical frameworks. These measurements can serve as a consistency test for $\Lambda$CDM, potentially clarifying the nature of the Hubble tension and confirming or ruling out new physics prior to recombination with a statistical significance of $\sim 4\sigma$.

### AirTrafficGen: Configurable Air Traffic Scenario Generation with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Dewi Sid William Gould, George De Ath, Ben Carvell, Nick Pepper

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:37:36Z

**Summary**: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, $\texttt{AirTrafficGen}$, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.

**Authors**: Mikhail Seleznyov, Mikhail Chaichuk, Gleb Ershov, Alexander Panchenko, Elena Tutubalina, Oleg Somov

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:32:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to subtle, non-semantic variations in prompt phrasing and formatting. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of 5 methods for improving prompt robustness within a unified experimental framework. We benchmark these techniques on 8 models from Llama, Qwen and Gemma families across 52 tasks from Natural Instructions dataset. Our evaluation covers robustness methods from both fine-tuned and in-context learning paradigms, and tests their generalization against multiple types of distribution shifts. Finally, we extend our analysis to GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 to assess frontier models' current robustness to format perturbations. Our findings offer actionable insights into the relative effectiveness of these robustness methods, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions when aiming for stable and reliable LLM performance in real-world applications.

**Authors**: Ramil Khafizov, Artem Komarichev, Ruslan Rakhimov, Peter Wonka, Evgeny Burnaev

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:25:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information. Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution. This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including 3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input modalities.

### Feedback Indicators: The Alignment between Llama and a Teacher in   Language Learning
**Authors**: Sylvio Rüdian, Yassin Elsir, Marvin Kretschmer, Sabine Cayrou, Niels Pinkwart

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:59:22Z

**Summary**: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable and transparent formative feedback in future research.

### Can We Tell if ChatGPT is a Parasite? Studying Human-AI Symbiosis with   Game Theory
**Authors**: Jiejun Hu-Bolz, James Stovold

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:54:13Z

**Summary**: This work asks whether a human interacting with a generative AI system can merge into a single individual through iterative, information-driven interactions. We model the interactions between a human, a generative AI system, and the human's wider environment as a three-player stochastic game. We use information-theoretic measures (entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy) to show that our modelled human and generative AI are able to form an aggregate individual in the sense of Krakauer et al. (2020). The model we present is able to answer interesting questions around the symbiotic nature of humans and AI systems, including whether LLM-driven chatbots are acting as parasites, feeding on the information provided by humans.

### ETTRL: Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Test-Time   Reinforcement Learning Via Entropy Mechanism
**Authors**: Jia Liu, ChangYi He, YingQiao Lin, MingMin Yang, FeiYang Shen, ShaoGuo Liu, TingTing Gao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:49:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

### Visual-RAG: Benchmarking Text-to-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation   for Visual Knowledge Intensive Queries
**Authors**: Yin Wu, Quanyu Long, Jing Li, Jianfei Yu, Wenya Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:45:15Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a paradigm that augments large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge to tackle knowledge-intensive question answering. While several benchmarks evaluate Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) under Multimodal RAG settings, they predominantly retrieve from textual corpora and do not explicitly assess how models exploit visual evidence during generation. Consequently, there still lacks benchmark that isolates and measures the contribution of retrieved images in RAG. We introduce Visual-RAG, a question-answering benchmark that targets visually grounded, knowledge-intensive questions. Unlike prior work, Visual-RAG requires text-to-image retrieval and the integration of retrieved clue images to extract visual evidence for answer generation. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-source and 3 proprietary MLLMs, showcasing that images provide strong evidence in augmented generation. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle to efficiently extract and utilize visual knowledge. Our results highlight the need for improved visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution in multimodal RAG systems.

### RULEBREAKERS: Challenging LLMs at the Crossroads between Formal Logic   and Human-like Reasoning
**Authors**: Jason Chan, Robert Gaizauskas, Zhixue Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:41:39Z

**Summary**: Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

### NeMo: A Neuron-Level Modularizing-While-Training Approach for   Decomposing DNN Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Bi, Binhang Qi, Hailong Sun, Xiang Gao, Yue Yu, Xiaojun Liang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:25:40Z

**Summary**: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention, enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However, existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models, particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

### LVFace: Progressive Cluster Optimization for Large Vision Models in Face   Recognition
**Authors**: Jinghan You, Shanglin Li, Yuanrui Sun, Jiangchuan Wei, Mingyu Guo, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:23:48Z

**Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized large-scale visual modeling, yet remain underexplored in face recognition (FR) where CNNs still dominate. We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints. LVFace establishes a new state-of-the-art face recognition baseline, surpassing leading approaches such as UniFace and TopoFR across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVFace delivers consistent performance gains, while exhibiting scalability to large-scale datasets and compatibility with mainstream VLMs and LLMs. Notably, LVFace secured 1st place in the ICCV 2021 Masked Face Recognition (MFR)-Ongoing Challenge (March 2025), proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios. Project is available at https://github.com/bytedance/LVFace.

### SpecDetect: Simple, Fast, and Training-Free Detection of LLM-Generated   Text via Spectral Analysis
**Authors**: Haitong Luo, Weiyao Zhang, Suhang Wang, Wenji Zou, Chungang Lin, Xuying Meng, Yujun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:13:42Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs) demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

### CrossTrace: Efficient Cross-Thread and Cross-Service Span Correlation in   Distributed Tracing for Microservices
**Authors**: Linh-An Phan, MingXue Wang, Guangyu Wu, Wang Dawei, Chen Liqun, Li Jin

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:12:30Z

**Summary**: Distributed tracing has become an essential technique for debugging and troubleshooting modern microservice-based applications, enabling software engineers to detect performance bottlenecks, identify failures, and gain insights into system behavior. However, implementing distributed tracing in large-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive instrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions, such as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected without modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the process of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical challenge in zero-code approaches. Existing solutions often rely on thread affinity, compromise system security by requiring the kernel integrity mode to be disabled, or incur significant computational overhead due to complex inference algorithms. This paper presents CrossTrace, a practical and efficient distributed tracing solution designed to support the debugging of microservice applications without requiring source code modifications. CrossTrace employs a greedy algorithm to infer intra-service span relationships from delay patterns, eliminating reliance on thread identifiers. For inter-service correlation, CrossTrace embeds span identifiers into TCP packet headers via eBPF, enabling secure and efficient correlation compromising system security policies. Evaluation results show that CrossTrace can correlate thousands of spans within seconds with over 90% accuracy, making it suitable for production deployment and valuable for microservice observability and diagnosis.

### Neighbour-Driven Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders for Scalable   Structured Latent Modelling
**Authors**: Xinxing Shi, Xiaoyu Jiang, Mauricio A. Álvarez

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:10:03Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

### Learning to Be A Doctor: Searching for Effective Medical Agent   Architectures
**Authors**: Yangyang Zhuang, Wenjia Jiang, Jiayu Zhang, Ze Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Chi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:59:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks, and their application in the medical domain holds particular promise due to the demand for high generalizability and reliance on interdisciplinary knowledge. However, existing medical agent systems often rely on static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate diverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios. Motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper introduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent architectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent search space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured modifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework conceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse, functional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by diagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures and significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents the first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in real-world clinical environments.

### MoE-TTS: Enhancing Out-of-Domain Text Understanding for   Description-based TTS via Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Heyang Xue, Xuchen Song, Yu Tang, Jianyu Chen, Yanru Chen, Yang Li, Yahui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:53:56Z

**Summary**: Description-based text-to-speech (TTS) models exhibit strong performance on in-domain text descriptions, i.e., those encountered during training. However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at https://welkinyang.github.io/MoE-TTS/.

**Summary**: Quantization is an essential and popular technique for improving the accessibility of large language models (LLMs) by reducing memory usage and computational costs while maintaining performance. In this study, we apply 4-bit Group Scaling Quantization (GSQ) and Generative Pretrained Transformer Quantization (GPTQ) to LLaMA 1B, Qwen 0.5B, and PHI 1.5B, evaluating their impact across multiple NLP tasks. We benchmark these models on MS MARCO (Information Retrieval), BoolQ (Boolean Question Answering), and GSM8K (Mathematical Reasoning) datasets, assessing both accuracy and efficiency across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable decisions based on the specifications that need to be met. We discuss the pros and cons of GSQ and GPTQ techniques on models of different sizes, which also serve as a benchmark for future experiments.

### SGSimEval: A Comprehensive Multifaceted and Similarity-Enhanced   Benchmark for Automatic Survey Generation Systems
**Authors**: Beichen Guo, Zhiyuan Wen, Yu Yang, Peng Gao, Ruosong Yang, Jiaxing Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:27:58Z

**Summary**: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations, including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

### Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and   Reasoning
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Zhenhao Li, Zishuo Ding

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:20:09Z

**Summary**: Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored.   In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.

**Authors**: Rahul Jana, Shubham Dixit, Mrityunjay Sharma, Ritesh Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:12:18Z

**Summary**: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.

### Personalized LLM for Generating Customized Responses to the Same Query   from Different Users
**Authors**: Hang Zeng, Chaoyue Niu, Fan Wu, Chengfei Lv, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:12:16Z

**Summary**: Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLMs, but overlooked the diversity of queriers. In this work, we propose a new form of querier-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different queriers. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-querier general encoder and a querier-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same querier, while pulling apart those of different queriers. To mitigate the impact of query diversity on querier-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on query similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. To address the lack of datasets designed for querier-aware personalization, we also build a multi-querier dataset from English and Chinese scripts, as well as WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 queriers and 12 responders. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our design significantly improves the quality of personalized response generation, achieving relative improvement of 8.4% to 48.7% in ROUGE-L scores and winning rates ranging from 54% to 82% compared with various baseline methods.

### Training-Free Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration
**Authors**: Tianyu Xie, Yuhang Wu, Yongdong Luo, Jiayi Ji, Xiawu Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:09:53Z

**Summary**: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes.

### MMESGBench: Pioneering Multimodal Understanding and Complex Reasoning   Benchmark for ESG Tasks
**Authors**: Lei Zhang, Xin Zhou, Chaoyue He, Di Wang, Yi Wu, Hong Xu, Wei Liu, Chunyan Miao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:08:00Z

**Summary**: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports are essential for evaluating sustainability practices, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting financial transparency. However, these documents are often lengthy, structurally diverse, and multimodal, comprising dense text, structured tables, complex figures, and layout-dependent semantics. Existing AI systems often struggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no dedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we introduce \textbf{MMESGBench}, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted to evaluate multimodal understanding and complex reasoning across structurally diverse and multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a human-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates candidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting rich textual, tabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an LLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of each QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop validation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure quality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs derived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types and three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as single-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained multimodal evidence. Initial experiments validate that multimodal and retrieval-augmented models substantially outperform text-only baselines, particularly on visually grounded and cross-page tasks. MMESGBench is publicly available as an open-source dataset at https://github.com/Zhanglei1103/MMESGBench.

### Dynamic Quality-Latency Aware Routing for LLM Inference in Wireless   Edge-Device Networks
**Authors**: Rui Bao, Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:55:05Z

**Summary**: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

### SafeConstellations: Steering LLM Safety to Reduce Over-Refusals Through   Task-Specific Trajectory
**Authors**: Utsav Maskey, Sumit Yadav, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:54:42Z

**Summary**: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

### CSGO: Generalized Optimization for Cold Start in Wireless Collaborative   Edge LLM Systems
**Authors**: Xuran Liu, Nan Xue, Rui Bao, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Xiaodong Xu, Shuguang Cui

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:49:22Z

**Summary**: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources. Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.

### AI in Mental Health: Emotional and Sentiment Analysis of Large Language   Models' Responses to Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Queries
**Authors**: Arya VarastehNezhad, Reza Tavasoli, Soroush Elyasi, MohammadHossein LotfiNia, Hamed Farbeh

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:47:10Z

**Summary**: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models (LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values. Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user experience and outcomes.

### ToxiFrench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Language Models via CoT   Fine-Tuning for French Toxicity Detection
**Authors**: Axel Delaval, Shujian Yang, Haicheng Wang, Han Qiu, Jialiang Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:40:41Z

**Summary**: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging. While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10% through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then, we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight: Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision, significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability, suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages and safety-critical classification tasks.

### Towards Consumer-Grade Cybersickness Prediction: Multi-Model Alignment   for Real-Time Vision-Only Inference
**Authors**: Yitong Zhu, Zhuowen Liang, Yiming Wu, Tangyao Li, Yuyang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:40:14Z

**Summary**: Cybersickness remains a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of immersive virtual reality (VR), particularly in consumer-grade environments. While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance. The code will be relesed at https://github.com/U235-Aurora/PTGNN.

### LETToT: Label-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models On Tourism Using   Expert Tree-of-Thought
**Authors**: Ruiyan Qi, Congding Wen, Weibo Zhou, Shangsong Liang, Lingbo Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:37:12Z

**Summary**: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free $\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert $\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales (32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness ($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional annotated benchmarks.

### Is General-Purpose AI Reasoning Sensitive to Data-Induced Cognitive   Biases? Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas
**Authors**: Francesco Sovrano, Gabriele Dominici, Rita Sevastjanova, Alessandra Stramiglio, Alberto Bacchelli

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:29:46Z

**Summary**: Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases?   To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions.   To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the embedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased reasoners.   We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning. All systems exhibit cognitive biases (ranging from 5.9% to 35% across types), with bias sensitivity increasing sharply with task complexity (up to 49%), highlighting critical risks in real-world software engineering deployments.

### Probing the Representational Power of Sparse Autoencoders in Vision   Models
**Authors**: Matthew Lyle Olson, Musashi Hinck, Neale Ratzlaff, Changbai Li, Phillip Howard, Vasudev Lal, Shao-Yen Tseng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:29:42Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

### Inference performance evaluation for LLMs on edge devices with a novel   benchmarking framework and metric
**Authors**: Hao Chen, Cong Tian, Zixuan He, Bin Yu, Yepang Liu, Jialun Cao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:08:46Z

**Summary**: With the significant success achieved by large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, edge computing-based LLM inference services for mobile and PC are in high demand for data privacy. However, different edge platforms have different hardware characteristics and the large demand for memory capacity and bandwidth makes it very challenging to deploy and benchmark LLMs on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking tool named ELIB (edge LLM inference benchmarking) to evaluate LLM inference performance of different edge platforms, and propose a novel metric named MBU to indicate the percentage of the theoretically efficient use of available memory bandwidth for a specific model running on edge hardware to optimize memory usage. We deploy ELIB on three edge platforms and benchmark using five quantized models to optimize MBU in combination with other metrics such as FLOPS, throughput, latency and accuracy. And we analyze the results to derive the key factors, constraints, unpredictability in optimizing MBU that can guide deploying LLMs on more edge platforms.

### UNVEILING: What Makes Linguistics Olympiad Puzzles Tricky for LLMs?
**Authors**: Mukund Choudhary, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Gaurja Aeron, Antara Raaghavi Bhattacharya, Dang Khoa Dang Dinh, Ikhlasul Akmal Hanif, Daria Kotova, Ekaterina Kochmar, Monojit Choudhury

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:53:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

### Group Fairness Meets the Black Box: Enabling Fair Algorithms on Closed   LLMs via Post-Processing
**Authors**: Ruicheng Xian, Yuxuan Wan, Han Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:50:29Z

**Summary**: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

### Hallucination in LLM-Based Code Generation: An Automotive Case Study
**Authors**: Marc Pavel, Nenad Petrovic, Lukasz Mazur, Vahid Zolfaghari, Fengjunjie Pan, Alois Knoll

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:46:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect, unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.

### A Computationally Efficient Maximum A Posteriori Sequence Estimation via   Stein Variational Inference
**Authors**: Min-Won Seo, Solmaz S. Kia

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:37:14Z

**Summary**: State estimation in robotic systems presents significant challenges, particularly due to the prevalence of multimodal posterior distributions in real-world scenarios. One effective strategy for handling such complexity is to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequences over a discretized or sampled state space, which enables a concise representation of the most likely state trajectory. However, this approach often incurs substantial computational costs, especially in high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a novel MAP sequence estimation method, \textsf{Stein-MAP-Seq}, which effectively addresses multimodality while substantially reducing computational and memory overhead. Our key contribution is a sequential variational inference framework that captures temporal dependencies in dynamical system models and integrates Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) into a Viterbi-style dynamic programming algorithm, enabling computationally efficient MAP sequence estimation. \textsf{Stein-MAP-Seq} achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$, where $M$ is the number of particles, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of conventional MAP sequence estimators, with $N \gg M$. Furthermore, the method inherits SVGD's parallelism, enabling efficient computation for real-time deployment on GPU-equipped autonomous systems. We validate the proposed method in various multimodal scenarios, including those arising from nonlinear dynamics with ambiguous observations, unknown data associations, and temporary unobservability, demonstrating substantial improvements in estimation accuracy and robustness to multimodality over existing approaches.

### Cross-Granularity Hypergraph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for   Multi-hop Question Answering
**Authors**: Changjian Wang, Weihong Deng, Weili Guan, Quan Lu, Ning Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:36:13Z

**Summary**: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a 6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

### Mitigating Filter Bubble from the Perspective of Community Detection: A   Universal Framework
**Authors**: Ming Tang, Xiaowen Huang, Jitao Sang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:57:38Z

**Summary**: In recent years, recommender systems have primarily focused on improving accuracy at the expense of diversity, which exacerbates the well-known filter bubble effect. This paper proposes a universal framework called CD-CGCN to address the filter bubble issue in recommender systems from a community detection perspective. By analyzing user-item interaction histories with a community detection algorithm, we reveal that state-of-the-art recommendations often focus on intra-community items, worsening the filter bubble effect. CD-CGCN, a model-agnostic framework, integrates a Conditional Discriminator and a Community-reweighted Graph Convolutional Network which can be plugged into most recommender models. Using adversarial learning based on community labels, it counteracts the extracted community attributes and incorporates an inference strategy tailored to the user's specific filter bubble state. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with multiple base models validate its effectiveness in mitigating filter bubbles while preserving recommendation quality. Additionally, by applying community debiasing to the original test set to construct an unbiased test set, we observe that CD-CGCN demonstrates superior performance in capturing users' inter-community preferences.

### Enabling low-power massive MIMO with ternary ADCs for AIoT sensing
**Authors**: Shengheng Liu, Ningning Fu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:49:40Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of networked devices and the surging demand for ubiquitous intelligence have given rise to the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). However, the utilization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and numerous radio frequency chains significantly raises power consumption. This paper explores a cost-effective solution using ternary ADCs (T-ADCs) in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems for low-power AIoT and specifically addresses channel sensing challenges. The channel is first estimated through a pilot-aided scheme and refined using a joint-pilot-and-data (JPD) approach. To assess the performance limits of this two-threshold ADC system, the analysis includes its hardware-ideal counterpart, the parallel one-bit ADCs (PO-ADCs) and a realistic scenario where noise variance is unknown at the receiver is considered. Analytical findings indicate that the JPD scheme effectively mitigates performance degradation in channel estimation due to coarse quantization effects under mild conditions, without necessitating additional pilot overhead. For deterministic and random channels, we propose modified expectation maximization (EM) and variational inference EM estimators, respectively. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in terms of mean square error and symbol error rate, which showcases the feasibility of implementing T-ADCs and the associated JPD scheme for greener AIoT smart sensing.

### Embodied Edge Intelligence Meets Near Field Communication: Concept,   Design, and Verification
**Authors**: Guoliang Li, Xibin Jin, Yujie Wan, Chenxuan Liu, Tong Zhang, Shuai Wang, Chengzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:43:41Z

**Summary**: Realizing embodied artificial intelligence is challenging due to the huge computation demands of large models (LMs). To support LMs while ensuring real-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm, which leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to embodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral efficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user interference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which leverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an ideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC, resulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC designs, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both functionalities. To this end, we propose radio-friendly embodied planning for EEI-assisted NFC scenarios and view-guided beam-focusing for NFC-assisted EEI scenarios. We also elaborate how to realize resource-efficient NEEI through opportunistic collaborative navigation. Experimental results are provided to confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques compared with various benchmarks.

### TokenRec: Learning to Tokenize ID for LLM-based Generative   Recommendation
**Authors**: Haohao Qu, Wenqi Fan, Zihuai Zhao, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:34:06Z

**Summary**: There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.

### An Efficient Deep Learning Approach for Approximating   Parameter-to-Solution Maps of PDEs
**Authors**: Guanhang Lei, Zhen Lei, Lei Shi, Chenyu Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:27:45Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we consider approximating the parameter-to-solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PPDEs) using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose an efficient approach combining reduced collocation methods (RCMs) and DNNs. In the approximation analysis section, we rigorously derive sharp upper bounds on the complexity of the neural networks. These bounds only depend on the reduced basis dimension rather than the high-fidelity discretization dimension, thereby theoretically guaranteeing the computational efficiency of our approach. In numerical experiments, we implement the RCM using radial basis function finite differences (RBF-FD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and propose the POD-DNN algorithm. We consider various types of PPDEs and compare the accuracy and efficiency of different solvers. The POD-DNN has demonstrated significantly accelerated inference speeds compared with conventional numerical methods owing to the offline-online computation strategy. Furthermore, by employing the reduced basis methods (RBMs), it also outperforms standard DNNs in computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Is ChatGPT-5 Ready for Mammogram VQA?
**Authors**: Qiang Li, Shansong Wang, Mingzhe Hu, Mojtaba Safari, Zachary Eidex, Xiaofeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:56:24Z

**Summary**: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening. We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment, abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%), calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0% malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with mammography VQA tasks.

### Controlling Multimodal LLMs via Reward-guided Decoding
**Authors**: Oscar Mañas, Pierluca D'Oro, Koustuv Sinha, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Aishwarya Agrawal

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:29:06Z

**Summary**: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.

### A Dual-Perspective NLG Meta-Evaluation Framework with Automatic   Benchmark and Better Interpretability
**Authors**: Xinyu Hu, Mingqi Gao, Li Lin, Zhenghan Yu, Xiaojun Wan

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:10:35Z

**Summary**: In NLG meta-evaluation, evaluation metrics are typically assessed based on their consistency with humans. However, we identify some limitations in traditional NLG meta-evaluation approaches, such as issues in handling human ratings and ambiguous selections of correlation measures, which undermine the effectiveness of meta-evaluation. In this work, we propose a dual-perspective NLG meta-evaluation framework that focuses on different evaluation capabilities, thereby providing better interpretability. In addition, we introduce a method of automatically constructing the corresponding benchmarks without requiring new human annotations. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with 16 representative LLMs as the evaluators based on our proposed framework, comprehensively analyzing their evaluation performance from different perspectives.

### CryptoScope: Utilizing Large Language Models for Automated Cryptographic   Logic Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Zhihao Li, Zimo Ji, Tao Zheng, Hao Ren, Xiao Lan

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T17:07:54Z

**Summary**: Cryptographic algorithms are fundamental to modern security, yet their implementations frequently harbor subtle logic flaws that are hard to detect. We introduce CryptoScope, a novel framework for automated cryptographic vulnerability detection powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). CryptoScope combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), guided by a curated cryptographic knowledge base containing over 12,000 entries. We evaluate CryptoScope on LLM-CLVA, a benchmark of 92 cases primarily derived from real-world CVE vulnerabilities, complemented by cryptographic challenges from major Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and synthetic examples across 11 programming languages. CryptoScope consistently improves performance over strong LLM baselines, boosting DeepSeek-V3 by 11.62%, GPT-4o-mini by 20.28%, and GLM-4-Flash by 28.69%. Additionally, it identifies 9 previously undisclosed flaws in widely used open-source cryptographic projects.

### It's not a FAD: first results in using Flows for unsupervised Anomaly   Detection at 40 MHz at the Large Hadron Collider
**Authors**: Francesco Vaselli, Maurizio Pierini, Maciej Mikolaj Glowacki, Thea Aarrestad, Katya Govorkova, Vladimir Loncar, Dimitrios Danopoulos, Felice Pantaleo

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:58:10Z

**Summary**: We present the first implementation of a Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) model for unsupervised anomaly detection within the realistic, high-rate environment of the Large Hadron Collider's L1 trigger systems. While CNFs typically define an anomaly score via a probabilistic likelihood, calculating this score requires solving an Ordinary Differential Equation, a procedure too complex for FPGA deployment. To overcome this, we propose a novel, hardware-friendly anomaly score defined as the squared norm of the model's vector field output. This score is based on the intuition that anomalous events require a larger transformation by the flow. Our model, trained via Flow Matching on Standard Model-like data, is synthesized for an FPGA using the hls4ml library. We demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies a variety of beyond-the-Standard-Model signatures with performance comparable to existing machine learning-based triggers. The algorithm achieves a latency of a few hundred nanoseconds and requires minimal FPGA resources, establishing CNFs as a viable new tool for real-time, data-driven discovery at 40 MHz.

### Pr$εε$mpt: Sanitizing Sensitive Prompts for LLMs
**Authors**: Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, Mihir Bellare

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:46:42Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

### Aware First, Think Less: Dynamic Boundary Self-Awareness Drives Extreme   Reasoning Efficiency in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Dengyun Peng, Jinhao Liu, HuiKang Su, Jiannan Guan, Libo Qin, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:40:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism. These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16% accuracy improvement.

### Why Report Failed Interactions With Robots?! Towards Vignette-based   Interaction Quality
**Authors**: Agnes Axelsson, Merle Reimann, Ronald Cumbal, Hannah Pelikan, Divesh Lala

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T16:07:03Z

**Summary**: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing interaction evaluation methods.

### SeamlessFlow: A Trainer Agent Isolation RL Framework Achieving   Bubble-Free Pipelines via Tag Scheduling

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:55:37Z

**Summary**: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL) framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1) decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2) maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First, SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations, SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

### Copyright Protection for Large Language Models: A Survey of Methods,   Challenges, and Trends
**Authors**: Zhenhua Xu, Xubin Yue, Zhebo Wang, Qichen Liu, Xixiang Zhao, Jingxuan Zhang, Wenjun Zeng, Wengpeng Xing, Dezhang Kong, Changting Lin, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:50:20Z

**Summary**: Copyright protection for large language models is of critical importance, given their substantial development costs, proprietary value, and potential for misuse. Existing surveys have predominantly focused on techniques for tracing LLM-generated content-namely, text watermarking-while a systematic exploration of methods for protecting the models themselves (i.e., model watermarking and model fingerprinting) remains absent. Moreover, the relationships and distinctions among text watermarking, model watermarking, and model fingerprinting have not been comprehensively clarified. This work presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of LLM copyright protection technologies, with a focus on model fingerprinting, covering the following aspects: (1) clarifying the conceptual connection from text watermarking to model watermarking and fingerprinting, and adopting a unified terminology that incorporates model watermarking into the broader fingerprinting framework; (2) providing an overview and comparison of diverse text watermarking techniques, highlighting cases where such methods can function as model fingerprinting; (3) systematically categorizing and comparing existing model fingerprinting approaches for LLM copyright protection; (4) presenting, for the first time, techniques for fingerprint transfer and fingerprint removal; (5) summarizing evaluation metrics for model fingerprints, including effectiveness, harmlessness, robustness, stealthiness, and reliability; and (6) discussing open challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer researchers a thorough understanding of both text watermarking and model fingerprinting technologies in the era of LLMs, thereby fostering further advances in protecting their intellectual property.

### Towards Fully Onboard State Estimation and Trajectory Tracking for UAVs   with Suspended Payloads
**Authors**: Martin Jiroušek, Tomáš Báča, Martin Saska

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:48:42Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle hardware.

**Authors**: Shangpin Peng, Weinong Wang, Zhuotao Tian, Senqiao Yang, Xing Wu, Haotian Xu, Chengquan Zhang, Takashi Isobe, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:40:50Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

### Language models align with brain regions that represent concepts across   modalities
**Authors**: Maria Ryskina, Greta Tuckute, Alexander Fung, Ashley Malkin, Evelina Fedorenko

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:32:19Z

**Summary**: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences, targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image) using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

### Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Monika Jotautaitė, Lucius Caviola, David A. Brewster, Thilo Hagendorff

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:22:00Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias -- discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1) SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals. These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes in AI systems and the societies they influence.

### An Efficient Medical Image Classification Method Based on a Lightweight   Improved ConvNeXt-Tiny Architecture
**Authors**: Jingsong Xia, Yue Yin, Xiuhan Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:20:25Z

**Summary**: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction capability and classification performance while reducing computational complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module, termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead. Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance. Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs, exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging analysis models.

### A Comprehensive Perspective on Explainable AI across the Machine   Learning Workflow
**Authors**: George Paterakis, Andrea Castellani, George Papoutsoglou, Tobias Rodemann, Ioannis Tsamardinos

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:15:25Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up, learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts, data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs; our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles, this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel, end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI deployment.

### Inspire or Predict? Exploring New Paradigms in Assisting Classical   Planners with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wenkai Yu, Jianhang Tang, Yang Zhang, Shanjiang Tang, Kebing Jin, Hankz Hankui Zhuo

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T15:08:07Z

**Summary**: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge within LLMs.

### DiCriTest: Testing Scenario Generation for Decision-Making Agents   Considering Diversity and Criticality
**Authors**: Qitong Chu, Yufeng Yue, Danya Yao, Huaxin Pei

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:51:45Z

**Summary**: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space, agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

### Towards Faithful Class-level Self-explainability in Graph Neural   Networks by Subgraph Dependencies
**Authors**: Fanzhen Liu, Xiaoxiao Ma, Jian Yang, Alsharif Abuadbba, Kristen Moore, Surya Nepal, Cecile Paris, Quan Z. Sheng, Jia Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:44:11Z

**Summary**: Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

### Sim2Dust: Mastering Dynamic Waypoint Tracking on Granular Media
**Authors**: Andrej Orsula, Matthieu Geist, Miguel Olivares-Mendez, Carol Martinez

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:30:07Z

**Summary**: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

### From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility   Systems
**Authors**: Jiangbo Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:21:57Z

**Summary**: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are viewed as vehicular systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing pre-programmed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 0 to 5); Examples of this outpace include the interaction with humans with natural language, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and unseen ethical dilemma handling, largely empowered by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this gap, this paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper proposes the term AgVs and their distinguishing characteristics from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in integrating LLMs and AuVs and highlights how AgVs might transform future mobility systems and ensure the systems are human-centered. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, and how they can play a significant role in future agentic transportation systems.

### MetaAgents: Large Language Model Based Agents for Decision-Making on   Teaming
**Authors**: Yuan Li, Lichao Sun, Yixuan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:18:48Z

**Summary**: Significant advancements have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulations. Despite this, their abilities to perform teaming in task-oriented social events are underexplored. Such capabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social behaviors and form efficient teams to solve tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaAgents, a social simulation framework populated with LLM-based agents. MetaAgents facilitates agent engagement in conversations and a series of decision making within social contexts, serving as an appropriate platform for investigating interactions and interpersonal decision-making of agents. In particular, we construct a job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize the team assembly and skill-matching behaviors of LLM-based agents. We take advantage of both quantitative metrics evaluation and qualitative text analysis to assess their teaming abilities at the job fair. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-based agents perform competently in making rational decisions to develop efficient teams. However, we also identify limitations that hinder their effectiveness in more complex team assembly tasks. Our work provides valuable insights into the role and evolution of LLMs in task-oriented social simulations.

**Authors**: Xiaoxue Gao, Huayun Zhang, Nancy F. Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T14:15:19Z

**Summary**: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.

### DSperse: A Framework for Targeted Verification in Zero-Knowledge Machine   Learning
**Authors**: Dan Ivanov, Tristan Freiberg, Shirin Shahabi, Jonathan Gold, Haruna Isah

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:42:28Z

**Summary**: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.

### TRACY: Benchmarking Execution Efficiency of LLM-Based Code Translation
**Authors**: Zhihao Gong, Zeyu Sun, Dong Huang, Qingyuan Liang, Jie M. Zhang, Dan Hao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:33:52Z

**Summary**: Automatic code translation is a fundamental task in modern software development. While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the correctness of code translation, the critical dimension of execution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce TRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven two-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to amplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task pruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting benchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python, each accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10 computationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative LLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient code translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for correctness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account, surpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that algorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental, causing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\times$ and memory increase of 12.0$\times$, respectively. Our work underscores the necessity of jointly optimizing for correctness and efficiency in future LLM-based code translation.

### Reference Points in LLM Sentiment Analysis: The Role of Structured   Context
**Authors**: Junichiro Niimi

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:04:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields, including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

### EvoPSF: Online Evolution of Autonomous Driving Models via Planning-State   Feedback
**Authors**: Jiayue Jin, Lang Qian, Jingyu Zhang, Chuanyu Ju, Liang Song

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:00:55Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in autonomous driving, with systems evolving from modular pipelines to end-to-end architectures. However, most existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new environments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability diminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we break away from the conventional "train once, deploy forever" paradigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous driving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are primarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such failures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To address this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution, using it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than performing blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to identify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are primarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we compute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints from the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from the perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then backpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the model's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion predictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors. Experiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under challenging conditions.

### Inclusion Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating Large Foundation Models   with Real-World Apps
**Authors**: Kangyu Wang, Hongliang He, Lin Liu, Ruiqi Liang, Zhenzhong Lan, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T13:00:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is publicly accessible at https://doraemon.alipay.com/model-ranking.

### Inside Knowledge: Graph-based Path Generation with Explainable Data   Augmentation and Curriculum Learning for Visual Indoor Navigation
**Authors**: Daniel Airinei, Elena Burceanu, Marius Leordeanu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:54:13Z

**Summary**: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning, includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the correct next direction towards different specific target destinations. Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and code available along with visual demos on our project site

### Online Anti-sexist Speech: Identifying Resistance to Gender Bias in   Political Discourse
**Authors**: Aditi Dutta, Susan Banducci

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:24:22Z

**Summary**: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist, anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year 2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices. We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital political spaces.

### Relationship Detection on Tabular Data Using Statistical Analysis and   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Panagiotis Koletsis, Christos Panagiotopoulos, Georgios Th. Papadopoulos, Vasilis Efthymiou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:22:31Z

**Summary**: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

**Summary**: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.

### EllieSQL: Cost-Efficient Text-to-SQL with Complexity-Aware Routing
**Authors**: Yizhang Zhu, Runzhi Jiang, Boyan Li, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:08:35Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL automatically translates natural language queries to SQL, allowing non-technical users to retrieve data from databases without specialized SQL knowledge. Despite the success of advanced LLM-based Text-to-SQL approaches on leaderboards, their unsustainable computational costs--often overlooked--stand as the "elephant in the room" in current leaderboard-driven research, limiting their economic practicability for real-world deployment and widespread adoption. To tackle this, we exploratively propose EllieSQL, a complexity-aware routing framework that assigns queries to suitable SQL generation pipelines based on estimated complexity. We investigate multiple routers to direct simple queries to efficient approaches while reserving computationally intensive methods for complex cases. Drawing from economics, we introduce the Token Elasticity of Performance (TEP) metric, capturing cost-efficiency by quantifying the responsiveness of performance gains relative to token investment in SQL generation. Experiments show that compared to always using the most advanced methods in our study, EllieSQL with the Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO router reduces token use by over 40% without compromising performance on Bird development set, achieving more than a 2x boost in TEP over non-routing approaches. This not only advances the pursuit of cost-efficient Text-to-SQL but also invites the community to weigh resource efficiency alongside performance, contributing to progress in sustainable Text-to-SQL. Our source code and model are available at https://elliesql.github.io/.

### HumorPlanSearch: Structured Planning and HuCoT for Contextual AI Humor
**Authors**: Shivam Dubey

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:07:56Z

**Summary**: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score (HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates, and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13 human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent (p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

### Tapas are free! Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via   LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments
**Authors**: Jinwei Hu, Yi Dong, Youcheng Sun, Xiaowei Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T12:02:46Z

**Summary**: Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.

### Feather-SQL: A Lightweight NL2SQL Framework with Dual-Model   Collaboration Paradigm for Small Language Models
**Authors**: Wenqi Pei, Hailing Xu, Hengyuan Zhao, Shizheng Hou, Han Chen, Zining Zhang, Pingyi Luo, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:48:28Z

**Summary**: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) has seen significant advancements with large language models (LLMs). However, these models often depend on closed-source systems and high computational resources, posing challenges in data privacy and deployment. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) struggle with NL2SQL tasks, exhibiting poor performance and incompatibility with existing frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce Feather-SQL, a new lightweight framework tailored for SLMs. Feather-SQL improves SQL executability and accuracy through 1) schema pruning and linking, 2) multi-path and multi-candidate generation. Additionally, we introduce the 1+1 Model Collaboration Paradigm, which pairs a strong general-purpose chat model with a fine-tuned SQL specialist, combining strong analytical reasoning with high-precision SQL generation. Experimental results on BIRD demonstrate that Feather-SQL improves NL2SQL performance on SLMs, with around 10% boost for models without fine-tuning. The proposed paradigm raises the accuracy ceiling of SLMs to 54.76%, highlighting its effectiveness.

### AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF
**Authors**: Yusheng Zheng, Yanpeng Hu, Tong Yu, Andi Quinn

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:45:40Z

**Summary**: Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.

### AIM-Bench: Evaluating Decision-making Biases of Agentic LLM as Inventory   Manager
**Authors**: Xuhua Zhao, Yuxuan Xie, Caihua Chen, Yuxiang Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:38:19Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support systems for supply chains.

### Survey-to-Behavior: Downstream Alignment of Human Values in LLMs via   Survey Questions
**Authors**: Shangrui Nie, Florian Mai, David Kaczér, Charles Welch, Zhixue Zhao, Lucie Flek

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:36:17Z

**Summary**: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in implicit downstream task behavior.

### Towards Embodied Conversational Agents for Reducing Oral Exam Anxiety in   Extended Reality
**Authors**: Jens Grubert, Yvonne Sedelmaier, Dieter Landes

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:33:03Z

**Summary**: Oral examinations are a prevalent but psychologically demanding form of assessment in higher education. Many students experience intense anxiety, which can impair cognitive performance and hinder academic success. This position paper explores the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in extended reality (XR) environments to support students preparing for oral exams. We propose a system concept that integrates photorealistic ECAs with real-time capable large language models (LLMs) to enable psychologically safe, adaptive, and repeatable rehearsal of oral examination scenarios. We also discuss the potential benefits and challenges of such an envisioned system.

### RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator
**Authors**: Zhiming Liu, Nantheera Anantrasirichai

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:20:18Z

**Summary**: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric turbulence suppression tasks.

### On-Policy RL Meets Off-Policy Experts: Harmonizing Supervised   Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting
**Authors**: Wenhao Zhang, Yuexiang Xie, Yuchang Sun, Yanxi Chen, Guoyin Wang, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:20:03Z

**Summary**: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines. We release the implementation at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to inspire further research.

### FACET:Teacher-Centred LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems-Towards Personalized   Educational Worksheets
**Authors**: Jana Gonnermann-Müller, Jennifer Haase, Konstantin Fackeldey, Sebastian Pokutta

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:10:40Z

**Summary**: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.

### Trustworthy AI Psychotherapy: Multi-Agent LLM Workflow for Counseling   and Explainable Mental Disorder Diagnosis
**Authors**: Mithat Can Ozgun, Jiahuan Pei, Koen Hindriks, Lucia Donatelli, Qingzhi Liu, Xin Sun, Junxiao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:08:32Z

**Summary**: LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

### Synthesizing Evidence: Data-Pooling as a Tool for Treatment Selection in   Online Experiments
**Authors**: Zhenkang Peng, Chengzhang Li, Ying Rong, Renyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T11:01:26Z

**Summary**: Randomized experiments are the gold standard for causal inference but face significant challenges in business applications, including limited traffic allocation, the need for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and the complexity of managing overlapping experiments. These factors lead to high variability in treatment effect estimates, making data-driven policy roll out difficult. To address these issues, we introduce the data pooling treatment roll-out (DPTR) framework, which enhances policy roll-out by pooling data across experiments rather than focusing narrowly on individual ones. DPTR can effectively accommodate both overlapping and non-overlapping traffic scenarios, regardless of linear or nonlinear model specifications. We demonstrate the framework's robustness through a three-pronged validation: (a) theoretical analysis shows that DPTR surpasses the traditional difference-in-mean and ordinary least squares methods under non-overlapping experiments, particularly when the number of experiments is large; (b) synthetic simulations confirm its adaptability in complex scenarios with overlapping traffic, rich covariates and nonlinear specifications; and (c) empirical applications to two experimental datasets from real world platforms, demonstrating its effectiveness in guiding customized policy roll-outs for subgroups within a single experiment, as well as in coordinating policy deployments across multiple experiments with overlapping scenarios. By reducing estimation variability to improve decision-making effectiveness, DPTR provides a scalable, practical solution for online platforms to better leverage their experimental data in today's increasingly complex business environments.

### The Roots of International Perceptions: Simulating US Attitude Changes   Towards China with LLM Agents
**Authors**: Nicholas Sukiennik, Yichuan Xu, Yuqing Kan, Jinghua Piao, Yuwei Yan, Chen Gao, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:48:46Z

**Summary**: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.

### Retrieval-augmented reasoning with lean language models
**Authors**: Ryan Sze-Yin Chan, Federico Nanni, Tomas Lazauskas, Rosie Wood, Penelope Yong, Lionel Tarassenko, Mark Girolami, James Geddes, Andrew Duncan

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:38:15Z

**Summary**: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

### AirTrafficGen: Configurable Air Traffic Scenario Generation with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Dewi Sid William Gould, George De Ath, Ben Carvell, Nick Pepper

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:37:36Z

**Summary**: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, $\texttt{AirTrafficGen}$, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.

**Authors**: Mikhail Seleznyov, Mikhail Chaichuk, Gleb Ershov, Alexander Panchenko, Elena Tutubalina, Oleg Somov

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:32:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to subtle, non-semantic variations in prompt phrasing and formatting. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of 5 methods for improving prompt robustness within a unified experimental framework. We benchmark these techniques on 8 models from Llama, Qwen and Gemma families across 52 tasks from Natural Instructions dataset. Our evaluation covers robustness methods from both fine-tuned and in-context learning paradigms, and tests their generalization against multiple types of distribution shifts. Finally, we extend our analysis to GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 to assess frontier models' current robustness to format perturbations. Our findings offer actionable insights into the relative effectiveness of these robustness methods, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions when aiming for stable and reliable LLM performance in real-world applications.

### Unified Knowledge Distillation Framework: Fine-Grained Alignment and   Geometric Relationship Preservation for Deep Face Recognition
**Authors**: Durgesh Mishra, Rishabh Uikey

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T10:20:29Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices. Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions, Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy, thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

### Feedback Indicators: The Alignment between Llama and a Teacher in   Language Learning
**Authors**: Sylvio Rüdian, Yassin Elsir, Marvin Kretschmer, Sabine Cayrou, Niels Pinkwart

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:59:22Z

**Summary**: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable and transparent formative feedback in future research.

### Can We Tell if ChatGPT is a Parasite? Studying Human-AI Symbiosis with   Game Theory
**Authors**: Jiejun Hu-Bolz, James Stovold

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:54:13Z

**Summary**: This work asks whether a human interacting with a generative AI system can merge into a single individual through iterative, information-driven interactions. We model the interactions between a human, a generative AI system, and the human's wider environment as a three-player stochastic game. We use information-theoretic measures (entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy) to show that our modelled human and generative AI are able to form an aggregate individual in the sense of Krakauer et al. (2020). The model we present is able to answer interesting questions around the symbiotic nature of humans and AI systems, including whether LLM-driven chatbots are acting as parasites, feeding on the information provided by humans.

### ETTRL: Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Test-Time   Reinforcement Learning Via Entropy Mechanism
**Authors**: Jia Liu, ChangYi He, YingQiao Lin, MingMin Yang, FeiYang Shen, ShaoGuo Liu, TingTing Gao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:49:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

### Visual-RAG: Benchmarking Text-to-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation   for Visual Knowledge Intensive Queries
**Authors**: Yin Wu, Quanyu Long, Jing Li, Jianfei Yu, Wenya Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:45:15Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a paradigm that augments large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge to tackle knowledge-intensive question answering. While several benchmarks evaluate Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) under Multimodal RAG settings, they predominantly retrieve from textual corpora and do not explicitly assess how models exploit visual evidence during generation. Consequently, there still lacks benchmark that isolates and measures the contribution of retrieved images in RAG. We introduce Visual-RAG, a question-answering benchmark that targets visually grounded, knowledge-intensive questions. Unlike prior work, Visual-RAG requires text-to-image retrieval and the integration of retrieved clue images to extract visual evidence for answer generation. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-source and 3 proprietary MLLMs, showcasing that images provide strong evidence in augmented generation. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle to efficiently extract and utilize visual knowledge. Our results highlight the need for improved visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution in multimodal RAG systems.

### RULEBREAKERS: Challenging LLMs at the Crossroads between Formal Logic   and Human-like Reasoning
**Authors**: Jason Chan, Robert Gaizauskas, Zhixue Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:41:39Z

**Summary**: Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

### LVFace: Progressive Cluster Optimization for Large Vision Models in Face   Recognition
**Authors**: Jinghan You, Shanglin Li, Yuanrui Sun, Jiangchuan Wei, Mingyu Guo, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:23:48Z

**Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized large-scale visual modeling, yet remain underexplored in face recognition (FR) where CNNs still dominate. We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints. LVFace establishes a new state-of-the-art face recognition baseline, surpassing leading approaches such as UniFace and TopoFR across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVFace delivers consistent performance gains, while exhibiting scalability to large-scale datasets and compatibility with mainstream VLMs and LLMs. Notably, LVFace secured 1st place in the ICCV 2021 Masked Face Recognition (MFR)-Ongoing Challenge (March 2025), proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios. Project is available at https://github.com/bytedance/LVFace.

### SpecDetect: Simple, Fast, and Training-Free Detection of LLM-Generated   Text via Spectral Analysis
**Authors**: Haitong Luo, Weiyao Zhang, Suhang Wang, Wenji Zou, Chungang Lin, Xuying Meng, Yujun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:13:42Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs) demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

### CrossTrace: Efficient Cross-Thread and Cross-Service Span Correlation in   Distributed Tracing for Microservices
**Authors**: Linh-An Phan, MingXue Wang, Guangyu Wu, Wang Dawei, Chen Liqun, Li Jin

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T09:12:30Z

**Summary**: Distributed tracing has become an essential technique for debugging and troubleshooting modern microservice-based applications, enabling software engineers to detect performance bottlenecks, identify failures, and gain insights into system behavior. However, implementing distributed tracing in large-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive instrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions, such as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected without modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the process of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical challenge in zero-code approaches. Existing solutions often rely on thread affinity, compromise system security by requiring the kernel integrity mode to be disabled, or incur significant computational overhead due to complex inference algorithms. This paper presents CrossTrace, a practical and efficient distributed tracing solution designed to support the debugging of microservice applications without requiring source code modifications. CrossTrace employs a greedy algorithm to infer intra-service span relationships from delay patterns, eliminating reliance on thread identifiers. For inter-service correlation, CrossTrace embeds span identifiers into TCP packet headers via eBPF, enabling secure and efficient correlation compromising system security policies. Evaluation results show that CrossTrace can correlate thousands of spans within seconds with over 90% accuracy, making it suitable for production deployment and valuable for microservice observability and diagnosis.

### Learning to Be A Doctor: Searching for Effective Medical Agent   Architectures
**Authors**: Yangyang Zhuang, Wenjia Jiang, Jiayu Zhang, Ze Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Chi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:59:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks, and their application in the medical domain holds particular promise due to the demand for high generalizability and reliance on interdisciplinary knowledge. However, existing medical agent systems often rely on static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate diverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios. Motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper introduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent architectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent search space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured modifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework conceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse, functional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by diagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures and significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents the first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in real-world clinical environments.

### MoE-TTS: Enhancing Out-of-Domain Text Understanding for   Description-based TTS via Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Heyang Xue, Xuchen Song, Yu Tang, Jianyu Chen, Yanru Chen, Yang Li, Yahui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:53:56Z

**Summary**: Description-based text-to-speech (TTS) models exhibit strong performance on in-domain text descriptions, i.e., those encountered during training. However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at https://welkinyang.github.io/MoE-TTS/.

**Authors**: Sahil Sk, Debasish Dhal, Sonal Khosla, Sk Shahid, Sambit Shekhar, Akash Dhaka, Shantipriya Parida, Dilip K. Prasad, Ondřej Bojar

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:41:20Z

**Summary**: Quantization is an essential and popular technique for improving the accessibility of large language models (LLMs) by reducing memory usage and computational costs while maintaining performance. In this study, we apply 4-bit Group Scaling Quantization (GSQ) and Generative Pretrained Transformer Quantization (GPTQ) to LLaMA 1B, Qwen 0.5B, and PHI 1.5B, evaluating their impact across multiple NLP tasks. We benchmark these models on MS MARCO (Information Retrieval), BoolQ (Boolean Question Answering), and GSM8K (Mathematical Reasoning) datasets, assessing both accuracy and efficiency across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable decisions based on the specifications that need to be met. We discuss the pros and cons of GSQ and GPTQ techniques on models of different sizes, which also serve as a benchmark for future experiments.

### SGSimEval: A Comprehensive Multifaceted and Similarity-Enhanced   Benchmark for Automatic Survey Generation Systems
**Authors**: Beichen Guo, Zhiyuan Wen, Yu Yang, Peng Gao, Ruosong Yang, Jiaxing Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:27:58Z

**Summary**: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations, including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

### Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and   Reasoning
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Zhenhao Li, Zishuo Ding

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:20:09Z

**Summary**: Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored.   In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.

### Personalized LLM for Generating Customized Responses to the Same Query   from Different Users
**Authors**: Hang Zeng, Chaoyue Niu, Fan Wu, Chengfei Lv, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:12:16Z

**Summary**: Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLMs, but overlooked the diversity of queriers. In this work, we propose a new form of querier-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different queriers. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-querier general encoder and a querier-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same querier, while pulling apart those of different queriers. To mitigate the impact of query diversity on querier-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on query similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. To address the lack of datasets designed for querier-aware personalization, we also build a multi-querier dataset from English and Chinese scripts, as well as WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 queriers and 12 responders. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our design significantly improves the quality of personalized response generation, achieving relative improvement of 8.4% to 48.7% in ROUGE-L scores and winning rates ranging from 54% to 82% compared with various baseline methods.

### Training-Free Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration
**Authors**: Tianyu Xie, Yuhang Wu, Yongdong Luo, Jiayi Ji, Xiawu Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:09:53Z

**Summary**: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes.

### MMESGBench: Pioneering Multimodal Understanding and Complex Reasoning   Benchmark for ESG Tasks
**Authors**: Lei Zhang, Xin Zhou, Chaoyue He, Di Wang, Yi Wu, Hong Xu, Wei Liu, Chunyan Miao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T08:08:00Z

**Summary**: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports are essential for evaluating sustainability practices, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting financial transparency. However, these documents are often lengthy, structurally diverse, and multimodal, comprising dense text, structured tables, complex figures, and layout-dependent semantics. Existing AI systems often struggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no dedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we introduce \textbf{MMESGBench}, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted to evaluate multimodal understanding and complex reasoning across structurally diverse and multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a human-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates candidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting rich textual, tabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an LLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of each QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop validation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure quality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs derived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types and three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as single-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained multimodal evidence. Initial experiments validate that multimodal and retrieval-augmented models substantially outperform text-only baselines, particularly on visually grounded and cross-page tasks. MMESGBench is publicly available as an open-source dataset at https://github.com/Zhanglei1103/MMESGBench.

### Dynamic Quality-Latency Aware Routing for LLM Inference in Wireless   Edge-Device Networks
**Authors**: Rui Bao, Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:55:05Z

**Summary**: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

### SafeConstellations: Steering LLM Safety to Reduce Over-Refusals Through   Task-Specific Trajectory
**Authors**: Utsav Maskey, Sumit Yadav, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:54:42Z

**Summary**: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

### CSGO: Generalized Optimization for Cold Start in Wireless Collaborative   Edge LLM Systems
**Authors**: Xuran Liu, Nan Xue, Rui Bao, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Xiaodong Xu, Shuguang Cui

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:49:22Z

**Summary**: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources. Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.

### AI in Mental Health: Emotional and Sentiment Analysis of Large Language   Models' Responses to Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Queries
**Authors**: Arya VarastehNezhad, Reza Tavasoli, Soroush Elyasi, MohammadHossein LotfiNia, Hamed Farbeh

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:47:10Z

**Summary**: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models (LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values. Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user experience and outcomes.

### ToxiFrench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Language Models via CoT   Fine-Tuning for French Toxicity Detection
**Authors**: Axel Delaval, Shujian Yang, Haicheng Wang, Han Qiu, Jialiang Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:40:41Z

**Summary**: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging. While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10% through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then, we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight: Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision, significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability, suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages and safety-critical classification tasks.

### Towards Consumer-Grade Cybersickness Prediction: Multi-Model Alignment   for Real-Time Vision-Only Inference
**Authors**: Yitong Zhu, Zhuowen Liang, Yiming Wu, Tangyao Li, Yuyang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:40:14Z

**Summary**: Cybersickness remains a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of immersive virtual reality (VR), particularly in consumer-grade environments. While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

**Authors**: Ruiyan Qi, Congding Wen, Weibo Zhou, Shangsong Liang, Lingbo Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:37:12Z

**Summary**: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free $\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert $\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales (32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness ($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional annotated benchmarks.

### Is General-Purpose AI Reasoning Sensitive to Data-Induced Cognitive   Biases? Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas
**Authors**: Francesco Sovrano, Gabriele Dominici, Rita Sevastjanova, Alessandra Stramiglio, Alberto Bacchelli

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:29:46Z

**Summary**: Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases?   To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions.   To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the embedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased reasoners.   We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning. All systems exhibit cognitive biases (ranging from 5.9% to 35% across types), with bias sensitivity increasing sharply with task complexity (up to 49%), highlighting critical risks in real-world software engineering deployments.

**Authors**: Matthew Lyle Olson, Musashi Hinck, Neale Ratzlaff, Changbai Li, Phillip Howard, Vasudev Lal, Shao-Yen Tseng

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:29:42Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

### UniTracker: Learning Universal Whole-Body Motion Tracker for Humanoid   Robots
**Authors**: Kangning Yin, Weishuai Zeng, Ke Fan, Zirui Wang, Qiang Zhang, Zheng Tian, Jingbo Wang, Jiangmiao Pang, Weinan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:28:28Z

**Summary**: Achieving expressive and generalizable whole-body motion control is essential for deploying humanoid robots in real-world environments. In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.

### Inference performance evaluation for LLMs on edge devices with a novel   benchmarking framework and metric
**Authors**: Hao Chen, Cong Tian, Zixuan He, Bin Yu, Yepang Liu, Jialun Cao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T07:08:46Z

**Summary**: With the significant success achieved by large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, edge computing-based LLM inference services for mobile and PC are in high demand for data privacy. However, different edge platforms have different hardware characteristics and the large demand for memory capacity and bandwidth makes it very challenging to deploy and benchmark LLMs on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking tool named ELIB (edge LLM inference benchmarking) to evaluate LLM inference performance of different edge platforms, and propose a novel metric named MBU to indicate the percentage of the theoretically efficient use of available memory bandwidth for a specific model running on edge hardware to optimize memory usage. We deploy ELIB on three edge platforms and benchmark using five quantized models to optimize MBU in combination with other metrics such as FLOPS, throughput, latency and accuracy. And we analyze the results to derive the key factors, constraints, unpredictability in optimizing MBU that can guide deploying LLMs on more edge platforms.

**Authors**: Mukund Choudhary, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Gaurja Aeron, Antara Raaghavi Bhattacharya, Dang Khoa Dang Dinh, Ikhlasul Akmal Hanif, Daria Kotova, Ekaterina Kochmar, Monojit Choudhury

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:53:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

### Group Fairness Meets the Black Box: Enabling Fair Algorithms on Closed   LLMs via Post-Processing
**Authors**: Ruicheng Xian, Yuxuan Wan, Han Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:50:29Z

**Summary**: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

### Hallucination in LLM-Based Code Generation: An Automotive Case Study
**Authors**: Marc Pavel, Nenad Petrovic, Lukasz Mazur, Vahid Zolfaghari, Fengjunjie Pan, Alois Knoll

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:46:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect, unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.

### A Computationally Efficient Maximum A Posteriori Sequence Estimation via   Stein Variational Inference
**Authors**: Min-Won Seo, Solmaz S. Kia

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:37:14Z

**Summary**: State estimation in robotic systems presents significant challenges, particularly due to the prevalence of multimodal posterior distributions in real-world scenarios. One effective strategy for handling such complexity is to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequences over a discretized or sampled state space, which enables a concise representation of the most likely state trajectory. However, this approach often incurs substantial computational costs, especially in high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a novel MAP sequence estimation method, \textsf{Stein-MAP-Seq}, which effectively addresses multimodality while substantially reducing computational and memory overhead. Our key contribution is a sequential variational inference framework that captures temporal dependencies in dynamical system models and integrates Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) into a Viterbi-style dynamic programming algorithm, enabling computationally efficient MAP sequence estimation. \textsf{Stein-MAP-Seq} achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$, where $M$ is the number of particles, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of conventional MAP sequence estimators, with $N \gg M$. Furthermore, the method inherits SVGD's parallelism, enabling efficient computation for real-time deployment on GPU-equipped autonomous systems. We validate the proposed method in various multimodal scenarios, including those arising from nonlinear dynamics with ambiguous observations, unknown data associations, and temporary unobservability, demonstrating substantial improvements in estimation accuracy and robustness to multimodality over existing approaches.

### Cross-Granularity Hypergraph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for   Multi-hop Question Answering
**Authors**: Changjian Wang, Weihong Deng, Weili Guan, Quan Lu, Ning Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:36:13Z

**Summary**: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a 6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

### PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D   Perception Tasks
**Authors**: Xinhao Wang, Zhiwei Lin, Zhongyu Xia, Yongtao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T06:20:09Z

**Summary**: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.

### TokenRec: Learning to Tokenize ID for LLM-based Generative   Recommendation
**Authors**: Haohao Qu, Wenqi Fan, Zihuai Zhao, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:34:06Z

**Summary**: There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.

### Compositional Zero-shot Learning via Progressive Language-based   Observations
**Authors**: Lin Li, Guikun Chen, Zhen Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:22:27Z

**Summary**: Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training. However, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing knowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two key factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the appearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with different objects (or states). For instance, the state "old" can signify a vintage design for a "car" or an advanced age for a "cat". In this paper, we argue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition categories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive Language-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better observation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of concepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further devise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing classifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2) PLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to craft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive ablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO compared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in compositional recognition.

### Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking for Safe Chain-of-Thought   Distillation
**Authors**: Ziyang Ma, Qingyue Yuan, Linhai Zhang, Deyu Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:10:11Z

**Summary**: Previous chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods primarily focused on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by utilizing high-quality rationales generated by powerful Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4). However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of SLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during the CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the neighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets, to exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC, AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing distillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the safe training epochs.

### ORFuzz: Fuzzing the "Other Side" of LLM Safety -- Testing Over-Refusal
**Authors**: Haonan Zhang, Dongxia Wang, Yi Liu, Kexin Chen, Jiashui Wang, Xinlei Ying, Long Liu, Wenhai Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:03:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability. Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate, suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets. ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and trustworthy LLM-based software systems.

### Bridging Context Gaps: Leveraging Coreference Resolution for Long   Contextual Understanding
**Authors**: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Jiannan Cao, Yanxin Shen, Tianyu Du, Sheng Cheng, Xun Wang, Jianwei Yin, Xuhong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T05:01:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing; however, they still face difficulties when tasked with understanding lengthy contexts and executing effective question answering. These challenges often arise due to the complexity and ambiguity present in longer texts. To enhance the performance of LLMs in such scenarios, we introduce the Long Question Coreference Adaptation (LQCA) method. This innovative framework focuses on coreference resolution tailored to long contexts, allowing the model to identify and manage references effectively. The LQCA method encompasses four key steps: resolving coreferences within sub-documents, computing the distances between mentions, defining a representative mention for coreference, and answering questions through mention replacement. By processing information systematically, the framework provides easier-to-handle partitions for LLMs, promoting better understanding. Experimental evaluations on a range of LLMs and datasets have yielded positive results, with a notable improvements on OpenAI-o1-mini and GPT-4o models, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging coreference resolution to bridge context gaps in question answering. Our code is public at https://github.com/OceannTwT/LQCA.

### Tool-Planner: Task Planning with Clusters across Multiple Tools
**Authors**: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Jiannan Cao, Yuwei Zhang, Xuhong Zhang, Sheng Cheng, Xun Wang, Jianwei Yin, Tianyu Du

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:55:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, enabling them to solve various complex problems. Recently, this ability has been applied to the paradigm of tool learning. Tool learning involves providing examples of tool usage and their corresponding functions, allowing LLMs to formulate plans and demonstrate the process of invoking and executing each tool. LLMs can address tasks that they cannot complete independently, thereby enhancing their potential across different tasks. However, this approach faces two key challenges. First, redundant error correction leads to unstable planning and long execution time. Additionally, designing a correct plan among multiple tools is also a challenge in tool learning. To address these issues, we propose Tool-Planner, a task-processing framework based on toolkits. Tool-Planner groups tools based on the API functions with the same function into a toolkit and allows LLMs to implement planning across the various toolkits. When a tool error occurs, the language model can reselect and adjust tools based on the toolkit. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates a high pass and win rate across different datasets and optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, showcasing the potential of our method.

### A CLIP-based Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) Framework for Pedestrian   Re-Identification in Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Jialin Li, Shuqi Wu, Ning Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:50:27Z

**Summary**: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

### Efficient Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge for CT Field of View   Extension
**Authors**: Zhenhao Li, Long Yang, Xiaojie Yin, Haijun Yu, Jiazhou Wang, Hongbin Han, Weigang Hu, Yixing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:41:05Z

**Summary**: Computed tomography (CT) is a cornerstone imaging modality for non-invasive, high-resolution visualization of internal anatomical structures. However, when the scanned object exceeds the scanner's field of view (FOV), projection data are truncated, resulting in incomplete reconstructions and pronounced artifacts near FOV boundaries. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle to recover accurate anatomy from such data, limiting clinical reliability. Deep learning approaches have been explored for FOV extension, with diffusion generative models representing the latest advances in image synthesis. Yet, conventional diffusion models are computationally demanding and slow at inference due to their iterative sampling process. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient CT FOV extension framework based on the image-to-image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) diffusion model. Unlike traditional diffusion models that synthesize images from pure Gaussian noise, I$^2$SB learns a direct stochastic mapping between paired limited-FOV and extended-FOV images. This direct correspondence yields a more interpretable and traceable generative process, enhancing anatomical consistency and structural fidelity in reconstructions. I$^2$SB achieves superior quantitative performance, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 49.8\,HU on simulated noisy data and 152.0HU on real data, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such as conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPM) and patch-based diffusion methods. Moreover, its one-step inference enables reconstruction in just 0.19s per 2D slice, representing over a 700-fold speedup compared to cDDPM (135s) and surpassing diffusionGAN (0.58s), the second fastest. This combination of accuracy and efficiency makes I$^2$SB highly suitable for real-time or clinical deployment.

**Authors**: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Ningjing Sang, Yafeng Yan, Xiaolan Ke, Zhiting Zheng, Shaobo Liu, Songhang Deng, Jiannan Cao, Le Dai, Xingzu Liu, Ruilin Nong, Weihao Liu

**Summary**: Large language models(LLMs) have shown its outperforming ability on various tasks and question answering. However, LLMs require substantial memory storage on low-resource devices. More critically, the computational speed on these devices is also severely limited. In this paper, we propose SPA(Side Plugin Adaption), a lightweight architecture for fast on-devices inference on the constraints of strict on-devices computation and memory constraints. Compared with other on-devices seq2seq generation, SPA could make a fast and stable inference on low-resource constraints, allowing it to obtain cost effiency. Our method establish an interaction between a pretrained LLMs on-cloud and additive parameters on-devices, which could provide the knowledge on both pretrained LLMs and featured personal feature. Further more, SPA provides a framework to keep feature-base parameters on low computational devices while leave the parameters containing general information on the high computational devices.

### ElasticMM: Efficient Multimodal LLMs Serving with Elastic Multimodal   Parallelism
**Authors**: Zedong Liu, Shenggan Cheng, Guangming Tan, Yang You, Dingwen Tao

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:27:30Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

### Quantifying the Value of Seismic Structural Health Monitoring for   post-earthquake recovery of electric power system in terms of resilience   enhancement
**Authors**: Huangbin Liang, Beatriz Moya, Francisco Chinesta, Eleni Chatzi

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:13:31Z

**Summary**: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical infrastructure.

### UAV-VL-R1: Generalizing Vision-Language Models via Supervised   Fine-Tuning and Multi-Stage GRPO for UAV Visual Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiajin Guan, Haibo Mei, Bonan Zhang, Dan Liu, Yuanshuang Fu, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T04:06:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

### E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and   Efficiency
**Authors**: Dongjie Xu, Yue Cui, Weijie Shi, Qingzhi Ma, Hanghui Guo, Jiaming Li, Yao Zhao, Ruiyuan Zhang, Shimin Di, Jia Zhu, Kai Zheng, Jiajie Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T03:52:09Z

**Summary**: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this potential, directly applying LLMs often results in performance regressions or non-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks, equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Across multiple SQL benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that E3-Rewrite can shorten query execution time by as much as 25.6% relative to leading baselines, while also producing up to 24.4% more rewrites that meet strict equivalence criteria. These gains extend to challenging query patterns that prior approaches could not effectively optimize.

**Authors**: Chenyang Le, Yinfeng Xia, Huiyan Li, Manhong Wang, Yutao Sun, Xingyang Ma, Yanmin Qian

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T03:46:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance, particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation. Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

### Personalized Distractor Generation via MCTS-Guided Reasoning   Reconstruction
**Authors**: Tao Wu, Jingyuan Chen, Wang Lin, Jian Zhan, Mengze Li, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T03:20:37Z

**Summary**: Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

### PilotRL: Training Language Model Agents via Global Planning-Guided   Progressive Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Keer Lu, Chong Chen, Bin Cui, Huang Leng, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-15T03:07:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.
