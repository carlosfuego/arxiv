**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:58:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### TurboAttention: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs   LLMs
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:37:07Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

**Authors**: Sergey Zinchenko, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:49:32Z

**Summary**: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.

### CSR:Achieving 1 Bit Key-Value Cache via Sparse Representation
**Authors**: Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:01:53Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

### AsymRnR: Video Diffusion Transformers Acceleration with Asymmetric   Reduction and Restoration
**Authors**: Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Zhao Jin, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:28:22Z

**Summary**: Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.

### Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite   Pixel Learning
**Authors**: Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:55:26Z

**Summary**: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

### PULSE: Accelerating Distributed Pointer-Traversals on Disaggregated   Memory (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yupeng Tang, Seung-seob Lee, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Anurag Khandelwal

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T03:29:54Z

**Summary**: Caches at CPU nodes in disaggregated memory architectures amortize the high data access latency over the network. However, such caches are fundamentally unable to improve performance for workloads requiring pointer traversals across linked data structures. We argue for accelerating these pointer traversals closer to disaggregated memory in a manner that preserves expressiveness for supporting various linked structures, ensures energy efficiency and performance, and supports distributed execution. We design PULSE, a distributed pointer-traversal framework for rack-scale disaggregated memory to meet all the above requirements. Our evaluation of PULSE shows that it enables low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient execution for a wide range of pointer traversal workloads on disaggregated memory that fare poorly with caching alone.

### SparseMap: Loop Mapping for Sparse CNNs on Streaming Coarse-grained   Reconfigurable Array
**Authors**: Xiaobing Ni, Mengke Ge, Jiaheng Ruan, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T02:30:09Z

**Summary**: Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising architecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its fexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when accelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs would cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal dependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the streaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming CGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with operation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby ensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show SparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even smaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.

### RMCSA Algorithm for Congestion-Aware and Service Latency Aware Dynamic   Service Provisioning in Software-Defined SDM-EONs
**Authors**: Baljinder Singh Heera, Shrinivas Petale, Yatindra Nath Singh, Suresh Subramaniam

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T05:20:50Z

**Summary**: The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the utilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit minimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in optical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic and congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads to service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network, restricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available algorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer a trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus increasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic routing-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum assignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on real-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion under dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the formation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness centrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network topologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant RMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's K-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection blocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the route-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to the recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA algorithm.

### SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods
**Authors**: Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Chengruidong Zhang, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Jianfeng Gao, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Yuyang Huang, Jiayi Yao, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Hanchen Li, Yihua Cheng, Junchen Jiang, Shan Lu, Madan Musuvathi, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:53:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.   Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:37:48Z

**Summary**: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models. Codes and pre-trained models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T16:13:39Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:11:42Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

### Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority   Queues
**Authors**: Thore Thießen, Jan Vahrenhold

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:08:55Z

**Summary**: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

**Authors**: Md Nurul Absur, Sourya Saha, Sifat Nawrin Nova, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Md Rahat Ul Nasib

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T17:20:26Z

**Summary**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

### Unifying AI Tutor Evaluation: An Evaluation Taxonomy for Pedagogical   Ability Assessment of LLM-Powered AI Tutors
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T16:24:35Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T15:39:48Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richtárik

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T14:43:48Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

### PowerInfer-2: Fast Large Language Model Inference on a Smartphone
**Authors**: Zhenliang Xue, Yixin Song, Zeyu Mi, Xinrui Zheng, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T12:24:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

### HEXA-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware MoE Acceleration with ZERO   Computation Redundancy
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T12:03:19Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

**Summary**: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

**Authors**: Yuexin Li, Hiok Kuek Tan, Qiaoran Meng, Mei Lin Lock, Tri Cao, Shumin Deng, Nay Oo, Hoon Wei Lim, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T08:33:39Z

**Summary**: Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) achieve high precision by analyzing brand-domain consistency, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

### ZigZagkv: Dynamic KV Cache Compression for Long-context Modeling based   on Layer Uncertainty
**Authors**: Meizhi Zhong, Xikai Liu, Chen Zhang, Yikun Lei, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T07:52:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.

### Forecasting GPU Performance for Deep Learning Training and Inference
**Authors**: Seonho Lee, Amar Phanishayee, Divya Mahajan

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T03:21:13Z

**Summary**: Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

### Lexico: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Sparse Coding over Universal   Dictionaries
**Authors**: Junhyuck Kim, Jongho Park, Jaewoong Cho, Dimitris Papailiopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T03:00:29Z

**Summary**: We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T16:35:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

### Pushing the Limits of In-Network Caching for Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Gyuyeong Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T12:03:40Z

**Summary**: We present OrbitCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, OrbitCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement an OrbitCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that OrbitCache can balance highly skewed workloads and is robust to various system conditions.

### TextRefiner: Internal Visual Feature as Efficient Refiner for   Vision-Language Models Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Jingjing Xie, Yuxin Zhang, Jun Peng, Zhaohong Huang, Liujuan Cao

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T08:07:12Z

**Summary**: Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed at https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner

### ContextModule: Improving Code Completion via Repository-level Contextual   Information
**Authors**: Zhanming Guan, Junlin Liu, Jierui Liu, Chao Peng, Dexin Liu, Ningyuan Sun, Bo Jiang, Wenchao Li, Jie Liu, Hang Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T03:15:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code completion tasks, where they assist developers by predicting and generating new code in real-time. However, existing LLM-based code completion systems primarily rely on the immediate context of the file being edited, often missing valuable repository-level information, user behaviour and edit history that could improve suggestion accuracy. Additionally, challenges such as efficiently retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories, incorporating user behavior, and balancing accuracy with low-latency requirements in production environments remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose ContextModule, a framework designed to enhance LLM-based code completion by retrieving and integrating three types of contextual information from the repository: user behavior-based code, similar code snippets, and critical symbol definitions. By capturing user interactions across files and leveraging repository-wide static analysis, ContextModule improves the relevance and precision of generated code. We implement performance optimizations, such as index caching, to ensure the system meets the latency constraints of real-world coding environments. Experimental results and industrial practise demonstrate that ContextModule significantly improves code completion accuracy and user acceptance rates.

### Just Shift It: Test-Time Prototype Shifting for Zero-Shot Generalization   with Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Elaine Sui, Xiaohan Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T22:53:16Z

**Summary**: Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.

### From Slow Bidirectional to Fast Causal Video Generators
**Authors**: Tianwei Yin, Qiang Zhang, Richard Zhang, William T. Freeman, Fredo Durand, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to a causal transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model supports fast streaming generation of high quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

### FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware
**Authors**: Korbinian Pöppel, Maximilian Beck, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:50:37Z

**Summary**: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}

### ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion   Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Yuxuan Song, Yufei Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei-Ying Ma, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:13:20Z

**Summary**: The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has necessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.

### Video-XL: Extra-Long Vision Language Model for Hour-Scale Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Yan Shu, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Minghao Qin, Junjie Zhou, Zhengyang Liang, Tiejun Huang, Bo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T12:45:31Z

**Summary**: Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Caching at Network Edge: Classification,   Solutions, and Challenges
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Shazia Riaz, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:39:15Z

**Summary**: Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

### XKV: Personalized KV Cache Memory Reduction for Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Weizhuo Li, Zhigang Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T11:32:08Z

**Summary**: Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.

### Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shanti Stewart, Gouthaman KV, Lie Lu, Andrea Fanelli

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T06:37:27Z

**Summary**: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

### Ultrafast lattice and electron dynamics induced in a PbSe crystal by an   intense terahertz pulse
**Authors**: A. A. Melnikov, Yu. G. Selivanov, D. G. Poydashev, S. V. Chekalin

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T17:22:14Z

**Summary**: We have studied the ultrafast optical response of a PbSe crystal to an intense picosecond terahertz pulse with a peak electric field strength of up to $\sim$ 500 kV/cm. The reflectivity anisotropy signal contains oscillations at the fundamental frequency of the resonant infrared-active phonon mode as well as its second, third, and fourth harmonics. The effect is ascribed to coherent anharmonic phonons resonantly excited by the strong terahertz field. Pump terahertz pulses also induce an almost instantaneous Kerr effect and a long-lived optical anisotropy of the crystal with a characteristic decay time of $\gtrsim$ 100 ps. We consider lattice distortion and phonon-assisted side valley population as possible origins of this metastable state.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T16:41:54Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

### DHA: Learning Decoupled-Head Attention from Transformer Checkpoints via   Adaptive Heads Fusion
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Linhao Zhang, Junyuan Shang, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T13:23:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.

### PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following   Models Need for Efficient Generation
**Authors**: Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T13:23:39Z

**Summary**: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T04:08:56Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### Effect of electric field on excitons in wide quantum wells
**Authors**: Shiming Zheng, E. S. Khramtsov, I. V. Ignatiev

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T19:35:52Z

**Summary**: A microscopic model of a heterostructure with a quantum well (QW) is proposed to study the exciton behavior in an external electric field. The effect of an electric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW structure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths up to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is numerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and energies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are calculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the radiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric fields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW is also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of the center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs. Finally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the GaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and radiative broadenings of excitons.

### MC3: Memory Contention based Covert Channel Communication on Shared DRAM   System-on-Chips
**Authors**: Ismet Dagli, James Crea, Soner Seckiner, Yuanchao Xu, Selçuk Köse, Mehmet E. Belviranli

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:58:57Z

**Summary**: Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

### SwiftDiffusion: Efficient Diffusion Model Serving with Add-on Modules
**Authors**: Suyi Li, Lingyun Yang, Xiaoxiao Jiang, Hanfeng Lu, Dakai An, Zhipeng Di, Weiyi Lu, Jiawei Chen, Kan Liu, Yinghao Yu, Tao Lan, Guodong Yang, Lin Qu, Liping Zhang, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:47:06Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.

### Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free   Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern
**Authors**: Hongyin Tang, Di Xiu, Lanrui Wang, Xiurui Geng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:46:06Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

### One-Hop Sub-Query Result Caches for Graph Database Systems
**Authors**: Hieu Nguyen, Jun Li, Shahram Ghandeharizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:20:47Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing graph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop navigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with selection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies a unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable vertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its sequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the cache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates the requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the cache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation of read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and write transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either deletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph query processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the cache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write graph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache. Obtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query response times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query re-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An interesting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the indirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference one-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their processing significantly.

### Cross-Self KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language Inference
**Authors**: Xiaohuan Pei, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:47:17Z

**Summary**: KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

### Neural Two-Level Monte Carlo Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Mikhail Dereviannykh, Dmitrii Klepikov, Johannes Hanika, Carsten Dachsbacher

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:06:23Z

**Summary**: We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Ji Qi, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T18:58:03Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T14:56:56Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs. Our training, inference, and model implementations are open-sourced and can be found through https://huggingface.co/collections/Snowflake/swiftkv-models-674f7d7474eb789e185d31cb.

### KV Shifting Attention Enhances Language Modeling
**Authors**: Mingyu Xu, Wei Cheng, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T12:19:38Z

**Summary**: The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

### A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference   with Partial Contexts
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T06:52:42Z

**Summary**: Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T04:29:49Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### F2: Designing a Key-Value Store for Large Skewed Workloads
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellis, Badrish Chandramouli, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T01:50:27Z

**Summary**: Many real-world workloads present a challenging set of requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns for both reads and writes. We find that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency, sacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance, saturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory resources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs). Unfortunately these designs are not able to handle meet the challenging demands of such larger-than-memory, skewed workloads.   To this end, we present F2, a new key-value store that bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. F2 adopts a tiered, record-oriented architecture inspired by LSM-trees to effectively separate hot from cold records, while incorporating concurrent latch-free mechanisms from CPU-optimized engines to maximize performance on modern NVMe SSDs. To realize this design, we tackle key challenges and introduce several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction and user operations (e.g., RMWs), as well as new components: a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records and a read-cache for serving read-hot data.   Detailed experimental results show that F2 matches or outperforms existing solutions, achieving on average better throughput on memory-constrained environments compared to state-of-the-art systems like RocksDB (11.75x), SplinterDB (4.52x), KVell (10.56x), LeanStore (2.04x), and FASTER (2.38x). F2 also maintains its high performance across varying workload skewness levels and memory budgets, while achieving low disk write amplification.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T18:40:24Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### Measurement of electron beam induced sample heating in SEM experiments
**Authors**: Christina Koenig, Alice Bastos da Silva Fanta, Joerg R. Jinschek

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T14:47:42Z

**Summary**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.

### ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable   Compression
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T10:58:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

### Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T08:51:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but incur high serving costs due to substantial memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression methods, including quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform treatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache compression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising accuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores keys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on attention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory based on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV compression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to enable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To efficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations including unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on vLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\times$ to $5.0\times$ without accuracy loss and up to $11.0\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing throughput by $1.9\times$ to $2.5\times$, and up to $6.9\times$.

### PASCAL: A Learning-aided Cooperative Bandwidth Control Policy for   Hierarchical Storage Systems
**Authors**: Xijun Li, Yunfan Zhou, Ji Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T05:32:12Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, the Hierarchical Storage System (HSS) is considered as an ideal model to meet the cost-performance demand. The data migration between storing tiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth control is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous research about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of bandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking optimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the system performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control in HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to formalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a learning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \Pascal{}, which learns to control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative way. We implement \Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three strong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical system shows that \Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and greatly improve throughput stability (2X $\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.

**Authors**: Cebajel Tanan, Sameer G. Kulkarni, Tamal Das, Manjesh K. Hanawal

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T04:29:12Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information. In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence. Our tool is available at www.ipanalyzer.in

### cRVR: A Stackelberg Game Approach for Joint Privacy-Aware Video   Requesting and Edge Caching
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Linchang Xiao, Yipeng Zhou, Miao Hu, Di Wu, John C. S. Lui, Quan Z. Sheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T22:48:09Z

**Summary**: As users conveniently stream their favorite online videos, video request records are automatically stored by video content providers, which have a high chance of privacy leakage. Unfortunately, most existing privacy-enhancing approaches are not applicable for protecting user privacy in video requests, because they cannot be easily altered or distorted by users and must be visible for content providers to stream correct videos. To preserve request privacy in online video services, it is possible to request additional videos that are irrelevant to users' interests so that content providers cannot precisely infer users' interest information. However, a naive redundant requesting approach would significantly degrade the performance of edge caches and increase bandwidth overhead. In this paper, we are among the first to propose a Cache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices (UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which can effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal impact on the EC's performance. To tackle the problem, we first develop a Stackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC, and obtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility. For UDs, the utility function is a combination of both video playback utility and privacy protection utility. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Extensive experiments are conducted with real traces to demonstrate that cRVR can effectively protect video request privacy by reducing up to 59.03\% of privacy disclosure compared to baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, the caching performance of EC is only slightly affected.

### GoldFish: Serverless Actors with Short-Term Memory State for the   Edge-Cloud Continuum
**Authors**: Cynthia Marcelino, Jack Shahhoud, Stefan Nastic

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T22:02:42Z

**Summary**: Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services.   To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:12:09Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:36:19Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention concentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance representation across most layers.

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:29:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

**Authors**: Luyi Ma, Aashika Padmanabhan, Anjana Ganesh, Shengwei Tang, Jiao Chen, Xiaohan Li, Lalitesh Morishetti, Kaushiki Nag, Malay Patel, Jason Cho, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:20:40Z

**Summary**: Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T20:39:56Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders
**Authors**: Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T18:59:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

### Local and Regional Contributions to Tropospheric Ozone Concentrations
**Authors**: Callum E. Flowerday, Ryan Thalman, Jaron C. Hansen

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T16:10:26Z

**Summary**: The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.

### Real-time Transformer-based Open-Vocabulary Detection with Efficient   Fusion Head
**Authors**: Tiancheng Zhao, Peng Liu, Xuan He, Lu Zhang, Kyusong Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:24:20Z

**Summary**: End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

### Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware   Masking
**Authors**: Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:07:51Z

**Summary**: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.

### Memory-Efficient Training for Deep Speaker Embedding Learning in Speaker   Verification
**Authors**: Bei Liu, Yanmin Qian

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:57:46Z

**Summary**: Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.

### JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Zemin Sun, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:30:04Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

### Optimal Power Allocation in Uplink NOMA with Simultaneous Cache-Enabled   D2D Communications
**Authors**: Aditya Powari, Daniel K. C. So

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T21:47:35Z

**Summary**: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T15:45:26Z

**Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

### SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding for Interactive LLM   Inference on Consumer Devices
**Authors**: Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin

**Updated**: 2024-11-30T21:33:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

**Authors**: Thijs Steel, Julien Langou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:21:12Z

**Summary**: We present an efficient algorithm for the application of sequences of planar rotations to a matrix. Applying such sequences efficiently is important in many numerical linear algebra algorithms for eigenvalues. Our algorithm is novel in three main ways. First, we introduce a new kernel that is optimized for register reuse in a novel way. Second, we introduce a blocking and packing scheme that improves the cache efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we thoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to important theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware.

### DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and   Verifiable Credentials
**Authors**: Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Dennis Natusch, Artur Philipp, Axel Küpper, Hans Joachim Einsiedler, Daniela Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix   Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching
**Authors**: Zhen Zheng, Xin Ji, Taosong Fang, Fanghao Zhou, Chuanjie Liu, Gang Peng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:57:37Z

**Summary**: Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.

### Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching
**Authors**: Xiaofan Niu, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:35:22Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

### Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:42:54Z

**Summary**: We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T12:50:05Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### Many Hands Make Light Work: Accelerating Edge Inference via Multi-Client   Collaborative Caching
**Authors**: Wenyi Liang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Chunming Qiao, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T10:40:47Z

**Summary**: Edge inference is a technology that enables real-time data processing and analysis on clients near the data source. To ensure compliance with the Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), such as a 30% latency reduction target, caching is usually adopted to reduce redundant computations in inference tasks on stream data. Due to task and data correlations, sharing cache information among clients can improve the inference performance. However, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data across different clients and the long-tail distributions, where some classes have significantly more samples than others, will reduce cache hit ratios and increase latency. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an efficient inference framework, CoCa, which leverages a multi-client collaborative caching mechanism to accelerate edge inference. On the client side, the model is pre-set with multiple cache layers to achieve a quick inference. During inference, the model performs sequential lookups at cache layers activated by the edge server. On the server side, CoCa uses a two-dimensional global cache to periodically aggregate information from clients, mitigating the effects of non-IID data. For client cache allocation, CoCa first evaluates the importance of classes based on how frequently and recently their samples have been accessed. CoCa then selects frequently recurring classes to address long-tail distribution challenges. Finally, CoCa dynamically activates cache layers to balance lookup overhead and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCa reduces inference latency by 23.0% to 45.2% on the VGG, ResNet and AST models with a slight loss of accuracy.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T02:01:50Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:59:48Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

### cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines
**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### FastSwitch: Optimizing Context Switching Efficiency in Fairness-aware   Large Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Ao Shen, Zhiyao Li, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T15:07:28Z

**Summary**: Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

### Accelerating Vision Diffusion Transformers with Skip Branches
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T14:43:46Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.git.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T08:21:47Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### A Method for Building Large Language Models with Predefined KV Cache   Capacity
**Authors**: Zhonghua Yi, Ge Niu, Lei Wang, Wei Tang, Liqiu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T03:07:20Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

### Attamba: Attending To Multi-Token States
**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Safeen Huda, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:52:06Z

**Summary**: When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

### STAR: Synthesis of Tailored Architectures
**Authors**: Armin W. Thomas, Rom Parnichkun, Alexander Amini, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:42:42Z

**Summary**: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

**Summary**: Air quality is a prevalent concern due to its imposing health risks. The state of Utah, USA, has, at times over the last 20 years, experienced some of the worst air quality in the nation. The propensity for Utah to experience elevated concentrations of particulate matter ($\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$) and ozone ($\mathrm{O_3}$) can, in part, be attributed to its unique geography, which features dry, mountainous terrain. Valleys in Utah create ideal environments for extended cold-pool events. In this review, we summarize air quality research conducted in Utah over the past 20 years (2002-2022) by dividing the state into six regions: Utah Valley, Summit County, Southern Utah (regions south of Utah Valley), Cache Valley, Uinta Basin, and Salt Lake Valley. We review the published literature chronologically and provide a summary for each region, identifying areas where additional research is warranted. We found that research efforts are heavily weighted toward the Uinta Basin and Salt Lake Valley, with the remaining regions collectively accounting for only 20% of studies. We identified the need for more source apportionment studies, speciated volatile organic compound (VOC) analyses, and ozone isopleths. Where ozone isopleths cannot be created, measurements of glyoxal ($\mathrm{CHOCHO}$) and formaldehyde ($\mathrm{HCHO}$) concentrations could serve as cost-effective surrogates to inform ozone mitigation policies.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T17:28:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

 ### PanSplat: 4K Panorama Synthesis with Feed-Forward Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Cheng Zhang, Haofei Xu, Qianyi Wu, Camilo Cruz Gambardella, Dinh Phung, Jianfei Cai

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:59:45Z

**Summary**: With the advent of portable 360{\deg} cameras, panorama has gained significant attention in applications like virtual reality (VR), virtual tours, robotics, and autonomous driving. As a result, wide-baseline panorama view synthesis has emerged as a vital task, where high resolution, fast inference, and memory efficiency are essential. Nevertheless, existing methods are typically constrained to lower resolutions (512 $\times$ 1024) due to demanding memory and computational requirements. In this paper, we present PanSplat, a generalizable, feed-forward approach that efficiently supports resolution up to 4K (2048 $\times$ 4096). Our approach features a tailored spherical 3D Gaussian pyramid with a Fibonacci lattice arrangement, enhancing image quality while reducing information redundancy. To accommodate the demands of high resolution, we propose a pipeline that integrates a hierarchical spherical cost volume and Gaussian heads with local operations, enabling two-step deferred backpropagation for memory-efficient training on a single A100 GPU. Experiments demonstrate that PanSplat achieves state-of-the-art results with superior efficiency and image quality across both synthetic and real-world datasets. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/chengzhag/PanSplat}.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:58:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### Making FETCH! Happen: Finding Emergent Dog Whistles Through Common   Habitats
**Authors**: Kuleen Sasse, Carlos Aguirre, Isabel Cachola, Sharon Levy, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:46:12Z

**Summary**: WARNING: This paper contains content that maybe upsetting or offensive to some readers. Dog whistles are coded expressions with dual meanings: one intended for the general public (outgroup) and another that conveys a specific message to an intended audience (ingroup). Often, these expressions are used to convey controversial political opinions while maintaining plausible deniability and slip by content moderation filters. Identification of dog whistles relies on curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce \textbf{FETCH!}, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora. We find that state-of-the-art systems fail to achieve meaningful results across three distinct social media case studies. We present \textbf{EarShot}, a novel system that combines the strengths of vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently and effectively identify new dog whistles.

### Toward Adaptive Large Language Models Structured Pruning via   Hybrid-grained Weight Importance Assessment
**Authors**: Jun Liu, Zhenglun Kong, Pu Zhao, Changdi Yang, Hao Tang, Xuan Shen, Geng Yuan, Wei Niu, Wenbin Zhang, Xue Lin, Dong Huang, Yanzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:31:27Z

**Summary**: Structured pruning for large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant academic interest due to its ability to efficiently compress and accelerate LLMs by eliminating redundant weight groups at a coarse-grained granularity. Current structured pruning methods for LLMs typically depend on a singular granularity for assessing weight importance, resulting in notable performance degradation in downstream tasks. Intriguingly, our empirical investigations reveal that utilizing unstructured pruning, which achieves better performance retention by pruning weights at a finer granularity, \emph{i.e.}, individual weights, yields significantly varied sparse LLM structures when juxtaposed to structured pruning. This suggests that evaluating both holistic and individual assessment for weight importance is essential for LLM pruning. Building on this insight, we introduce the Hybrid-grained Weight Importance Assessment (HyWIA), a novel method that merges fine-grained and coarse-grained evaluations of weight importance for the pruning of LLMs. Leveraging an attention mechanism, HyWIA adaptively determines the optimal blend of granularity in weight importance assessments in an end-to-end pruning manner. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, Baichuan, and Bloom across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HyWIA in pruning LLMs. For example, HyWIA surpasses the cutting-edge LLM-Pruner by an average margin of 2.82\% in accuracy across seven downstream tasks when pruning LLaMA-7B by 50\%.

### Differentially Private Prototypes for Imbalanced Transfer Learning
**Authors**: Dariush Wahdany, Matthew Jagielski, Adam Dziedzic, Franziska Boenisch

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:28:19Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) models have been shown to leak private information from their training datasets. Differential Privacy (DP), typically implemented through the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm (DP-SGD), has become the standard solution to bound leakage from the models. Despite recent improvements, DP-SGD-based approaches for private learning still usually struggle in the high privacy ($\varepsilon\le1)$ and low data regimes, and when the private training datasets are imbalanced. To overcome these limitations, we propose Differentially Private Prototype Learning (DPPL) as a new paradigm for private transfer learning. DPPL leverages publicly pre-trained encoders to extract features from private data and generates DP prototypes that represent each private class in the embedding space and can be publicly released for inference. Since our DP prototypes can be obtained from only a few private training data points and without iterative noise addition, they offer high-utility predictions and strong privacy guarantees even under the notion of \textit{pure DP}. We additionally show that privacy-utility trade-offs can be further improved when leveraging the public data beyond pre-training of the encoder: in particular, we can privately sample our DP prototypes from the publicly available data points used to train the encoder. Our experimental evaluation with four state-of-the-art encoders, four vision datasets, and under different data and imbalancedness regimes demonstrate DPPL's high performance under strong privacy guarantees in challenging private learning setups

### MGH Radiology Llama: A Llama 3 70B Model for Radiology
**Authors**: Yucheng Shi, Peng Shu, Zhengliang Liu, Zihao Wu, Quanzheng Li, Tianming Liu, Ninghao Liu, Xiang Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:25:26Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the field of radiology has increasingly harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and improve patient care. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as particularly promising tools, offering significant potential in assisting radiologists with report generation, clinical decision support, and patient communication. This paper presents an advanced radiology-focused large language model: MGH Radiology Llama. It is developed using the Llama 3 70B model, building upon previous domain-specific models like Radiology-GPT and Radiology-Llama2. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital, comprising over 6.5 million de-identified medical reports across various imaging modalities, the model demonstrates significant improvements in generating accurate and clinically relevant radiology impressions given the corresponding findings. Our evaluation, incorporating both traditional metrics and a GPT-4-based assessment, highlights the enhanced performance of this work over general-purpose LLMs.

### EOV-Seg: Efficient Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation
**Authors**: Hongwei Niu, Jie Hu, Jianghang Lin, Guannan Jiang, Shengchuan Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:16:14Z

**Summary**: Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation aims to segment and classify everything in diverse scenes across an unbounded vocabulary. Existing methods typically employ two-stage or single-stage framework. The two-stage framework involves cropping the image multiple times using masks generated by a mask generator, followed by feature extraction, while the single-stage framework relies on a heavyweight mask decoder to make up for the lack of spatial position information through self-attention and cross-attention in multiple stacked Transformer blocks. Both methods incur substantial computational overhead, thereby hindering the efficiency of model inference. To fill the gap in efficiency, we propose EOV-Seg, a novel single-stage, shared, efficient, and spatialaware framework designed for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Specifically, EOV-Seg innovates in two aspects. First, a Vocabulary-Aware Selection (VAS) module is proposed to improve the semantic comprehension of visual aggregated features and alleviate the feature interaction burden on the mask decoder. Second, we introduce a Two-way Dynamic Embedding Experts (TDEE), which efficiently utilizes the spatial awareness capabilities of ViT-based CLIP backbone. To the best of our knowledge, EOV-Seg is the first open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation framework towards efficiency, which runs faster and achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, with COCO training only, EOV-Seg achieves 24.5 PQ, 32.1 mIoU, and 11.6 FPS on the ADE20K dataset and the inference time of EOV-Seg is 4-19 times faster than state-of-theart methods. Especially, equipped with ResNet50 backbone, EOV-Seg runs 23.8 FPS with only 71M parameters on a single RTX 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/nhw649/EOV-Seg.

### Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability   Detection
**Authors**: Ira Ceka, Feitong Qiao, Anik Dey, Aastha Valechia, Gail Kaiser, Baishakhi Ray

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:08:14Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.

### LLMs for Cold-Start Cutting Plane Separator Configuration
**Authors**: Connor Lawless, Yingxi Li, Anders Wikum, Madeleine Udell, Ellen Vitercik

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:03:57Z

**Summary**: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers ship with a staggering number of parameters that are challenging to select a priori for all but expert optimization users, but can have an outsized impact on the performance of the MILP solver. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches to configure solvers require training ML models by solving thousands of related MILP instances, generalize poorly to new problem sizes, and often require implementing complex ML pipelines and custom solver interfaces that can be difficult to integrate into existing optimization workflows. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM-based framework to configure which cutting plane separators to use for a given MILP problem with little to no training data based on characteristics of the instance, such as a natural language description of the problem and the associated LaTeX formulation. We augment these LLMs with descriptions of cutting plane separators available in a given solver, grounded by summarizing the existing research literature on separators. While individual solver configurations have a large variance in performance, we present a novel ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates configurations to create a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our LLM-based methodology requires no custom solver interface, can find a high-performing configuration by solving only a small number of MILPs, and can generate the configuration with simple API calls that run in under a second. Numerical results show our approach is competitive with existing configuration approaches on a suite of classic combinatorial optimization problems and real-world datasets with only a fraction of the training data and computation time.

### SpeechPrune: Context-aware Token Pruning for Speech Information   Retrieval
**Authors**: Yueqian Lin, Yuzhe Fu, Jingyang Zhang, Yudong Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Jingwei Sun, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:36:02Z

**Summary**: We introduce Speech Information Retrieval (SIR), a new long-context task for Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs), and present SPIRAL, a 1,012-sample benchmark testing models' ability to extract critical details from approximately 90-second spoken inputs. While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%. This approach highlights the potential of token-level pruning for efficient and scalable long-form speech understanding.

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:34:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern. With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end, we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate 10 S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when scoring holistically the toxicity of a prompt; and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microaggressions, bias). We release this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.

### The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs)
**Authors**: Jiya Manchanda, Laura Boettcher, Matheus Westphalen, Jasser Jasser

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:32:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their "black box" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.

### LLM-RG4: Flexible and Factual Radiology Report Generation across Diverse   Input Contexts
**Authors**: Zhuhao Wang, Yihua Sun, Zihan Li, Xuan Yang, Fang Chen, Hongen Liao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:29:51Z

**Summary**: Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where radiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical demands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are constrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding'' section from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and outputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could generate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between current RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a data generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers four common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded input and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based RRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible instruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further develop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle diverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the additional computational burden associated with increased input volumes. Besides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's attention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical efficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal input-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly suffer from this problem.

### Combining Large Language Models with Tutoring System Intelligence: A   Case Study in Caregiver Homework Support
**Authors**: Devika Venugopalan, Ziwen Yan, Conrad Borchers, Jionghao Lin, Vincent Aleven

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:22:40Z

**Summary**: Caregivers (i.e., parents and members of a child's caring community) are underappreciated stakeholders in learning analytics. Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula. An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support. Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them. Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning. We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM. This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat. Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation. We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems.

**Authors**: Jian Yang, Jiajun Zhang, Jiaxi Yang, Ke Jin, Lei Zhang, Qiyao Peng, Ken Deng, Yibo Miao, Tianyu Liu, Zeyu Cui, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:14:35Z

**Summary**: Code completion has become an essential tool for daily software development. Existing evaluation benchmarks often employ static methods that do not fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world coding environments and face significant challenges, including limited context length, reliance on superficial evaluation metrics, and potential overfitting to training datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing code completion in software development through the creation of a repository-level benchmark ExecRepoBench and the instruction corpora Repo-Instruct, aim at improving the functionality of open-source large language models (LLMs) in real-world coding scenarios that involve complex interdependencies across multiple files. ExecRepoBench includes 1.2K samples from active Python repositories. Plus, we present a multi-level grammar-based completion methodology conditioned on the abstract syntax tree to mask code fragments at various logical units (e.g. statements, expressions, and functions). Then, we fine-tune the open-source LLM with 7B parameters on Repo-Instruct to produce a strong code completion baseline model Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C based on the open-source model. Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C is rigorously evaluated against existing benchmarks, including MultiPL-E and ExecRepoBench, which consistently outperforms prior baselines across all programming languages. The deployment of \ourmethod{} can be used as a high-performance, local service for programming development\footnote{\url{https://execrepobench.github.io/}}.

### SciFaultyQA: Benchmarking LLMs on Faulty Science Question Detection with   a GAN-Inspired Approach to Synthetic Dataset Generation
**Authors**: Debarshi Kundu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:11:48Z

**Summary**: Consider the problem: ``If one man and one woman can produce one child in one year, how many children will be produced by one woman and three men in 0.5 years?" Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer "0.5," which does not make sense. While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of "0.5 child." Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding. However, this is inconsistent.   These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty. We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid. By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions. We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.

### Cost-Effective Label-free Node Classification with LLMs
**Authors**: Taiyan Zhang, Renchi Yang, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan, Yurui Lai

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:04:40Z

**Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as go-to models for node classification in graph data due to their powerful abilities in fusing graph structures and attributes. However, such models strongly rely on adequate high-quality labeled data for training, which are expensive to acquire in practice. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), a promising way is to leverage their superb zero-shot capabilities and massive knowledge for node labeling. Despite promising results reported, this methodology either demands considerable queries to LLMs, or suffers from compromised performance caused by noisy labels produced by LLMs.   To remedy these issues, this work presents Cella, an active self-training framework that integrates LLMs into GNNs in a cost-effective manner. The design recipe of Cella is to iteratively identify small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extract informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Particularly, Cella includes three major components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a judicious sample selection scheme to sift out the "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module combining LLMs and GNNs with rewired topology. Our extensive experiments over five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Cella significantly outperforms the state of the arts under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. In particular, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Cella is able to achieve an 8.08% conspicuous improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.

### AlphaZero Neural Scaling and Zipf's Law: a Tale of Board Games and Power   Laws
**Authors**: Oren Neumann, Claudius Gros

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:59:55Z

**Summary**: Neural scaling laws are observed in a range of domains, to date with no clear understanding of why they occur. Recent theories suggest that loss power laws arise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural language. One theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when Zipf-distributed task quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In this paper we examine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using a theory of language-model scaling. We find that game states in training and inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from the tree structure of the environment, and examine the correlation between scaling-law and Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with quanta scaling theory, we find that agents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this order scales inversely with modelling complexity. We also find that inverse scaling, the failure of models to improve with size, is correlated with unusual Zipf curves where end-game states are among the most frequent states. We show evidence that larger models shift their focus to these less-important states, sacrificing their understanding of important early-game states.

### DARWIN 1.5: Large Language Models as Materials Science Adapted Learners
**Authors**: Tong Xie, Yuwei Wan, Yixuan Liu, Yuchen Zeng, Wenjie Zhang, Chunyu Kit, Dongzhan Zhou, Bram Hoex

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:51:27Z

**Summary**: Materials discovery and design aim to find components and structures with desirable properties over highly complex and diverse search spaces. Traditional solutions, such as high-throughput simulations and machine learning (ML), often rely on complex descriptors, which hinder generalizability and transferability across tasks. Moreover, these descriptors may deviate from experimental data due to inevitable defects and purity issues in the real world, which may reduce their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose Darwin 1.5, an open-source large language model (LLM) tailored for materials science. By leveraging natural language as input, Darwin eliminates the need for task-specific descriptors and enables a flexible, unified approach to material property prediction and discovery. We employ a two-stage training strategy combining question-answering (QA) fine-tuning with multi-task learning (MTL) to inject domain-specific knowledge in various modalities and facilitate cross-task knowledge transfer. Through our strategic approach, we achieved a significant enhancement in the prediction accuracy of LLMs, with a maximum improvement of 60\% compared to LLaMA-7B base models. It further outperforms traditional machine learning models on various tasks in material science, showcasing the potential of LLMs to provide a more versatile and scalable foundation model for materials discovery and design.

### Inferring Functionality of Attention Heads from their Parameters
**Authors**: Amit Elhelo, Mor Geva

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:45:33Z

**Summary**: Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations.

### BetaExplainer: A Probabilistic Method to Explain Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Whitney Sloneker, Shalin Patel, Michael Wang, Lorin Crawford, Ritambhara Singh

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:45:26Z

**Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for conducting inference on graph data but are often seen as "black boxes" due to difficulty in extracting meaningful subnetworks driving predictive performance. Many interpretable GNN methods exist, but they cannot quantify uncertainty in edge weights and suffer in predictive accuracy when applied to challenging graph structures. In this work, we proposed BetaExplainer which addresses these issues by using a sparsity-inducing prior to mask unimportant edges during model training. To evaluate our approach, we examine various simulated data sets with diverse real-world characteristics. Not only does this implementation provide a notion of edge importance uncertainty, it also improves upon evaluation metrics for challenging datasets compared to state-of-the art explainer methods.

### When Backdoors Speak: Understanding LLM Backdoor Attacks Through   Model-Generated Explanations
**Authors**: Huaizhi Ge, Yiming Li, Qifan Wang, Yongfeng Zhang, Ruixiang Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:44:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers embedded in poisoned samples can maliciously alter LLMs' behaviors. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.

### Merging White Dwarf Binaries Produce Type Ia Supernovae in Elliptical   Galaxies
**Authors**: Michael A. Tucker

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:44:34Z

**Summary**: I find that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with bimodal nebular emission profiles occur almost exclusively in massive ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11}~M_\odot$) galaxies with low star-formation rates (SFR~$\lesssim 0.5~M_\odot$/yr). The bimodal profiles are likely produced by two white dwarfs that exploded during a merger or collision, supported by a correlation between the peak-to-peak velocity separation ($v_{\rm sep}$) and the SN Ia peak luminosity ($M_V$) which arises naturally from more massive white dwarf binaries synthesizing more $^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The quiescent hosts are consistent with the long delay times required to form double white dwarf binaries. The distributions of SNe Ia with and without bimodal nebular lines differ in host mass, SFR, and specific SFR with K-S test probabilities of $3.1\%$, $0.03\%$, and $0.02\%$, respectively. Viewing angle effects can fully explain the SNe Ia in quiescent hosts without bimodal emission profiles and the dearth of merger/collision driven SNe Ia in star-forming hosts requires at least two distinct progenitor channels for normal SNe Ia. $30-40\%$ of all SNe Ia originate from mergers or collisions depending on how cleanly host environment distinguishes progenitor scenarios. The bimodal SNe Ia share some characteristics with the underluminous 91bg-like SNe Ia that also prefer older populations, but there is no unambiguous connection between the two classifications. This may suggest separate processes or multiple axes of ejecta (a)symmetry. Existing models for WD mergers and collisions broadly reproduce the $v_{\rm sep} - M_V$ correlation and future analyses may be able to infer the masses/mass-ratios of merging white dwarfs in external galaxies.

### Inference of entropy production for periodically driven systems
**Authors**: Pedro E. Harunari, Carlos E. Fiore, Andre C. Barato

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:39:11Z

**Summary**: The problem of estimating entropy production from incomplete information in stochastic thermodynamics is essential for theory and experiments. Whereas a considerable amount of work has been done on this topic, arguably, most of it is restricted to the case of nonequilibrium steady states driven by a fixed thermodynamic force. Based on a recent method that has been proposed for nonequilibrium steady states, we obtain an estimate of the entropy production based on the statistics of visible transitions and their waiting times for the case of periodically driven systems. The time-dependence of transition rates in periodically driven systems produces several differences in relation to steady states, which is reflected in the entropy production estimation. More specifically, we propose an estimate that does depend on the time between transitions but is independent of the specific time of the first transition, thus it does not require tracking the protocol. Formally, this elimination of the time-dependence of the first transition leads to an extra term in the inequality that involves the rate of entropy production and its estimate. We analyze a simple model of a molecular pump to understand the relation between the performance of the method and physical quantities such as energies, energy barriers, and thermodynamic affinity. Our results with this model indicate that the emergence of net motion in the form of a probability current in the space of states is a necessary condition for a relevant estimate of the rate of entropy production.

### TurboAttention: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs   LLMs
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:37:07Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

### The Impact of Generalization Techniques on the Interplay Among Privacy,   Utility, and Fairness in Image Classification
**Authors**: Ahmad Hassanpour, Amir Zarei, Khawla Mallat, Anderson Santana de Oliveira, Bian Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:35:31Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and utility in image classification using machine learning (ML). Recent research suggests that generalization techniques can improve the balance between privacy and utility. One focus of this work is sharpness-aware training (SAT) and its integration with differential privacy (DP-SAT) to further improve this balance. Additionally, we examine fairness in both private and non-private learning models trained on datasets with synthetic and real-world biases. We also measure the privacy risks involved in these scenarios by performing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and explore the consequences of eliminating high-privacy risk samples, termed outliers. Moreover, we introduce a new metric, named \emph{harmonic score}, which combines accuracy, privacy, and fairness into a single measure.   Through empirical analysis using generalization techniques, we achieve an accuracy of 81.11\% under $(8, 10^{-5})$-DP on CIFAR-10, surpassing the 79.5\% reported by De et al. (2022). Moreover, our experiments show that memorization of training samples can begin before the overfitting point, and generalization techniques do not guarantee the prevention of this memorization. Our analysis of synthetic biases shows that generalization techniques can amplify model bias in both private and non-private models. Additionally, our results indicate that increased bias in training data leads to reduced accuracy, greater vulnerability to privacy attacks, and higher model bias. We validate these findings with the CelebA dataset, demonstrating that similar trends persist with real-world attribute imbalances. Finally, our experiments show that removing outlier data decreases accuracy and further amplifies model bias.

### OpenReviewer: A Specialized Large Language Model for Generating Critical   Scientific Paper Reviews
**Authors**: Maximilian Idahl, Zahra Ahmadi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:31:00Z

**Summary**: We present OpenReviewer, an open-source system for generating high-quality peer reviews of machine learning and AI conference papers. At its core is Llama-OpenReviewer-8B, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top ML conferences. Given a PDF paper submission and review template as input, OpenReviewer extracts the full text, including technical content like equations and tables, and generates a structured review following conference-specific guidelines. Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer produces significantly more critical and realistic reviews compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5. While other LLMs tend toward overly positive assessments, OpenReviewer's recommendations closely match the distribution of human reviewer ratings. The system provides authors with rapid, constructive feedback to improve their manuscripts before submission, though it is not intended to replace human peer review. OpenReviewer is available as an online demo and open-source tool.

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:27:33Z

**Summary**: A primary target of the \Euclid space mission is to constrain early-universe physics by searching for deviations from a primordial Gaussian random field. A significant detection of primordial non-Gaussianity would rule out the simplest models of cosmic inflation and transform our understanding of the origin of the Universe. This paper forecasts how well field-level inference of galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$), within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, in the upcoming \Euclid data. We design and simulate mock data sets and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses using a full-field forward modelling approach. By including the formation history of the cosmic matter field in the analysis, the method takes into account all available probes of primordial non-Gaussianity, and goes beyond statistical summary estimators of $f_{NL}$. Probes include, for example, two-point and higher-order statistics, peculiar velocity fields, and scale-dependent galaxy biases. Furthermore, the method simultaneously handles systematic survey effects, such as selection effects, survey geometries, and galaxy biases. The forecast shows that the method can reach precision levels of up to $\sigma (f_{NL}) = 2.3$ (68.3\% CI, and at the grid resolution $\Delta L = 62.5\,h^{-1}$Mpc) with \Euclid data. We also provide data products, including realistic $N$-body simulations with nonzero values of $f_{NL}$ and maps of adiabatic curvature fluctuations. The results underscore the feasibility and advantages of field-level inference to constrain $f_{NL}$ in galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach consistently captures all the information available in the large-scale structure to constrain $f_{NL}$, and resolves the degeneracy between early-universe physics and late-time gravitational effects, while mitigating the impact of systematic and observational effects.

### Precise Length Control in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bradley Butcher, Michael O'Keefe, James Titchener

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:22:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in production systems, powering applications such as chatbots, summarization, and question answering. Despite their success, controlling the length of their response remains a significant challenge, particularly for tasks requiring structured outputs or specific levels of detail. In this work, we propose a method to adapt pre-trained decoder-only LLMs for precise control of response length. Our approach incorporates a secondary length-difference positional encoding (LDPE) into the input embeddings, which counts down to a user-set response termination length. Fine-tuning with LDPE allows the model to learn to terminate responses coherently at the desired length, achieving mean token errors of less than 3 tokens. We also introduce Max New Tokens++, an extension that enables flexible upper-bound length control, rather than an exact target. Experimental results on tasks such as question answering and document summarization demonstrate that our method enables precise length control without compromising response quality.

**Authors**: Yibo Yan, Jiamin Su, Jianxiang He, Fangteng Fu, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Kun Wang, Shen Wang, Qingsong Wen, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:21:41Z

**Summary**: Mathematical reasoning, a core aspect of human cognition, is vital across many domains, from educational problem-solving to scientific advancements. As artificial general intelligence (AGI) progresses, integrating large language models (LLMs) with mathematical reasoning tasks is becoming increasingly significant. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of mathematical reasoning in the era of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We review over 200 studies published since 2021, and examine the state-of-the-art developments in Math-LLMs, with a focus on multimodal settings. We categorize the field into three dimensions: benchmarks, methodologies, and challenges. In particular, we explore multimodal mathematical reasoning pipeline, as well as the role of (M)LLMs and the associated methodologies. Finally, we identify five major challenges hindering the realization of AGI in this domain, offering insights into the future direction for enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities. This survey serves as a critical resource for the research community in advancing the capabilities of LLMs to tackle complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

### Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption   Configurations via Large Language Model Agent
**Authors**: Janghoon Ock, Tirtha Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:21:00Z

**Summary**: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling efficient screening for optimal catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.

### Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs
**Authors**: Jingyu Peng, Maolin Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Kai Zhang, Wanyu Wang, Pengyue Jia, Qidong Liu, Ruocheng Guo, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:20:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.

### Explainable Procedural Mistake Detection
**Authors**: Shane Storks, Itamar Bar-Yossef, Yayuan Li, Zheyuan Zhang, Jason J. Corso, Joyce Chai

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:13:55Z

**Summary**: Automated task guidance has recently attracted attention from the AI research community. Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging sub-problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed the task at hand (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant efforts in building resources and models for PMD, machine performance remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we recast PMD to an explanatory self-dialog of questions and answers, which serve as evidence for a decision. As this reformulation enables an unprecedented transparency, we leverage a fine-tuned natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated coherence metrics for generated explanations. Our results show that while open-source VLMs struggle with this task off-the-shelf, their accuracy, coherence, and dialog efficiency can be vastly improved by incorporating these coherence metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our multi-faceted metrics can visualize common outcomes at a glance, highlighting areas for improvement.

### FedMKT: Federated Mutual Knowledge Transfer for Large and Small Language   Models
**Authors**: Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yan Kang, Hanlin Gu, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:13:14Z

**Summary**: Recent research in federated large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on enabling clients to fine-tune their locally deployed homogeneous LLMs collaboratively or on transferring knowledge from server-based LLMs to small language models (SLMs) at downstream clients. However, a significant gap remains in the simultaneous mutual enhancement of both the server's LLM and clients' SLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose FedMKT, a parameter-efficient federated mutual knowledge transfer framework for large and small language models. This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum edit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between client-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their performance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a range of NLP text generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that FedMKT simultaneously boosts the performance of both LLMs and SLMs.

### PICLe: Pseudo-Annotations for In-Context Learning in Low-Resource Named   Entity Detection
**Authors**: Sepideh Mamooler, Syrielle Montariol, Alexander Mathis, Antoine Bosselut

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:09:35Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks using few demonstrations, facilitating task adaptation when labeled examples are hard to obtain. However, ICL is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, and it remains unclear which demonstration attributes enable in-context generalization. In this work, we conduct a perturbation study of in-context demonstrations for low-resource Named Entity Detection (NED). Our surprising finding is that in-context demonstrations with partially correct annotated entity mentions can be as effective for task transfer as fully correct demonstrations. Based off our findings, we propose Pseudo-annotated In-Context Learning (PICLe), a framework for in-context learning with noisy, pseudo-annotated demonstrations. PICLe leverages LLMs to annotate many demonstrations in a zero-shot first pass. We then cluster these synthetic demonstrations, sample specific sets of in-context demonstrations from each cluster, and predict entity mentions using each set independently. Finally, we use self-verification to select the final set of entity mentions. We evaluate PICLe on five biomedical NED datasets and show that, with zero human annotation, PICLe outperforms ICL in low-resource settings where limited gold examples can be used as in-context demonstrations.

### RetroLLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Retrieve Fine-grained   Evidence within Generation
**Authors**: Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yongkang Wu, Zhonghua Li, Qi Ye, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:03:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but often suffer from hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RetroLLM}, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, cohesive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of future sequences to improve evidence accuracy. Extensive experiments on five open-domain QA datasets demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/sunnynexus/RetroLLM}.

### Does VLM Classification Benefit from LLM Description Semantics?
**Authors**: Pingchuan Ma, Lennart Rietdorf, Dmytro Kotovenko, Vincent Tao Hu, Björn Ommer

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:01:18Z

**Summary**: Accurately describing images via text is a foundation of explainable AI. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have recently addressed this by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, expressing semantic similarities between vision and language embeddings. VLM classification can be improved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics, as the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling effect. Considering this, we ask how to distinguish the actual discriminative power of descriptions from performance boosts that potentially rely on an ensembling effect. To study this, we propose an alternative evaluation scenario that shows a characteristic behavior if the used descriptions have discriminative power. Furthermore, we propose a training-free method to select discriminative descriptions that work independently of classname ensembling effects. The training-free method works in the following way: A test image has a local CLIP label neighborhood, i.e., its top-$k$ label predictions. Then, w.r.t. to a small selection set, we extract descriptions that distinguish each class well in the local neighborhood. Using the selected descriptions, we demonstrate improved classification accuracy across seven datasets and provide in-depth analysis and insights into the explainability of description-based image classification by VLMs.

### Learning Human-Aware Robot Policies for Adaptive Assistance
**Authors**: Jason Qin, Shikun Ban, Wentao Zhu, Yizhou Wang, Dimitris Samaras

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:56:04Z

**Summary**: Developing robots that can assist humans efficiently, safely, and adaptively is crucial for real-world applications such as healthcare. While previous work often assumes a centralized system for co-optimizing human-robot interactions, we argue that real-world scenarios are much more complicated, as humans have individual preferences regarding how tasks are performed. Robots typically lack direct access to these implicit preferences. However, to provide effective assistance, robots must still be able to recognize and adapt to the individual needs and preferences of different users. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework in which robots infer human intentions and reason about human utilities through interaction. Our approach features two critical modules: the anticipation module is a motion predictor that captures the spatial-temporal relationship between the robot agent and user agent, which contributes to predicting human behavior; the utility module infers the underlying human utility functions through progressive task demonstration sampling. Extensive experiments across various robot types and assistive tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances task success and efficiency but also significantly improves user satisfaction, paving the way for more personalized and adaptive assistive robotic systems. Code and demos are available at https://asonin.github.io/Human-Aware-Assistance/.

### CharacterBench: Benchmarking Character Customization of Large Language   Models

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:55:34Z

**Summary**: Character-based dialogue (aka role-playing) enables users to freely customize characters for interaction, which often relies on LLMs, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' character customization capability. However, existing benchmarks fail to ensure a robust evaluation as they often only involve a single character category or evaluate limited dimensions. Moreover, the sparsity of character features in responses makes feature-focused generative evaluation both ineffective and inefficient. To address these issues, we propose CharacterBench, the largest bilingual generative benchmark, with 22,859 human-annotated samples covering 3,956 characters from 25 detailed character categories. We define 11 dimensions of 6 aspects, classified as sparse and dense dimensions based on whether character features evaluated by specific dimensions manifest in each response. We enable effective and efficient evaluation by crafting tailored queries for each dimension to induce characters' responses related to specific dimensions. Further, we develop CharacterJudge model for cost-effective and stable evaluations. Experiments show its superiority over SOTA automatic judges (e.g., GPT-4) and our benchmark's potential to optimize LLMs' character customization. Our repository is at https://github.com/thu-coai/CharacterBench.

### Playground of Lognormal Seminumerical Simulations of the Lyman $α$   Forest: Thermal History of the Intergalactic Medium
**Authors**: Tomas Ondro, Bhaskar Arya, Rudolf Galis

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:54:23Z

**Summary**: This study aims to test a potential application of lognormal seminumerical simulations to recover the thermal parameters and Jeans length. This could be suitable for generating large number of synthetic spectra with various input data and parameters, and thus ideal for interpreting the high-quality data obtained from QSO absorption spectra surveys.   We use a seminumerical approach to simulate absorption spectra of quasars at redshifts $ 3 \leq z \leq 5$. These synthetic spectra are compared with the 1D flux power spectra and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis method we determine the temperature at mean density, slope of the temperature-density relation and Jeans length. Our best-fit model is also compared with the evolution of the temperature of the intergalactic medium from various UVB models.   We show that the lognormal simulations can effectively recover thermal parameters and Jeans length. Besides, by comparing the synthetic flux power spectra with observations from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey we found, that such an approach can be also used for the cosmological parameter inference.

### Can Language Models Rival Mathematics Students? Evaluating Mathematical   Reasoning through Textual Manipulation and Human Experiments
**Authors**: Andrii Nikolaiev, Yiannos Stathopoulos, Simone Teufel

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:54:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper we look at the ability of recent large language models (LLMs) at solving mathematical problems in combinatorics. We compare models LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3.1, GPT-4, and Mixtral against each other and against human pupils and undergraduates with prior experience in mathematical olympiads. To facilitate these comparisons we introduce the Combi-Puzzles dataset, which contains 125 problem variants based on 25 combinatorial reasoning problems. Each problem is presented in one of five distinct forms, created by systematically manipulating the problem statements through adversarial additions, numeric parameter changes, and linguistic obfuscation. Our variations preserve the mathematical core and are designed to measure the generalisability of LLM problem-solving abilities, while also increasing confidence that problems are submitted to LLMs in forms that have not been seen as training instances. We found that a model based on GPT-4 outperformed all other models in producing correct responses, and performed significantly better in the mathematical variation of the problems than humans. We also found that modifications to problem statements significantly impact the LLM's performance, while human performance remains unaffected.

### Uncovering LLM-Generated Code: A Zero-Shot Synthetic Code Detector via   Code Rewriting
**Authors**: Tong Ye, Yangkai Du, Tengfei Ma, Lingfei Wu, Xuhong Zhang, Shouling Ji, Wenhai Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:42:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating code. However, the misuse of LLM-generated (synthetic) code has raised concerns in both educational and industrial contexts, underscoring the urgent need for synthetic code detectors. Existing methods for detecting synthetic content are primarily designed for general text and struggle with code due to the unique grammatical structure of programming languages and the presence of numerous ''low-entropy'' tokens. Building on this, our work proposes a novel zero-shot synthetic code detector based on the similarity between the original code and its LLM-rewritten variants. Our method is based on the observation that differences between LLM-rewritten and original code tend to be smaller when the original code is synthetic. We utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to train a code similarity model and evaluate our approach on two synthetic code detection benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing SOTA synthetic content detectors, with AUROC scores increasing by 20.5% on the APPS benchmark and 29.1% on the MBPP benchmark.

### Using Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models to Identify Indicators of   Vulnerability in Police Incident Narratives
**Authors**: Sam Relins, Daniel Birks, Charlie Lloyd

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:27:37Z

**Summary**: Objectives: Compare qualitative coding of instruction tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) against human coders in classifying the presence or absence of vulnerability in routinely collected unstructured text that describes police-public interactions. Evaluate potential bias in IT-LLM codings. Methods: Analyzing publicly available text narratives of police-public interactions recorded by Boston Police Department, we provide humans and IT-LLMs with qualitative labelling codebooks and compare labels generated by both, seeking to identify situations associated with (i) mental ill health; (ii) substance misuse; (iii) alcohol dependence; and (iv) homelessness. We explore multiple prompting strategies and model sizes, and the variability of labels generated by repeated prompts. Additionally, to explore model bias, we utilize counterfactual methods to assess the impact of two protected characteristics - race and gender - on IT-LLM classification. Results: Results demonstrate that IT-LLMs can effectively support human qualitative coding of police incident narratives. While there is some disagreement between LLM and human generated labels, IT-LLMs are highly effective at screening narratives where no vulnerabilities are present, potentially vastly reducing the requirement for human coding. Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that manipulations to both gender and race of individuals described in narratives have very limited effects on IT-LLM classifications beyond those expected by chance. Conclusions: IT-LLMs offer effective means to augment human qualitative coding in a way that requires much lower levels of resource to analyze large unstructured datasets. Moreover, they encourage specificity in qualitative coding, promote transparency, and provide the opportunity for more standardized, replicable approaches to analyzing large free-text police data sources.

### A Variable Occurrence-Centric Framework for Inconsistency Handling   (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yakoub Salhi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:22:10Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a syntactic framework for analyzing and handling inconsistencies in propositional bases. Our approach focuses on examining the relationships between variable occurrences within conflicts. We propose two dual concepts: Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR) and Maximal Consistency Relation (MCR). Each MIR is a minimal equivalence relation on variable occurrences that results in inconsistency, while each MCR is a maximal equivalence relation designed to prevent inconsistency. Notably, MIRs capture conflicts overlooked by minimal inconsistent subsets. Using MCRs, we develop a series of non-explosive inference relations. The main strategy involves restoring consistency by modifying the propositional base according to each MCR, followed by employing the classical inference relation to derive conclusions. Additionally, we propose an unusual semantics that assigns truth values to variable occurrences instead of the variables themselves. The associated inference relations are established through Boolean interpretations compatible with the occurrence-based models.

### Towards Understanding Systems Trade-offs in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Model Inference
**Authors**: Michael Shen, Muhammad Umar, Kiwan Maeng, G. Edward Suh, Udit Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:12:53Z

**Summary**: The rapid increase in the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased the cost involved in fine-tuning and retraining LLMs, a necessity for keeping models up to date and improving accuracy. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising approach to improving the capabilities and accuracy of LLMs without the necessity of retraining. Although RAG eliminates the need for continuous retraining to update model data, it incurs a trade-off in the form of slower model inference times. Resultingly, the use of RAG in enhancing the accuracy and capabilities of LLMs often involves diverse performance implications and trade-offs based on its design. In an effort to begin tackling and mitigating the performance penalties associated with RAG from a systems perspective, this paper introduces a detailed taxonomy and characterization of the different elements within the RAG ecosystem for LLMs that explore trade-offs within latency, throughput, and memory. Our study reveals underlying inefficiencies in RAG for systems deployment, that can result in TTFT latencies that are twice as long and unoptimized datastores that consume terabytes of storage.

### A Benchmark and Robustness Study of In-Context-Learning with Large   Language Models in Music Entity Detection
**Authors**: Simon Hachmeier, Robert Jäschke

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:11:03Z

**Summary**: Detecting music entities such as song titles or artist names is a useful application to help use cases like processing music search queries or analyzing music consumption on the web. Recent approaches incorporate smaller language models (SLMs) like BERT and achieve high results. However, further research indicates a high influence of entity exposure during pre-training on the performance of the models. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), these outperform SLMs in a variety of downstream tasks. However, researchers are still divided if this is applicable to tasks like entity detection in texts due to issues like hallucination. In this paper, we provide a novel dataset of user-generated metadata and conduct a benchmark and a robustness study using recent LLMs with in-context-learning (ICL). Our results indicate that LLMs in the ICL setting yield higher performance than SLMs. We further uncover the large impact of entity exposure on the best performing LLM in our study.

### Neural information field filter
**Authors**: Kairui Hao, Ilias Bilionis

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:10:12Z

**Summary**: We introduce neural information field filter, a Bayesian state and parameter estimation method for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems given large measurement datasets. Solving such a problem using traditional methods, such as Kalman and particle filters, is computationally expensive. Information field theory is a Bayesian approach that can efficiently reconstruct dynamical model state paths and calibrate model parameters from noisy measurement data. To apply the method, we parameterize the time evolution state path using the span of a finite linear basis. The existing method has to reparameterize the state path by initial states to satisfy the initial condition. Designing an expressive yet simple linear basis before knowing the true state path is crucial for inference accuracy but challenging. Moreover, reparameterizing the state path using the initial state is easy to perform for a linear basis, but is nontrivial for more complex and expressive function parameterizations, such as neural networks. The objective of this paper is to simplify and enrich the class of state path parameterizations using neural networks for the information field theory approach. To this end, we propose a generalized physics-informed conditional prior using an auxiliary initial state. We show the existing reparameterization is a special case. We parameterize the state path using a residual neural network that consists of a linear basis function and a Fourier encoding fully connected neural network residual function. The residual function aims to correct the error of the linear basis function. To sample from the intractable posterior distribution, we develop an optimization algorithm, nested stochastic variational inference, and a sampling algorithm, nested preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. A series of numerical and experimental examples verify and validate the proposed method.

### QUITO-X: A New Perspective on Context Compression from the Information   Bottleneck Theory
**Authors**: Yihang Wang, Xu Huang, Bowen Tian, Yueyang Su, Lei Yu, Huaming Liao, Yixing Fan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:03:54Z

**Summary**: Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial applications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities. However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the "lost in the middle" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.

### Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs
**Authors**: Junjie Chu, Yugeng Liu, Ziqing Yang, Xinyue Shen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:02:14Z

**Summary**: Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the safeguards of LLMs. While researchers have studied different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned experiment settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.

**Authors**: Jiawei Gu, Xuhui Jiang, Zhichao Shi, Hexiang Tan, Xuehao Zhai, Chengjin Xu, Wei Li, Yinghan Shen, Shengjie Ma, Honghao Liu, Yuanzhuo Wang, Jian Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:00:53Z

**Summary**: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.

### A Distributed Collaborative Retrieval Framework Excelling in All Queries   and Corpora based on Zero-shot Rank-Oriented Automatic Evaluation
**Authors**: Tian-Yi Che, Xian-Ling Mao, Chun Xu, Cheng-Xin Xin, Heng-Da Xu, Jin-Yu Liu, Heyan Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:55:57Z

**Summary**: Numerous retrieval models, including sparse, dense and llm-based methods, have demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting the relevance between queries and corpora. However, the preliminary effectiveness analysis experiments indicate that these models fail to achieve satisfactory performance on the majority of queries and corpora, revealing their effectiveness restricted to specific scenarios. Thus, to tackle this problem, we propose a novel Distributed Collaborative Retrieval Framework (DCRF), outperforming each single model across all queries and corpora. Specifically, the framework integrates various retrieval models into a unified system and dynamically selects the optimal results for each user's query. It can easily aggregate any retrieval model and expand to any application scenarios, illustrating its flexibility and scalability.Moreover, to reduce maintenance and training costs, we design four effective prompting strategies with large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the quality of ranks without reliance of labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed framework, combined with 8 efficient retrieval models, can achieve performance comparable to effective listwise methods like RankGPT and ListT5, while offering superior efficiency. Besides, DCRF surpasses all selected retrieval models on the most datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our prompting strategies on rank-oriented automatic evaluation.

### Targeted Angular Reversal of Weights (TARS) for Knowledge Removal in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Harry J. Davies, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo P. Mandic

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:54:00Z

**Summary**: The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs) poses significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive topics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted works. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt directions, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model performance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS) method of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the LLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a selected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then refines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high probability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and transforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward weight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation space, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are then replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the concept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method allows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the famous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is demonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced to 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the knowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across all languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has minimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse concepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token probabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015).

### DEMO: Reframing Dialogue Interaction with Fine-grained Element Modeling
**Authors**: Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:36:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, leading to the vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from the $\textit{Prelude}$ through the $\textit{Interlocution}$ to the $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite the large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmark that encompasses comprehensive dialogue elements, which hinders precise modeling, generation and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.

### Stochastic Model for a Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Driven by   Broadband Vibrations
**Authors**: Angelo Sanfelice, Luigi Costanzo, Alessandro Lo Schiavo, Alessandro Sarracino, Massimo Vitelli

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:33:33Z

**Summary**: We present an experimental and numerical study of a piezoelectric energy harvester driven by broadband vibrations. This device can extract power from random fluctuations and can be described by a stochastic model, based on an underdamped Langevin equation with white noise, which mimics the dynamics of the piezoelectric material. A crucial point in the modelisation is represented by the appropriate description of the coupled load circuit that is necessary to harvest electrical energy. We consider a linear load (resistance) and a nonlinear load (diode bridge rectifier connected to the parallel of a capacitance and a load resistance), and focus on the characteristic curve of the extracted power as a function of the load resistance, in order to estimate the optimal values of the parameters that maximise the collected energy. In both cases, we find good agreement between the numerical simulations of the theoretical model and the results obtained in experiments. In particular, we observe a non-monotonic behaviour of the characteristic curve which signals the presence of an optimal value for the load resistance at which the extracted power is maximised. We also address a more theoretical issue, related to the inference of the non-equilibrium features of the system from data: we show that the analysis of high-order correlation functions of the relevant variables, when in the presence of nonlinearities, can represent a simple and effective tool to check the irreversible dynamics.

### EventSum: A Large-Scale Event-Centric Summarization Dataset for Chinese   Multi-News Documents
**Authors**: Mengna Zhu, Kaisheng Zeng, Mao Wang, Kaiming Xiao, Lei Hou, Hongbin Huang, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:29:49Z

**Summary**: In real life, many dynamic events, such as major disasters and large-scale sports events, evolve continuously over time. Obtaining an overview of these events can help people quickly understand the situation and respond more effectively. This is challenging because the key information of the event is often scattered across multiple documents, involving complex event knowledge understanding and reasoning, which is under-explored in previous work. Therefore, we proposed the Event-Centric Multi-Document Summarization (ECS) task, which aims to generate concise and comprehensive summaries of a given event based on multiple related news documents. Based on this, we constructed the EventSum dataset, which was constructed using Baidu Baike entries and underwent extensive human annotation, to facilitate relevant research. It is the first large scale Chinese multi-document summarization dataset, containing 5,100 events and a total of 57,984 news documents, with an average of 11.4 input news documents and 13,471 characters per event. To ensure data quality and mitigate potential data leakage, we adopted a multi-stage annotation approach for manually labeling the test set. Given the complexity of event-related information, existing metrics struggle to comprehensively assess the quality of generated summaries. We designed specific metrics including Event Recall, Argument Recall, Causal Recall, and Temporal Recall along with corresponding calculation methods for evaluation. We conducted comprehensive experiments on EventSum to evaluate the performance of advanced long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) on this task. Our experimental results indicate that: 1) The event-centric multi-document summarization task remains challenging for existing long-context LLMs; 2) The recall metrics we designed are crucial for evaluating the comprehensiveness of the summary information.

### CLDA-YOLO: Visual Contrastive Learning Based Domain Adaptive YOLO   Detector
**Authors**: Tianheng Qiu, Ka Lung Law, Guanghua Pan, Jufei Wang, Xin Gao, Xuan Huang, Hu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:25:52Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) algorithms can markedly enhance the performance of object detectors under conditions of domain shifts, thereby reducing the necessity for extensive labeling and retraining. Current domain adaptive object detection algorithms primarily cater to two-stage detectors, which tend to offer minimal improvements when directly applied to single-stage detectors such as YOLO. Intending to benefit the YOLO detector from UDA, we build a comprehensive domain adaptive architecture using a teacher-student cooperative system for the YOLO detector. In this process, we propose uncertainty learning to cope with pseudo-labeling generated by the teacher model with extreme uncertainty and leverage dynamic data augmentation to asymptotically adapt the teacher-student system to the environment. To address the inability of single-stage object detectors to align at multiple stages, we utilize a unified visual contrastive learning paradigm that aligns instance at backbone and head respectively, which steadily improves the robustness of the detectors in cross-domain tasks. In summary, we present an unsupervised domain adaptive YOLO detector based on visual contrastive learning (CLDA-YOLO), which achieves highly competitive results across multiple domain adaptive datasets without any reduction in inference speed.

### UAlign: Leveraging Uncertainty Estimations for Factuality Alignment on   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boyang Xue, Fei Mi, Qi Zhu, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Erxin Yu, Xuming Hu, Kam-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:14:27Z

**Summary**: Despite demonstrating impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still often struggle to accurately express the factual knowledge they possess, especially in cases where the LLMs' knowledge boundaries are ambiguous. To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines.

### GPTKB: Comprehensively Materializing Factual LLM Knowledge
**Authors**: Yujia Hu, Tuan-Phong Nguyen, Shrestha Ghosh, Simon Razniewski

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:05:03Z

**Summary**: LLMs have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an availability bias (Tversky and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the discovery of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materializing an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation.   As a prototype, we employ GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, a large-scale knowledge base (KB) comprising 105 million triples for over 2.9 million entities - achieved at 1% of the cost of previous KB projects. This work marks a milestone in two areas: For LLM research, for the first time, it provides constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLMs' knowledge (or beliefs). For KB construction, it pioneers new pathways for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org.

### Variable importance measures for heterogeneous treatment effects with   survival outcome
**Authors**: Simon Christoffer Ziersen, Torben Martinussen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:01:22Z

**Summary**: Treatment effect heterogeneity plays an important role in many areas of causal inference and within recent years, estimation of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) has received much attention in the statistical community. While accurate estimation of the CATE-function through flexible machine learning procedures provides a tool for prediction of the individual treatment effect, it does not provide further insight into the driving features of potential treatment effect heterogeneity. Recent papers have addressed this problem by providing variable importance measures for treatment effect heterogeneity. Most of the suggestions have been developed for continuous or binary outcome, while little attention has been given to censored time-to-event outcome. In this paper, we extend the treatment effect variable importance measure (TE-VIM) proposed in Hines et al. (2022) to the survival setting with censored outcome. We derive an estimator for the TE-VIM for two different CATE functions based on the survival function and RMST, respectively. Along with the TE-VIM, we propose a new measure of treatment effect heterogeneity based on the best partially linear projection of the CATE and suggest accompanying estimators for that projection. All estimators are based on semiparametric efficiency theory, and we give conditions under which they are asymptotically linear. The finite sample performance of the derived estimators are investigated in a simulation study. Finally, the estimators are applied and contrasted in two real data examples.

### MAGIC: Generating Self-Correction Guideline for In-Context Text-to-SQL
**Authors**: Arian Askari, Christian Poelitz, Xinye Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:52:51Z

**Summary**: Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhance the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. We make all agent interactions publicly available to the research community, to foster further research in this area, offering a synthetic dataset for future explorations into automatic self-correction guideline generation.

### Impact of Face Alignment on Face Image Quality
**Authors**: Eren Onaran, Erdi Sarıtaş, Hazım Kemal Ekenel

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:49:57Z

**Summary**: Face alignment is a crucial step in preparing face images for feature extraction in facial analysis tasks. For applications such as face recognition, facial expression recognition, and facial attribute classification, alignment is widely utilized during both training and inference to standardize the positions of key landmarks in the face. It is well known that the application and method of face alignment significantly affect the performance of facial analysis models. However, the impact of alignment on face image quality has not been thoroughly investigated. Current FIQA studies often assume alignment as a prerequisite but do not explicitly evaluate how alignment affects quality metrics, especially with the advent of modern deep learning-based detectors that integrate detection and landmark localization. To address this need, our study examines the impact of face alignment on face image quality scores. We conducted experiments on the LFW, IJB-B, and SCFace datasets, employing MTCNN and RetinaFace models for face detection and alignment. To evaluate face image quality, we utilized several assessment methods, including SER-FIQ, FaceQAN, DifFIQA, and SDD-FIQA. Our analysis included examining quality score distributions for the LFW and IJB-B datasets and analyzing average quality scores at varying distances in the SCFace dataset. Our findings reveal that face image quality assessment methods are sensitive to alignment. Moreover, this sensitivity increases under challenging real-life conditions, highlighting the importance of evaluating alignment's role in quality assessment.

### EACO: Enhancing Alignment in Multimodal LLMs via Critical Observation
**Authors**: Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:47:29Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.

### No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need
**Authors**: Minghao Xu, Lichuan Xiang, Xu Cai, Hongkai Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:41:37Z

**Summary**: In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings.

### QUENCH: Measuring the gap between Indic and Non-Indic Contextual General   Reasoning in LLMs
**Authors**: Mohammad Aflah Khan, Neemesh Yadav, Sarah Masud, Md. Shad Akhtar

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:28:29Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a need for advanced benchmarking systems beyond traditional setups. To this end, we introduce QUENCH, a novel text-based English Quizzing Benchmark manually curated and transcribed from YouTube quiz videos. QUENCH possesses masked entities and rationales for the LLMs to predict via generation. At the intersection of geographical context and common sense reasoning, QUENCH helps assess world knowledge and deduction capabilities of LLMs via a zero-shot, open-domain quizzing setup. We perform an extensive evaluation on 7 LLMs and 4 metrics, investigating the influence of model size, prompting style, geographical context, and gold-labeled rationale generation. The benchmarking concludes with an error analysis to which the LLMs are prone.

**Authors**: Timothée Anne, Noah Syrkis, Meriem Elhosni, Florian Turati, Franck Legendre, Alain Jaquier, Sebastian Risi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:25:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. A promising but largely under-explored area is their potential to facilitate human coordination with many agents. Such capabilities would be useful in domains including disaster response, urban planning, and real-time strategy scenarios. In this work, we introduce (1) a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities and (2) a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 2,000 agents using natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with our hybrid approach solving tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and strategic points. However, our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing spatial visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans. This work sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in human-swarm coordination, paving the way for future research in this area. The HIVE project page, which includes videos of the system in action, can be found here: hive.syrkis.com.

### Lipschitz Singularities in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Zhantao Yang, Ruili Feng, Han Zhang, Yujun Shen, Kai Zhu, Lianghua Huang, Yifei Zhang, Yu Liu, Deli Zhao, Jingren Zhou, Fan Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:15:13Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models.

### DriveGazen: Event-Based Driving Status Recognition using Conventional   Camera
**Authors**: Xiaoyin Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:12:11Z

**Summary**: We introduce a wearable driving status recognition device and our open-source dataset, along with a new real-time method robust to changes in lighting conditions for identifying driving status from eye observations of drivers. The core of our method is generating event frames from conventional intensity frames, and the other is a newly designed Attention Driving State Network (ADSN). Compared to event cameras, conventional cameras offer complete information and lower hardware costs, enabling captured frames to encode rich spatial information. However, these textures lack temporal information, posing challenges in effectively identifying driving status. DriveGazen addresses this issue from three perspectives. First, we utilize video frames to generate realistic synthetic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events. Second, we adopt a spiking neural network to decode pertinent temporal information. Lastly, ADSN extracts crucial spatial cues from corresponding intensity frames and conveys spatial attention to convolutional spiking layers during both training and inference through a novel guide attention module to guide the feature learning and feature enhancement of the event frame. We specifically collected the Driving Status (DriveGaze) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we validate the superiority of the DriveGazen on the Single-eye Event-based Emotion (SEE) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to utilize guide attention spiking neural networks and eye-based event frames generated from conventional cameras for driving status recognition. Please refer to our project page for more details: https://github.com/TooyoungALEX/AAAI25-DriveGazen.

### Inferring additional physics through unmodelled signal reconstructions
**Authors**: Rimo Das, V. Gayathri, Divyajyoti, Sijil Jose, Imre Bartos, Sergey Klimenko, Chandra Kant Mishra

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:06:44Z

**Summary**: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.

### Generalized Bayesian deep reinforcement learning
**Authors**: Shreya Sinha Roy, Richard G. Everitt, Christian P. Robert, Ritabrata Dutta

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:02:17Z

**Summary**: Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) is a method that merges principles from Bayesian statistics and reinforcement learning to make optimal decisions in uncertain environments. Similar to other model-based RL approaches, it involves two key components: (1) Inferring the posterior distribution of the data generating process (DGP) modeling the true environment and (2) policy learning using the learned posterior. We propose to model the dynamics of the unknown environment through deep generative models assuming Markov dependence. In absence of likelihood functions for these models we train them by learning a generalized predictive-sequential (or prequential) scoring rule (SR) posterior. We use sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers to draw samples from this generalized Bayesian posterior distribution. In conjunction, to achieve scalability in the high dimensional parameter space of the neural networks, we use the gradient based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels within SMC. To justify the use of the prequential scoring rule posterior we prove a Bernstein-von Misses type theorem. For policy learning, we propose expected Thompson sampling (ETS) to learn the optimal policy by maximizing the expected value function with respect to the posterior distribution. This improves upon traditional Thompson sampling (TS) and its extensions which utilize only one sample drawn from the posterior distribution. This improvement is studied both theoretically and using simulation studies assuming discrete action and state-space. Finally we successfully extend our setup for a challenging problem with continuous action space without theoretical guarantees.

### CSR:Achieving 1 Bit Key-Value Cache via Sparse Representation
**Authors**: Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:01:53Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

**Authors**: Tianhao Li, Jingyu Lu, Chuangxin Chu, Tianyu Zeng, Yujia Zheng, Mei Li, Haotian Huang, Bin Wu, Zuoxian Liu, Kai Ma, Xuejing Yuan, Xingkai Wang, Keyan Ding, Huajun Chen, Qiang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:57:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have a transformative impact on a variety of scientific tasks across disciplines including biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics. However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily focusing on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such as molecular, protein, and genomic languages. Moreover, the safety mechanisms of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks. SciSafeEval spans multiple scientific languages-including textual, molecular, protein, and genomic-and covers a wide range of scientific domains. We evaluate LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a "jailbreak" enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention. Our benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in scientific contexts. This work aims to facilitate the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards in scientific research.

### Personalized LLM for Generating Customized Responses to the Same Query   from Different Users
**Authors**: Hang Zeng, Chaoyue Niu, Fan Wu, Chengfei Lv, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:57:19Z

**Summary**: Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLM, but overlooked the diversity of questioners. In this work, we propose a new form of questioner-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different questioners. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-questioner general encoder and a questioner-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same questioner, while pulling apart those of different questioners. To mitigate the impact of question diversity on questioner-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on question similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. We also build a multi-questioner dataset from English and Chinese scripts and WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 questioners and 12 responders. Extensive evaluation with different metrics shows a significant improvement in the quality of personalized response generation.

### GenderAlign: An Alignment Dataset for Mitigating Gender Bias in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Tao Zhang, Ziqian Zeng, Yuxiang Xiao, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen, James Foulds, Shimei Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:51:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that exhibits gender biases, raising significant ethical concerns. Alignment, the process of fine-tuning LLMs to better align with desired behaviors, is recognized as an effective approach to mitigate gender biases. Although proprietary LLMs have made significant strides in mitigating gender bias, their alignment datasets are not publicly available. The commonly used and publicly available alignment dataset, HH-RLHF, still exhibits gender bias to some extent. There is a lack of publicly available alignment datasets specifically designed to address gender bias. Hence, we developed a new dataset named GenderAlign, aiming at mitigating a comprehensive set of gender biases in LLMs. This dataset comprises 8k single-turn dialogues, each paired with a "chosen" and a "rejected" response. Compared to the "rejected" responses, the "chosen" responses demonstrate lower levels of gender bias and higher quality. Furthermore, we categorized the gender biases in the "rejected" responses of GenderAlign into 4 principal categories. The experimental results show the effectiveness of GenderAlign in reducing gender bias in LLMs.

### Selective Forgetting: Advancing Machine Unlearning Techniques and   Evaluation in Language Models
**Authors**: Lingzhi Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Jinsong Guo, Kam-Fai Wong, Georg Gottlob

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:44:07Z

**Summary**: This paper explores Machine Unlearning (MU), an emerging field that is gaining increased attention due to concerns about neural models unintentionally remembering personal or sensitive information. We present SeUL, a novel method that enables selective and fine-grained unlearning for language models. Unlike previous work that employs a fully reversed training objective in unlearning, SeUL minimizes the negative impact on the capability of language models, particularly in terms of generation. Furthermore, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics, sensitive extraction likelihood (S-EL) and sensitive memorization accuracy (S-MA), specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of forgetting sensitive information. In support of the unlearning framework, we propose efficient automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods. The online selection method, based on language probability scores, ensures computational efficiency, while the offline annotation involves a two-stage LLM-based process for robust verification. In summary, this paper contributes a novel selective unlearning method (SeUL), introduces specialized evaluation metrics (S-EL and S-MA) for assessing sensitive information forgetting, and proposes automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods to support the overall unlearning framework and evaluation process.

### LLMs Can Simulate Standardized Patients via Agent Coevolution
**Authors**: Zhuoyun Du, Lujie Zheng, Renjun Hu, Yuyang Xu, Xiawei Li, Ying Sun, Wei Chen, Jian Wu, Haolei Cai, Haohao Ying

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:36:47Z

**Summary**: Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Most research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulated patients focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability. The code will be available at https://github.com/ZJUMAI/EvoPatient.

**Authors**: Xuanming Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Yiming Zheng, Zhexin Zhang, Yuan Yuan, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:35:29Z

**Summary**: In real world software development, improper or missing exception handling can severely impact the robustness and reliability of code. Exception handling mechanisms require developers to detect, capture, and manage exceptions according to high standards, but many developers struggle with these tasks, leading to fragile code. This problem is particularly evident in open-source projects and impacts the overall quality of the software ecosystem. To address this challenge, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to improve exception handling in code. Through extensive analysis, we identify three key issues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception Block, and Distorted Handling Solution. These problems are widespread across real world repositories, suggesting that robust exception handling practices are often overlooked or mishandled. In response, we propose Seeker, a multi-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception handling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to enhance exception handling practices in real development scenarios, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability.

### MiMoTable: A Multi-scale Spreadsheet Benchmark with Meta Operations for   Table Reasoning
**Authors**: Zheng Li, Yang Du, Mao Zheng, Mingyang Song

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:33:12Z

**Summary**: Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for table reasoning and has significantly improved the performance on existing benchmarks. However, tables and user questions in real-world applications are more complex and diverse, presenting an unignorable gap compared to the existing benchmarks. To fill the gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ult\textbf{i}-scale spreadsheet benchmark with \textbf{M}eta \textbf{o}perations for \textbf{Table} reasoning, named as MiMoTable. Specifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in MiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven domains and contain different types. Second, we define a new criterion with six categories of meta operations for measuring the difficulty of each question in MiMoTable, simultaneously as a new perspective for measuring the difficulty of the existing benchmarks. Experimental results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the best performance with 77.4\% accuracy, indicating that there is still significant room to improve for LLMs on MiMoTable. Furthermore, we grade the difficulty of existing benchmarks according to our new criteria. Experiments have shown that the performance of LLMs decreases as the difficulty of benchmarks increases, thereby proving the effectiveness of our proposed new criterion.

**Authors**: Mukul Lokhande, Gopal Raut, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:25:57Z

**Summary**: The rapid adaptation of data driven AI models, such as deep learning inference, training, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and other HPC applications, drives a strong need for runtime precision configurable different non linear activation functions (AF) hardware support. Existing solutions support diverse precision or runtime AF reconfigurability but fail to address both simultaneously. This work proposes a flexible and SIMD multiprecision processing element (FlexPE), which supports diverse runtime configurable AFs, including sigmoid, tanh, ReLU and softmax, and MAC operation. The proposed design achieves an improved throughput of up to 16X FxP4, 8X FxP8, 4X FxP16 and 1X FxP32 in pipeline mode with 100% time multiplexed hardware. This work proposes an area efficient multiprecision iterative mode in the SIMD systolic arrays for edge AI use cases. The design delivers superior performance with up to 62X and 371X reductions in DMA reads for input feature maps and weight filters in VGG16, with an energy efficiency of 8.42 GOPS / W within the accuracy loss of 2%. The proposed architecture supports emerging 4-bit computations for DL inference while enhancing throughput in FxP8/16 modes for transformers and other HPC applications. The proposed approach enables future energy-efficient AI accelerators in edge and cloud environments.

### CoinMath: Harnessing the Power of Coding Instruction for Math LLMs
**Authors**: Chengwei Wei, Bin Wang, Jung-jae Kim, Guimei Liu, Nancy F. Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:21:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in solving mathematical problems, with code-based solutions proving particularly effective. However, the best practice to leverage coding instruction data to enhance mathematical reasoning remains underexplored. This study investigates three key questions: (1) How do different coding styles of mathematical code-based rationales impact LLMs' learning performance? (2) Can general-domain coding instructions improve performance? (3) How does integrating textual rationales with code-based ones during training enhance mathematical reasoning abilities? Our findings reveal that code-based rationales with concise comments, descriptive naming, and hardcoded solutions are beneficial, while improvements from general-domain coding instructions and textual rationales are relatively minor. Based on these insights, we propose CoinMath, a learning strategy designed to enhance mathematical reasoning by diversifying the coding styles of code-based rationales. CoinMath generates a variety of code-based rationales incorporating concise comments, descriptive naming conventions, and hardcoded solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that CoinMath significantly outperforms its baseline model, MAmmoTH, one of the SOTA math LLMs.

**Authors**: Matteo Esposito, Francesco Palagiano, Valentina Lenarduzzi, Davide Taibi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:21:05Z

**Summary**: Context. The security of critical infrastructure has been a fundamental concern since the advent of computers, and this concern has only intensified in today's cyber warfare landscape. Protecting mission-critical systems (MCSs), including essential assets like healthcare, telecommunications, and military coordination, is vital for national security. These systems require prompt and comprehensive governance to ensure their resilience, yet recent events have shown that meeting these demands is increasingly challenging. Aim. Building on prior research that demonstrated the potential of GAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in improving risk analysis tasks, we aim to explore practitioners' perspectives, specifically developers and security personnel, on using generative AI (GAI) in the governance of IT MCSs seeking to provide insights and recommendations for various stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Method. We designed a survey to collect practical experiences, concerns, and expectations of practitioners who develop and implement security solutions in the context of MCSs. Analyzing this data will help identify key trends, challenges, and opportunities for introducing GAIs in this niche domain. Conclusions and Future Works. Our findings highlight that the safe use of LLMs in MCS governance requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers should focus on designing regulation-oriented models and focus on accountability; practitioners emphasize data protection and transparency, while policymakers must establish a unified AI framework with global benchmarks to ensure ethical and secure LLMs-based MCS governance.

### A More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Approach Based on   LLM-Based Agents and Graphs
**Authors**: Zixin Liu, Ji Zhang, Yiran Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:13:49Z

**Summary**: Group polarization is an important research direction in social media content analysis, attracting many researchers to explore this field. Therefore, how to effectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring group polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not yet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group polarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses a significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts often contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and internet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic analysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we designed a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states. Furthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI) based on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding results. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of usability, accuracy, and interpretability.

### Mixture of Hidden-Dimensions Transformer
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Junyuan Shang, Zhengyu Zhang, Jiawei Sheng, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:12:19Z

**Summary**: Transformer models encounter challenges in scaling hidden dimensions efficiently, as uniformly increasing them inflates computational and memory costs while failing to emphasize the most relevant features for each token. For further understanding, we study hidden dimension sparsity and observe that trained Transformers utilize only a small fraction of token dimensions, revealing an "activation flow" pattern. Notably, there are shared sub-dimensions with sustained activation across multiple consecutive tokens and specialized sub-dimensions uniquely activated for each token. To better model token-relevant sub-dimensions, we propose MoHD (Mixture of Hidden Dimensions), a sparse conditional activation architecture. Particularly, MoHD employs shared sub-dimensions for common token features and a routing mechanism to dynamically activate specialized sub-dimensions. To mitigate potential information loss from sparsity, we design activation scaling and group fusion mechanisms to preserve activation flow. In this way, MoHD expands hidden dimensions with negligible increases in computation or parameters, efficient training and inference while maintaining performance. Evaluations across 10 NLP tasks show that MoHD surpasses Vanilla Transformers in parameter efficiency and task performance. It achieves 1.7% higher performance with 50% fewer activation parameters and 3.7% higher performance with a 3x parameter expansion at constant activation cost. MOHD offers a new perspective for scaling the model, showcasing the potential of hidden dimension sparsity to boost efficiency

### A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its   application in Bayesian inference
**Authors**: Li Ma, Benedetta Bruni

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:10:23Z

**Summary**: Tree-based models for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data and thus lead to inconsistent inference. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. This strategy parametrizes the tree-based sampling model according to the allocation of probability mass based on the observed data, and yet under appropriate specification, the resulting inference remains valid. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and in particular to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from using the partial likelihood.

### L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Hyesung Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-joon Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:06:53Z

**Summary**: Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces inference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained significant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into quantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while minimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous quantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantization (PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss. Meanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost comparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully quantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution. Using the LLaMA and Mistral models with instructional datasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot learning.

### TRIM: Token Reduction and Inference Modeling for Cost-Effective Language   Generation
**Authors**: Alfredo Garrachón Ruiz, Tomás de la Rosa, Daniel Borrajo

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:06:25Z

**Summary**: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a significant challenge due to their computational demands, specially on tasks requiring long outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.

### P$^2$ Law: Scaling Law for Post-Training After Model Pruning
**Authors**: Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Xiaokang Zhang, Yanling Wang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:00:34Z

**Summary**: Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for reducing the hardware requirements of large language models (LLMs). To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data.Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling \textbf{Law} for \textbf{P}ost-training after model \textbf{P}runing, referred to as the P$^2$ Law.This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P$^2$ Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs.

### Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite   Pixel Learning
**Authors**: Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:55:26Z

**Summary**: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

### Against All Odds: Overcoming Typology, Script, and Language Confusion in   Multilingual Embedding Inversion Attacks
**Authors**: Yiyi Chen, Russa Biswas, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:53:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks.

**Authors**: Dexter Le, Aybars Yunusoglu, Karn Tiwari, Murat Isik, I. Can Dikmen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:50:30Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of transportation systems, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising frontier for advancing intelligent decision-making across various applications. This paper introduces a novel 3-dimensional framework that encapsulates the intersection of applications, machine learning methodologies, and hardware devices, particularly emphasizing the role of LLMs. Instead of using multiple machine learning algorithms, our framework uses a single, data-centric LLM architecture that can analyze time series, images, and videos. We explore how LLMs can enhance data interpretation and decision-making in transportation. We apply this LLM framework to different sensor datasets, including time-series data and visual data from sources like Oxford Radar RobotCar, D-Behavior (D-Set), nuScenes by Motional, and Comma2k19. The goal is to streamline data processing workflows, reduce the complexity of deploying multiple models, and make intelligent transportation systems more efficient and accurate. The study was conducted using state-of-the-art hardware, leveraging the computational power of AMD RTX 3060 GPUs and Intel i9-12900 processors. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an average accuracy of 91.33\% across these datasets, with the highest accuracy observed in time-series data (92.7\%), showcasing the model's proficiency in handling sequential information essential for tasks such as motion planning and predictive maintenance. Through our exploration, we demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of LLMs in handling multimodal data within the transportation sector, ultimately providing insights into their application in real-world scenarios. Our findings align with the broader conference themes, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in advancing transportation technologies.

### Functional conditional volatility modeling with missing data: inference   and application to energy commodities
**Authors**: Abdelbasset Djeniah, Mohamed Chaouch, Amina Angelika Bouchentouf

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:27:06Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the nonparametric estimation of the volatility component in a heteroscedastic scalar-on-function regression model, where the underlying discrete-time process is ergodic and subject to a missing-at-random mechanism. We first propose a simplified estimator for the regression and volatility operators, constructed solely from the observed data. The asymptotic properties of these estimators, including the almost sure uniform consistency rate and asymptotic distribution, are rigorously analyzed. Subsequently, the simplified estimators are employed to impute the missing data in the original process, enhancing the estimation of the regression and volatility components. The asymptotic behavior of these imputed estimators is also thoroughly investigated. A numerical comparison of the simplified and imputed estimators is presented using simulated data. Finally, the methodology is applied to real-world data to model the volatility of daily natural gas returns, utilizing intraday EU/USD exchange rate return curves sampled at a 1-hour frequency.

**Authors**: Ryan Sze-Yin Chan, Federico Nanni, Angus R. Williams, Edwin Brown, Liam Burke-Moore, Ed Chapman, Kate Onslow, Tvesha Sippy, Jonathan Bright, Evelina Gabasova

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:26:21Z

**Summary**: Recent surge in Large Language Model (LLM) availability has opened exciting avenues for research. However, efficiently interacting with these models presents a significant hurdle since LLMs often reside on proprietary or self-hosted API endpoints, each requiring custom code for interaction. Conducting comparative studies between different models can therefore be time-consuming and necessitate significant engineering effort, hindering research efficiency and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we present prompto, an open source Python library which facilitates asynchronous querying of LLM endpoints enabling researchers to interact with multiple LLMs concurrently, while maximising efficiency and utilising individual rate limits. Our library empowers researchers and developers to interact with LLMs more effectively and allowing faster experimentation, data generation and evaluation. prompto is released with an introductory video (https://youtu.be/lWN9hXBOLyQ) under MIT License and is available via GitHub (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/prompto).

### LLM-DaaS: LLM-driven Drone-as-a-Service Operations from Text User   Requests
**Authors**: Lillian Wassim, Kamal Mohamed, Ali Hamdi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:25:56Z

**Summary**: We propose LLM-DaaS, a novel Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform free-text user requests into structured, actionable DaaS operation tasks. Our approach addresses the key challenge of interpreting and structuring natural language input to automate drone service operations under uncertain conditions. The system is composed of three main components: free-text request processing, structured request generation, and dynamic DaaS selection and composition. First, we fine-tune different LLM models such as Phi-3.5, LLaMA-3.2 7b and Gemma 2b on a dataset of text user requests mapped to structured DaaS requests. Users interact with our model in a free conversational style, discussing package delivery requests, while the fine-tuned LLM extracts DaaS metadata such as delivery time, source and destination locations, and package weight. The DaaS service selection model is designed to select the best available drone capable of delivering the requested package from the delivery point to the nearest optimal destination. Additionally, the DaaS composition model composes a service from a set of the best available drones to deliver the package from the source to the final destination. Second, the system integrates real-time weather data to optimize drone route planning and scheduling, ensuring safe and efficient operations. Simulations demonstrate the system's ability to significantly improve task accuracy, operational efficiency, and establish LLM-DaaS as a robust solution for DaaS operations in uncertain environments.

### How Reliable are LLMs as Knowledge Bases? Re-thinking Facutality and   Consistency
**Authors**: Danna Zheng, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:23:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as knowledge bases (KBs), yet current evaluation methods focus too narrowly on knowledge retention, overlooking other crucial criteria for reliable performance. In this work, we rethink the requirements for evaluating reliable LLM-as-KB usage and highlight two essential factors: factuality, ensuring accurate responses to seen and unseen knowledge, and consistency, maintaining stable answers to questions about the same knowledge. We introduce UnseenQA, a dataset designed to assess LLM performance on unseen knowledge, and propose new criteria and metrics to quantify factuality and consistency, leading to a final reliability score. Our experiments on 26 LLMs reveal several challenges regarding their use as KBs, underscoring the need for more principled and comprehensive evaluation.

### CEM: A Data-Efficient Method for Large Language Models to Continue   Evolving From Mistakes
**Authors**: Haokun Zhao, Haixia Han, Jie Shi, Chengyu Du, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:21:30Z

**Summary**: As world knowledge advances and new task schemas emerge, Continual Learning (CL) becomes essential for keeping Large Language Models (LLMs) current and addressing their shortcomings. This process typically involves continual instruction tuning (CIT) and continual pre-training (CPT) to enable these models to adapt to novel tasks and acquire critical knowledge. However, collecting sufficient CPT data and efficiently bridging knowledge gaps remain significant challenges. Inspired by the 'summarizing mistakes' strategy, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, a data-efficient approach aiming to collect CPT data and continually improve LLMs' performance through iterative evaluation and supplementation with mistake-relevant knowledge. To further optimize data usage and mitigate forgetting, we introduce a novel training paradigm that combines CIT and CPT. Experiments show that CEM substantially enhances multiple models' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA tasks, achieving gains of up to 29.63%. Code and datasets are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cem-BB25.

### C3oT: Generating Shorter Chain-of-Thought without Compromising   Effectiveness
**Authors**: Yu Kang, Xianghui Sun, Liangyu Chen, Wei Zou

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:12:45Z

**Summary**: Generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before deriving the answer can effectively improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and significantly improve the accuracy of the generated answer. However, in most cases, the length of the generated CoT is much longer than the desired final answer, which results in additional decoding costs. Furthermore, existing research has discovered that shortening the reasoning steps in CoT, even while preserving the key information, diminishes LLMs' abilities. These phenomena make it difficult to use LLMs and CoT in many real-world applications that only require the final answer and are sensitive to latency, such as search and recommendation. To reduce the costs of model decoding and shorten the length of the generated CoT, this paper presents $\textbf{C}$onditioned $\textbf{C}$ompressed $\textbf{C}$hain-of-$\textbf{T}$hought (C3oT), a CoT compression framework that involves a compressor to compress an original longer CoT into a shorter CoT while maintaining key information and interpretability, a conditioned training method to train LLMs with both longer CoT and shorter CoT simultaneously to learn the corresponding relationships between them, and a conditioned inference method to gain the reasoning ability learned from longer CoT by generating shorter CoT. We conduct experiments over four datasets from arithmetic and commonsense scenarios, showing that the proposed method is capable of compressing the length of generated CoT by up to more than 50% without compromising its effectiveness.

### Interpretable, multi-dimensional Evaluation Framework for Causal   Discovery from observational i.i.d. Data
**Authors**: Georg Velev, Stefan Lessmann

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:09:58Z

**Summary**: Nonlinear causal discovery from observational data imposes strict identifiability assumptions on the formulation of structural equations utilized in the data generating process. The evaluation of structure learning methods under assumption violations requires a rigorous and interpretable approach, which quantifies both the structural similarity of the estimation with the ground truth and the capacity of the discovered graphs to be used for causal inference. Motivated by the lack of unified performance assessment framework, we introduce an interpretable, six-dimensional evaluation metric, i.e., distance to optimal solution (DOS), which is specifically tailored to the field of causal discovery. Furthermore, this is the first research to assess the performance of structure learning algorithms from seven different families on increasing percentage of non-identifiable, nonlinear causal patterns, inspired by real-world processes. Our large-scale simulation study, which incorporates seven experimental factors, shows that besides causal order-based methods, amortized causal discovery delivers results with comparatively high proximity to the optimal solution.

### Steering Language Models with Game-Theoretic Solvers
**Authors**: Ian Gemp, Roma Patel, Yoram Bachrach, Marc Lanctot, Vibhavari Dasagi, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Siqi Liu, Karl Tuyls

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:03:31Z

**Summary**: Mathematical models of interactions among rational agents have long been studied in game theory. However these interactions are often over a small set of discrete game actions which is very different from how humans communicate in natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework that allows equilibrium solvers to work over the space of natural language dialogue generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by modelling the players, strategies and payoffs in a "game" of dialogue, we create a binding from natural language interactions to the conventional symbolic logic of game theory. Given this binding, we can ask existing game-theoretic algorithms to provide us with strategic solutions (e.g., what string an LLM should generate to maximize payoff in the face of strategic partners or opponents), giving us predictors of stable, rational conversational strategies. We focus on three domains that require different negotiation strategies: scheduling meetings, trading fruit and debate, and evaluate an LLM's generated language when guided by solvers. We see that LLMs that follow game-theory solvers result in dialogue generations that are less exploitable than the control (no guidance from solvers), and the language generated results in higher rewards, in all negotiation domains. We discuss future implications of this work, and how game-theoretic solvers that can leverage the expressivity of natural language can open up a new avenue of guiding language research.

### Private Yet Social: How LLM Chatbots Support and Challenge Eating   Disorder Recovery
**Authors**: Ryuhaerang Choi, Taehan Kim, Subin Park, Jennifer G Kim, Sung-Ju Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:59:49Z

**Summary**: Eating disorders (ED) are complex mental health conditions that require long-term management and support. Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based chatbots offer the potential to assist individuals in receiving immediate support. Yet, concerns remain about their reliability and safety in sensitive contexts such as ED. We explore the opportunities and potential harms of using LLM-based chatbots for ED recovery. We observe the interactions between 26 participants with ED and an LLM-based chatbot, WellnessBot, designed to support ED recovery, over 10 days. We discovered that our participants have felt empowered in recovery by discussing ED-related stories with the chatbot, which served as a personal yet social avenue. However, we also identified harmful chatbot responses, especially concerning individuals with ED, that went unnoticed partly due to participants' unquestioning trust in the chatbot's reliability. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for safe and effective LLM-based interventions in ED management.

### SAM Decoding: Speculative Decoding via Suffix Automaton
**Authors**: Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:48:28Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) has been demonstrated as an effective technique for lossless LLM inference acceleration. Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of model-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on incomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are constrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text sequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is $18\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of $3.28\%$ -- $11.13\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones. Our code is available at our \href{https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding}{repository}.

### SeSeMI: Secure Serverless Model Inference on Sensitive Data
**Authors**: Guoyu Hu, Yuncheng Wu, Gang Chen, Tien Tuan Anh Dinh, Beng Chin Ooi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:37:30Z

**Summary**: Model inference systems are essential for implementing end-to-end data analytics pipelines that deliver the benefits of machine learning models to users. Existing cloud-based model inference systems are costly, not easy to scale, and must be trusted in handling the models and user request data. Serverless computing presents a new opportunity, as it provides elasticity and fine-grained pricing. Our goal is to design a serverless model inference system that protects models and user request data from untrusted cloud providers. It offers high performance and low cost, while requiring no intrusive changes to the current serverless platforms. To realize our goal, we leverage trusted hardware. We identify and address three challenges in using trusted hardware for serverless model inference. These challenges arise from the high-level abstraction of serverless computing, the performance overhead of trusted hardware, and the characteristics of model inference workloads. We present SeSeMI, a secure, efficient, and cost-effective serverless model inference system. It adds three novel features non-intrusively to the existing serverless infrastructure and nothing else.The first feature is a key service that establishes secure channels between the user and the serverless instances, which also provides access control to models and users' data. The second is an enclave runtime that allows one enclave to process multiple concurrent requests. The final feature is a model packer that allows multiple models to be executed by one serverless instance. We build SeSeMI on top of Apache OpenWhisk, and conduct extensive experiments with three popular machine learning models. The results show that SeSeMI achieves low latency and low cost at scale for realistic workloads.

 ### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:58:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

**Authors**: Phoenix Alpine, Samriddhi Bhatia, Fernando Chierchie, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Rouven Essig, Juan Estrada, Erez Etzion, Roni Harnik, Michael Lembeck, Nathan Saffold, Sho Uemura

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:55:12Z

**Summary**: The DarkNESS (Dark Matter Nano-satellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors) mission aims to deploy a skipper-CCD CubeSat Observatory to search for dark matter (DM) from Low Earth Orbit. This mission will employ novel skipper-CCDs to investigate O(keV) X-rays from decaying DM, as well as electron recoils from strongly-interacting sub-GeV DM. The DarkNESS mission will be the first space deployment of skipper-CCDs, and the DarkNESS team is developing a skipper-CCD instrument that is compatible with the CubeSat platform. DarkNESS has recently progressed from laboratory validation to a Critical Design Review (CDR) phase, with a launch opportunity anticipated in late 2025. The implementation of the DarkNESS skipper-CCD payload on the CubeSat platform will pave the way for future demonstrators of space-based imagers for X-ray and single-electron counting applications.

### Making FETCH! Happen: Finding Emergent Dog Whistles Through Common   Habitats
**Authors**: Kuleen Sasse, Carlos Aguirre, Isabel Cachola, Sharon Levy, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:46:12Z

**Summary**: WARNING: This paper contains content that maybe upsetting or offensive to some readers. Dog whistles are coded expressions with dual meanings: one intended for the general public (outgroup) and another that conveys a specific message to an intended audience (ingroup). Often, these expressions are used to convey controversial political opinions while maintaining plausible deniability and slip by content moderation filters. Identification of dog whistles relies on curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce \textbf{FETCH!}, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora. We find that state-of-the-art systems fail to achieve meaningful results across three distinct social media case studies. We present \textbf{EarShot}, a novel system that combines the strengths of vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently and effectively identify new dog whistles.

### Comp-LTL: Temporal Logic Planning via Zero-Shot Policy Composition
**Authors**: Taylor Bergeron, Zachary Serlin, Kevin Leahy

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:39:49Z

**Summary**: This work develops a zero-shot mechanism, Comp-LTL, for an agent to satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification given existing task primitives trained via reinforcement learning (RL). Autonomous robots often need to satisfy spatial and temporal goals that are unknown until run time. Prior work focuses on learning policies for executing a task specified using LTL, but they incorporate the specification into the learning process. Any change to the specification requires retraining the policy, either via fine-tuning or from scratch. We present a more flexible approach -- to learn a set of composable task primitive policies that can be used to satisfy arbitrary LTL specifications without retraining or fine-tuning. Task primitives can be learned offline using RL and combined using Boolean composition at deployment. This work focuses on creating and pruning a transition system (TS) representation of the environment in order to solve for deterministic, non-ambiguous, and feasible solutions to LTL specifications given an environment and a set of task primitive policies. We show that our pruned TS is deterministic, contains no unrealizable transitions, and is sound. We verify our approach via simulation and compare it to other state of the art approaches, showing that Comp-LTL is safer and more adaptable.

### Toward Adaptive Large Language Models Structured Pruning via   Hybrid-grained Weight Importance Assessment
**Authors**: Jun Liu, Zhenglun Kong, Pu Zhao, Changdi Yang, Hao Tang, Xuan Shen, Geng Yuan, Wei Niu, Wenbin Zhang, Xue Lin, Dong Huang, Yanzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:31:27Z

**Summary**: Structured pruning for large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant academic interest due to its ability to efficiently compress and accelerate LLMs by eliminating redundant weight groups at a coarse-grained granularity. Current structured pruning methods for LLMs typically depend on a singular granularity for assessing weight importance, resulting in notable performance degradation in downstream tasks. Intriguingly, our empirical investigations reveal that utilizing unstructured pruning, which achieves better performance retention by pruning weights at a finer granularity, \emph{i.e.}, individual weights, yields significantly varied sparse LLM structures when juxtaposed to structured pruning. This suggests that evaluating both holistic and individual assessment for weight importance is essential for LLM pruning. Building on this insight, we introduce the Hybrid-grained Weight Importance Assessment (HyWIA), a novel method that merges fine-grained and coarse-grained evaluations of weight importance for the pruning of LLMs. Leveraging an attention mechanism, HyWIA adaptively determines the optimal blend of granularity in weight importance assessments in an end-to-end pruning manner. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, Baichuan, and Bloom across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HyWIA in pruning LLMs. For example, HyWIA surpasses the cutting-edge LLM-Pruner by an average margin of 2.82\% in accuracy across seven downstream tasks when pruning LLaMA-7B by 50\%.

### MGH Radiology Llama: A Llama 3 70B Model for Radiology
**Authors**: Yucheng Shi, Peng Shu, Zhengliang Liu, Zihao Wu, Quanzheng Li, Tianming Liu, Ninghao Liu, Xiang Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:25:26Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the field of radiology has increasingly harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and improve patient care. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as particularly promising tools, offering significant potential in assisting radiologists with report generation, clinical decision support, and patient communication. This paper presents an advanced radiology-focused large language model: MGH Radiology Llama. It is developed using the Llama 3 70B model, building upon previous domain-specific models like Radiology-GPT and Radiology-Llama2. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital, comprising over 6.5 million de-identified medical reports across various imaging modalities, the model demonstrates significant improvements in generating accurate and clinically relevant radiology impressions given the corresponding findings. Our evaluation, incorporating both traditional metrics and a GPT-4-based assessment, highlights the enhanced performance of this work over general-purpose LLMs.

### Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability   Detection
**Authors**: Ira Ceka, Feitong Qiao, Anik Dey, Aastha Valechia, Gail Kaiser, Baishakhi Ray

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:08:14Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.

### LLMs for Cold-Start Cutting Plane Separator Configuration
**Authors**: Connor Lawless, Yingxi Li, Anders Wikum, Madeleine Udell, Ellen Vitercik

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T18:03:57Z

**Summary**: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers ship with a staggering number of parameters that are challenging to select a priori for all but expert optimization users, but can have an outsized impact on the performance of the MILP solver. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches to configure solvers require training ML models by solving thousands of related MILP instances, generalize poorly to new problem sizes, and often require implementing complex ML pipelines and custom solver interfaces that can be difficult to integrate into existing optimization workflows. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM-based framework to configure which cutting plane separators to use for a given MILP problem with little to no training data based on characteristics of the instance, such as a natural language description of the problem and the associated LaTeX formulation. We augment these LLMs with descriptions of cutting plane separators available in a given solver, grounded by summarizing the existing research literature on separators. While individual solver configurations have a large variance in performance, we present a novel ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates configurations to create a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our LLM-based methodology requires no custom solver interface, can find a high-performing configuration by solving only a small number of MILPs, and can generate the configuration with simple API calls that run in under a second. Numerical results show our approach is competitive with existing configuration approaches on a suite of classic combinatorial optimization problems and real-world datasets with only a fraction of the training data and computation time.

### SpeechPrune: Context-aware Token Pruning for Speech Information   Retrieval
**Authors**: Yueqian Lin, Yuzhe Fu, Jingyang Zhang, Yudong Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Jingwei Sun, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:36:02Z

**Summary**: We introduce Speech Information Retrieval (SIR), a new long-context task for Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs), and present SPIRAL, a 1,012-sample benchmark testing models' ability to extract critical details from approximately 90-second spoken inputs. While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%. This approach highlights the potential of token-level pruning for efficient and scalable long-form speech understanding.

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:34:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern. With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end, we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate 10 S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when scoring holistically the toxicity of a prompt; and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microaggressions, bias). We release this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.

### The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs)
**Authors**: Jiya Manchanda, Laura Boettcher, Matheus Westphalen, Jasser Jasser

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:32:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their "black box" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.

### LLM-RG4: Flexible and Factual Radiology Report Generation across Diverse   Input Contexts
**Authors**: Zhuhao Wang, Yihua Sun, Zihan Li, Xuan Yang, Fang Chen, Hongen Liao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:29:51Z

**Summary**: Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where radiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical demands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are constrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding'' section from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and outputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could generate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between current RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a data generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers four common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded input and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based RRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible instruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further develop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle diverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the additional computational burden associated with increased input volumes. Besides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's attention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical efficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal input-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly suffer from this problem.

### Combining Large Language Models with Tutoring System Intelligence: A   Case Study in Caregiver Homework Support
**Authors**: Devika Venugopalan, Ziwen Yan, Conrad Borchers, Jionghao Lin, Vincent Aleven

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:22:40Z

**Summary**: Caregivers (i.e., parents and members of a child's caring community) are underappreciated stakeholders in learning analytics. Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula. An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support. Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them. Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning. We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM. This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat. Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation. We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems.

### ExecRepoBench: Multi-level Executable Code Completion Evaluation
**Authors**: Jian Yang, Jiajun Zhang, Jiaxi Yang, Ke Jin, Lei Zhang, Qiyao Peng, Ken Deng, Yibo Miao, Tianyu Liu, Zeyu Cui, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:14:35Z

**Summary**: Code completion has become an essential tool for daily software development. Existing evaluation benchmarks often employ static methods that do not fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world coding environments and face significant challenges, including limited context length, reliance on superficial evaluation metrics, and potential overfitting to training datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing code completion in software development through the creation of a repository-level benchmark ExecRepoBench and the instruction corpora Repo-Instruct, aim at improving the functionality of open-source large language models (LLMs) in real-world coding scenarios that involve complex interdependencies across multiple files. ExecRepoBench includes 1.2K samples from active Python repositories. Plus, we present a multi-level grammar-based completion methodology conditioned on the abstract syntax tree to mask code fragments at various logical units (e.g. statements, expressions, and functions). Then, we fine-tune the open-source LLM with 7B parameters on Repo-Instruct to produce a strong code completion baseline model Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C based on the open-source model. Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C is rigorously evaluated against existing benchmarks, including MultiPL-E and ExecRepoBench, which consistently outperforms prior baselines across all programming languages.

### SciFaultyQA: Benchmarking LLMs on Faulty Science Question Detection with   a GAN-Inspired Approach to Synthetic Dataset Generation
**Authors**: Debarshi Kundu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:11:48Z

**Summary**: Consider the problem: ``If one man and one woman can produce one child in one year, how many children will be produced by one woman and three men in 0.5 years?" Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer "0.5," which does not make sense. While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of "0.5 child." Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding. However, this is inconsistent.   These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty. We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid. By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions. We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.

### Cost-Effective Label-free Node Classification with LLMs
**Authors**: Taiyan Zhang, Renchi Yang, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan, Yurui Lai

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T17:04:40Z

**Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as go-to models for node classification in graph data due to their powerful abilities in fusing graph structures and attributes. However, such models strongly rely on adequate high-quality labeled data for training, which are expensive to acquire in practice. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), a promising way is to leverage their superb zero-shot capabilities and massive knowledge for node labeling. Despite promising results reported, this methodology either demands considerable queries to LLMs, or suffers from compromised performance caused by noisy labels produced by LLMs.   To remedy these issues, this work presents Cella, an active self-training framework that integrates LLMs into GNNs in a cost-effective manner. The design recipe of Cella is to iteratively identify small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extract informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Particularly, Cella includes three major components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a judicious sample selection scheme to sift out the "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module combining LLMs and GNNs with rewired topology. Our extensive experiments over five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Cella significantly outperforms the state of the arts under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. In particular, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Cella is able to achieve an 8.08% conspicuous improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.

**Authors**: Tong Xie, Yuwei Wan, Yixuan Liu, Yuchen Zeng, Wenjie Zhang, Chunyu Kit, Dongzhan Zhou, Bram Hoex

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:51:27Z

**Summary**: Materials discovery and design aim to find components and structures with desirable properties over highly complex and diverse search spaces. Traditional solutions, such as high-throughput simulations and machine learning (ML), often rely on complex descriptors, which hinder generalizability and transferability across tasks. Moreover, these descriptors may deviate from experimental data due to inevitable defects and purity issues in the real world, which may reduce their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose Darwin 1.5, an open-source large language model (LLM) tailored for materials science. By leveraging natural language as input, Darwin eliminates the need for task-specific descriptors and enables a flexible, unified approach to material property prediction and discovery. We employ a two-stage training strategy combining question-answering (QA) fine-tuning with multi-task learning (MTL) to inject domain-specific knowledge in various modalities and facilitate cross-task knowledge transfer. Through our strategic approach, we achieved a significant enhancement in the prediction accuracy of LLMs, with a maximum improvement of 60\% compared to LLaMA-7B base models. It further outperforms traditional machine learning models on various tasks in material science, showcasing the potential of LLMs to provide a more versatile and scalable foundation model for materials discovery and design.

### Inferring Functionality of Attention Heads from their Parameters
**Authors**: Amit Elhelo, Mor Geva

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:45:33Z

**Summary**: Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations.

### When Backdoors Speak: Understanding LLM Backdoor Attacks Through   Model-Generated Explanations
**Authors**: Huaizhi Ge, Yiming Li, Qifan Wang, Yongfeng Zhang, Ruixiang Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:44:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers embedded in poisoned samples can maliciously alter LLMs' behaviors. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.

### TurboAttention: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs   LLMs
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:37:07Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

### OpenReviewer: A Specialized Large Language Model for Generating Critical   Scientific Paper Reviews
**Authors**: Maximilian Idahl, Zahra Ahmadi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:31:00Z

**Summary**: We present OpenReviewer, an open-source system for generating high-quality peer reviews of machine learning and AI conference papers. At its core is Llama-OpenReviewer-8B, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top ML conferences. Given a PDF paper submission and review template as input, OpenReviewer extracts the full text, including technical content like equations and tables, and generates a structured review following conference-specific guidelines. Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer produces significantly more critical and realistic reviews compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5. While other LLMs tend toward overly positive assessments, OpenReviewer's recommendations closely match the distribution of human reviewer ratings. The system provides authors with rapid, constructive feedback to improve their manuscripts before submission, though it is not intended to replace human peer review. OpenReviewer is available as an online demo and open-source tool.

### Precise Length Control in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bradley Butcher, Michael O'Keefe, James Titchener

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:22:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in production systems, powering applications such as chatbots, summarization, and question answering. Despite their success, controlling the length of their response remains a significant challenge, particularly for tasks requiring structured outputs or specific levels of detail. In this work, we propose a method to adapt pre-trained decoder-only LLMs for precise control of response length. Our approach incorporates a secondary length-difference positional encoding (LDPE) into the input embeddings, which counts down to a user-set response termination length. Fine-tuning with LDPE allows the model to learn to terminate responses coherently at the desired length, achieving mean token errors of less than 3 tokens. We also introduce Max New Tokens++, an extension that enables flexible upper-bound length control, rather than an exact target. Experimental results on tasks such as question answering and document summarization demonstrate that our method enables precise length control without compromising response quality.

**Authors**: Yibo Yan, Jiamin Su, Jianxiang He, Fangteng Fu, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Kun Wang, Shen Wang, Qingsong Wen, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:21:41Z

**Summary**: Mathematical reasoning, a core aspect of human cognition, is vital across many domains, from educational problem-solving to scientific advancements. As artificial general intelligence (AGI) progresses, integrating large language models (LLMs) with mathematical reasoning tasks is becoming increasingly significant. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of mathematical reasoning in the era of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We review over 200 studies published since 2021, and examine the state-of-the-art developments in Math-LLMs, with a focus on multimodal settings. We categorize the field into three dimensions: benchmarks, methodologies, and challenges. In particular, we explore multimodal mathematical reasoning pipeline, as well as the role of (M)LLMs and the associated methodologies. Finally, we identify five major challenges hindering the realization of AGI in this domain, offering insights into the future direction for enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities. This survey serves as a critical resource for the research community in advancing the capabilities of LLMs to tackle complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

### Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption   Configurations via Large Language Model Agent
**Authors**: Janghoon Ock, Tirtha Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:21:00Z

**Summary**: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling efficient screening for optimal catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.

### Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs
**Authors**: Jingyu Peng, Maolin Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Kai Zhang, Wanyu Wang, Pengyue Jia, Qidong Liu, Ruocheng Guo, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:20:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.

### FedMKT: Federated Mutual Knowledge Transfer for Large and Small Language   Models
**Authors**: Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yan Kang, Hanlin Gu, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:13:14Z

**Summary**: Recent research in federated large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on enabling clients to fine-tune their locally deployed homogeneous LLMs collaboratively or on transferring knowledge from server-based LLMs to small language models (SLMs) at downstream clients. However, a significant gap remains in the simultaneous mutual enhancement of both the server's LLM and clients' SLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose FedMKT, a parameter-efficient federated mutual knowledge transfer framework for large and small language models. This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum edit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between client-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their performance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a range of NLP text generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that FedMKT simultaneously boosts the performance of both LLMs and SLMs.

### PICLe: Pseudo-Annotations for In-Context Learning in Low-Resource Named   Entity Detection
**Authors**: Sepideh Mamooler, Syrielle Montariol, Alexander Mathis, Antoine Bosselut

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:09:35Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks using few demonstrations, facilitating task adaptation when labeled examples are hard to obtain. However, ICL is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, and it remains unclear which demonstration attributes enable in-context generalization. In this work, we conduct a perturbation study of in-context demonstrations for low-resource Named Entity Detection (NED). Our surprising finding is that in-context demonstrations with partially correct annotated entity mentions can be as effective for task transfer as fully correct demonstrations. Based off our findings, we propose Pseudo-annotated In-Context Learning (PICLe), a framework for in-context learning with noisy, pseudo-annotated demonstrations. PICLe leverages LLMs to annotate many demonstrations in a zero-shot first pass. We then cluster these synthetic demonstrations, sample specific sets of in-context demonstrations from each cluster, and predict entity mentions using each set independently. Finally, we use self-verification to select the final set of entity mentions. We evaluate PICLe on five biomedical NED datasets and show that, with zero human annotation, PICLe outperforms ICL in low-resource settings where limited gold examples can be used as in-context demonstrations.

### RetroLLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Retrieve Fine-grained   Evidence within Generation
**Authors**: Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yongkang Wu, Zhonghua Li, Qi Ye, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:03:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but often suffer from hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RetroLLM}, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, cohesive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of future sequences to improve evidence accuracy. Extensive experiments on five open-domain QA datasets demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/sunnynexus/RetroLLM}.

### Does VLM Classification Benefit from LLM Description Semantics?
**Authors**: Pingchuan Ma, Lennart Rietdorf, Dmytro Kotovenko, Vincent Tao Hu, Björn Ommer

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T16:01:18Z

**Summary**: Accurately describing images via text is a foundation of explainable AI. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have recently addressed this by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, expressing semantic similarities between vision and language embeddings. VLM classification can be improved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics, as the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling effect. Considering this, we ask how to distinguish the actual discriminative power of descriptions from performance boosts that potentially rely on an ensembling effect. To study this, we propose an alternative evaluation scenario that shows a characteristic behavior if the used descriptions have discriminative power. Furthermore, we propose a training-free method to select discriminative descriptions that work independently of classname ensembling effects. The training-free method works in the following way: A test image has a local CLIP label neighborhood, i.e., its top-$k$ label predictions. Then, w.r.t. to a small selection set, we extract descriptions that distinguish each class well in the local neighborhood. Using the selected descriptions, we demonstrate improved classification accuracy across seven datasets and provide in-depth analysis and insights into the explainability of description-based image classification by VLMs.

### CharacterBench: Benchmarking Character Customization of Large Language   Models

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:55:34Z

**Summary**: Character-based dialogue (aka role-playing) enables users to freely customize characters for interaction, which often relies on LLMs, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' character customization capability. However, existing benchmarks fail to ensure a robust evaluation as they often only involve a single character category or evaluate limited dimensions. Moreover, the sparsity of character features in responses makes feature-focused generative evaluation both ineffective and inefficient. To address these issues, we propose CharacterBench, the largest bilingual generative benchmark, with 22,859 human-annotated samples covering 3,956 characters from 25 detailed character categories. We define 11 dimensions of 6 aspects, classified as sparse and dense dimensions based on whether character features evaluated by specific dimensions manifest in each response. We enable effective and efficient evaluation by crafting tailored queries for each dimension to induce characters' responses related to specific dimensions. Further, we develop CharacterJudge model for cost-effective and stable evaluations. Experiments show its superiority over SOTA automatic judges (e.g., GPT-4) and our benchmark's potential to optimize LLMs' character customization.

### Can Language Models Rival Mathematics Students? Evaluating Mathematical   Reasoning through Textual Manipulation and Human Experiments
**Authors**: Andrii Nikolaiev, Yiannos Stathopoulos, Simone Teufel

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:54:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper we look at the ability of recent large language models (LLMs) at solving mathematical problems in combinatorics. We compare models LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3.1, GPT-4, and Mixtral against each other and against human pupils and undergraduates with prior experience in mathematical olympiads. To facilitate these comparisons we introduce the Combi-Puzzles dataset, which contains 125 problem variants based on 25 combinatorial reasoning problems. Each problem is presented in one of five distinct forms, created by systematically manipulating the problem statements through adversarial additions, numeric parameter changes, and linguistic obfuscation. Our variations preserve the mathematical core and are designed to measure the generalisability of LLM problem-solving abilities, while also increasing confidence that problems are submitted to LLMs in forms that have not been seen as training instances. We found that a model based on GPT-4 outperformed all other models in producing correct responses, and performed significantly better in the mathematical variation of the problems than humans. We also found that modifications to problem statements significantly impact the LLM's performance, while human performance remains unaffected.

### Uncovering LLM-Generated Code: A Zero-Shot Synthetic Code Detector via   Code Rewriting
**Authors**: Tong Ye, Yangkai Du, Tengfei Ma, Lingfei Wu, Xuhong Zhang, Shouling Ji, Wenhai Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:42:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating code. However, the misuse of LLM-generated (synthetic) code has raised concerns in both educational and industrial contexts, underscoring the urgent need for synthetic code detectors. Existing methods for detecting synthetic content are primarily designed for general text and struggle with code due to the unique grammatical structure of programming languages and the presence of numerous ''low-entropy'' tokens. Building on this, our work proposes a novel zero-shot synthetic code detector based on the similarity between the original code and its LLM-rewritten variants. Our method is based on the observation that differences between LLM-rewritten and original code tend to be smaller when the original code is synthetic. We utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to train a code similarity model and evaluate our approach on two synthetic code detection benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing SOTA synthetic content detectors, with AUROC scores increasing by 20.5% on the APPS benchmark and 29.1% on the MBPP benchmark.

### Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation Testbed for Geomagnetic Navigation
**Authors**: Songnan Yang, Shiliang Zhang, Qianyun Zhang, Xiaohui Zhang, Xuehui Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:31:15Z

**Summary**: Geomagnetic navigation leverages the ubiquitous Earth's magnetic signals to navigate missions, without dependence on GPS services or pre-stored geographic maps. It has drawn increasing attention and is promising particularly for long-range navigation into unexplored areas. Current geomagnetic navigation studies are still in the early stages with simulations and computational validations, without concrete efforts to develop cost-friendly test platforms that can empower deployment and experimental analysis of the developed approaches. This paper presents a hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed to support geomagnetic navigation experimentation. Our testbed is dedicated to synthesizing geomagnetic field environment for the navigation. We develop the software in the testbed to simulate the dynamics of the navigation environment, and we build the hardware to generate the physical magnetic field, which follows and aligns with the simulated environment. The testbed aims to provide controllable magnetic field that can be used to experiment with geomagnetic navigation in labs, thus avoiding real and expensive navigation experiments, e.g., in the ocean, for validating navigation prototypes. We build the testbed with off-the-shelf hardware in an unshielded environment to reduce cost. We also develop the field generation control and hardware parameter optimization for quality magnetic field generation. We conduct a detailed performance analysis to show the quality of the field generation by the testbed, and we report the experimental results on performance indicators, including accuracy, uniformity, stability, and convergence of the generated field towards the target geomagnetic environment.

### Using Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models to Identify Indicators of   Vulnerability in Police Incident Narratives
**Authors**: Sam Relins, Daniel Birks, Charlie Lloyd

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:27:37Z

**Summary**: Objectives: Compare qualitative coding of instruction tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) against human coders in classifying the presence or absence of vulnerability in routinely collected unstructured text that describes police-public interactions. Evaluate potential bias in IT-LLM codings. Methods: Analyzing publicly available text narratives of police-public interactions recorded by Boston Police Department, we provide humans and IT-LLMs with qualitative labelling codebooks and compare labels generated by both, seeking to identify situations associated with (i) mental ill health; (ii) substance misuse; (iii) alcohol dependence; and (iv) homelessness. We explore multiple prompting strategies and model sizes, and the variability of labels generated by repeated prompts. Additionally, to explore model bias, we utilize counterfactual methods to assess the impact of two protected characteristics - race and gender - on IT-LLM classification. Results: Results demonstrate that IT-LLMs can effectively support human qualitative coding of police incident narratives. While there is some disagreement between LLM and human generated labels, IT-LLMs are highly effective at screening narratives where no vulnerabilities are present, potentially vastly reducing the requirement for human coding. Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that manipulations to both gender and race of individuals described in narratives have very limited effects on IT-LLM classifications beyond those expected by chance. Conclusions: IT-LLMs offer effective means to augment human qualitative coding in a way that requires much lower levels of resource to analyze large unstructured datasets. Moreover, they encourage specificity in qualitative coding, promote transparency, and provide the opportunity for more standardized, replicable approaches to analyzing large free-text police data sources.

### Towards Understanding Systems Trade-offs in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Model Inference
**Authors**: Michael Shen, Muhammad Umar, Kiwan Maeng, G. Edward Suh, Udit Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:12:53Z

**Summary**: The rapid increase in the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased the cost involved in fine-tuning and retraining LLMs, a necessity for keeping models up to date and improving accuracy. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising approach to improving the capabilities and accuracy of LLMs without the necessity of retraining. Although RAG eliminates the need for continuous retraining to update model data, it incurs a trade-off in the form of slower model inference times. Resultingly, the use of RAG in enhancing the accuracy and capabilities of LLMs often involves diverse performance implications and trade-offs based on its design. In an effort to begin tackling and mitigating the performance penalties associated with RAG from a systems perspective, this paper introduces a detailed taxonomy and characterization of the different elements within the RAG ecosystem for LLMs that explore trade-offs within latency, throughput, and memory. Our study reveals underlying inefficiencies in RAG for systems deployment, that can result in TTFT latencies that are twice as long and unoptimized datastores that consume terabytes of storage.

### A Benchmark and Robustness Study of In-Context-Learning with Large   Language Models in Music Entity Detection
**Authors**: Simon Hachmeier, Robert Jäschke

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:11:03Z

**Summary**: Detecting music entities such as song titles or artist names is a useful application to help use cases like processing music search queries or analyzing music consumption on the web. Recent approaches incorporate smaller language models (SLMs) like BERT and achieve high results. However, further research indicates a high influence of entity exposure during pre-training on the performance of the models. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), these outperform SLMs in a variety of downstream tasks. However, researchers are still divided if this is applicable to tasks like entity detection in texts due to issues like hallucination. In this paper, we provide a novel dataset of user-generated metadata and conduct a benchmark and a robustness study using recent LLMs with in-context-learning (ICL). Our results indicate that LLMs in the ICL setting yield higher performance than SLMs. We further uncover the large impact of entity exposure on the best performing LLM in our study.

### QUITO-X: A New Perspective on Context Compression from the Information   Bottleneck Theory
**Authors**: Yihang Wang, Xu Huang, Bowen Tian, Yueyang Su, Lei Yu, Huaming Liao, Yixing Fan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:03:54Z

**Summary**: Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial applications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities. However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the "lost in the middle" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.

### Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs
**Authors**: Junjie Chu, Yugeng Liu, Ziqing Yang, Xinyue Shen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:02:14Z

**Summary**: Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the safeguards of LLMs. While researchers have studied different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned experiment settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.

**Authors**: Jiawei Gu, Xuhui Jiang, Zhichao Shi, Hexiang Tan, Xuehao Zhai, Chengjin Xu, Wei Li, Yinghan Shen, Shengjie Ma, Honghao Liu, Yuanzhuo Wang, Jian Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T15:00:53Z

**Summary**: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.

### A Distributed Collaborative Retrieval Framework Excelling in All Queries   and Corpora based on Zero-shot Rank-Oriented Automatic Evaluation
**Authors**: Tian-Yi Che, Xian-Ling Mao, Chun Xu, Cheng-Xin Xin, Heng-Da Xu, Jin-Yu Liu, Heyan Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:55:57Z

**Summary**: Numerous retrieval models, including sparse, dense and llm-based methods, have demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting the relevance between queries and corpora. However, the preliminary effectiveness analysis experiments indicate that these models fail to achieve satisfactory performance on the majority of queries and corpora, revealing their effectiveness restricted to specific scenarios. Thus, to tackle this problem, we propose a novel Distributed Collaborative Retrieval Framework (DCRF), outperforming each single model across all queries and corpora. Specifically, the framework integrates various retrieval models into a unified system and dynamically selects the optimal results for each user's query. It can easily aggregate any retrieval model and expand to any application scenarios, illustrating its flexibility and scalability.Moreover, to reduce maintenance and training costs, we design four effective prompting strategies with large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the quality of ranks without reliance of labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed framework, combined with 8 efficient retrieval models, can achieve performance comparable to effective listwise methods like RankGPT and ListT5, while offering superior efficiency. Besides, DCRF surpasses all selected retrieval models on the most datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our prompting strategies on rank-oriented automatic evaluation.

### Targeted Angular Reversal of Weights (TARS) for Knowledge Removal in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Harry J. Davies, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo P. Mandic

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:54:00Z

**Summary**: The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs) poses significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive topics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted works. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt directions, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model performance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS) method of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the LLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a selected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then refines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high probability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and transforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward weight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation space, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are then replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the concept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method allows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the famous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is demonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced to 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the knowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across all languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has minimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse concepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token probabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015).

### DEMO: Reframing Dialogue Interaction with Fine-grained Element Modeling
**Authors**: Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:36:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, leading to the vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from the $\textit{Prelude}$ through the $\textit{Interlocution}$ to the $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite the large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmark that encompasses comprehensive dialogue elements, which hinders precise modeling, generation and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.

### EventSum: A Large-Scale Event-Centric Summarization Dataset for Chinese   Multi-News Documents
**Authors**: Mengna Zhu, Kaisheng Zeng, Mao Wang, Kaiming Xiao, Lei Hou, Hongbin Huang, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:29:49Z

**Summary**: In real life, many dynamic events, such as major disasters and large-scale sports events, evolve continuously over time. Obtaining an overview of these events can help people quickly understand the situation and respond more effectively. This is challenging because the key information of the event is often scattered across multiple documents, involving complex event knowledge understanding and reasoning, which is under-explored in previous work. Therefore, we proposed the Event-Centric Multi-Document Summarization (ECS) task, which aims to generate concise and comprehensive summaries of a given event based on multiple related news documents. Based on this, we constructed the EventSum dataset, which was constructed using Baidu Baike entries and underwent extensive human annotation, to facilitate relevant research. It is the first large scale Chinese multi-document summarization dataset, containing 5,100 events and a total of 57,984 news documents, with an average of 11.4 input news documents and 13,471 characters per event. To ensure data quality and mitigate potential data leakage, we adopted a multi-stage annotation approach for manually labeling the test set. Given the complexity of event-related information, existing metrics struggle to comprehensively assess the quality of generated summaries. We designed specific metrics including Event Recall, Argument Recall, Causal Recall, and Temporal Recall along with corresponding calculation methods for evaluation. We conducted comprehensive experiments on EventSum to evaluate the performance of advanced long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) on this task. Our experimental results indicate that: 1) The event-centric multi-document summarization task remains challenging for existing long-context LLMs; 2) The recall metrics we designed are crucial for evaluating the comprehensiveness of the summary information.

### Designing Semi-Structured Pruning of Graph Convolutional Networks for   Skeleton-based Recognition
**Authors**: Hichem Sahbi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:29:31Z

**Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are nowadays witnessing a major success in solving many pattern recognition tasks including skeleton-based classification. The deployment of DNNs on edge-devices, endowed with limited time and memory resources, requires designing lightweight and efficient variants of these networks. Pruning is one of the lightweight network design techniques that operate by removing unnecessary network parts, in a structured or an unstructured manner, including individual weights, neurons or even entire channels. Nonetheless, structured and unstructured pruning methods, when applied separately, may either be inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we devise a novel semi-structured method that discards the downsides of structured and unstructured pruning while gathering their upsides to some extent. The proposed solution is based on a differentiable cascaded parametrization which combines (i) a band-stop mechanism that prunes weights depending on their magnitudes, (ii) a weight-sharing parametrization that prunes connections either individually or group-wise, and (iii) a gating mechanism which arbitrates between different group-wise and entry-wise pruning. All these cascaded parametrizations are built upon a common latent tensor which is trained end-to-end by minimizing a classification loss and a surrogate tensor rank regularizer. Extensive experiments, conducted on the challenging tasks of action and hand-gesture recognition, show the clear advantage of our proposed semi-structured pruning approach against both structured and unstructured pruning, when taken separately, as well as the related work.

### UAlign: Leveraging Uncertainty Estimations for Factuality Alignment on   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boyang Xue, Fei Mi, Qi Zhu, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Erxin Yu, Xuming Hu, Kam-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:14:27Z

**Summary**: Despite demonstrating impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still often struggle to accurately express the factual knowledge they possess, especially in cases where the LLMs' knowledge boundaries are ambiguous. To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines.

### Scalable Temporal Anomaly Causality Discovery in Large Systems:   Achieving Computational Efficiency with Binary Anomaly Flag Data
**Authors**: Mulugeta Weldezgina Asres, Christian Walter Omlin, The CMS-HCAL Collaboration

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:11:28Z

**Summary**: Extracting anomaly causality facilitates diagnostics once monitoring systems detect system faults. Identifying anomaly causes in large systems involves investigating a more extensive set of monitoring variables across multiple subsystems. However, learning causal graphs comes with a significant computational burden that restrains the applicability of most existing methods in real-time and large-scale deployments. In addition, modern monitoring applications for large systems often generate large amounts of binary alarm flags, and the distinct characteristics of binary anomaly data -- the meaning of state transition and data sparsity -- challenge existing causality learning mechanisms. This study proposes an anomaly causal discovery approach (AnomalyCD), addressing the accuracy and computational challenges of generating causal graphs from binary flag data sets. The AnomalyCD framework presents several strategies, such as anomaly flag characteristics incorporating causality testing, sparse data and link compression, and edge pruning adjustment approaches. We validate the performance of this framework on two datasets: monitoring sensor data of the readout-box system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN, and a public data set for information technology monitoring. The results demonstrate the considerable reduction of the computation overhead and moderate enhancement of the accuracy of temporal causal discovery on binary anomaly data sets.

### GPTKB: Comprehensively Materializing Factual LLM Knowledge
**Authors**: Yujia Hu, Tuan-Phong Nguyen, Shrestha Ghosh, Simon Razniewski

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:05:03Z

**Summary**: LLMs have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an availability bias (Tversky and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the discovery of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materializing an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation.   As a prototype, we employ GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, a large-scale knowledge base (KB) comprising 105 million triples for over 2.9 million entities - achieved at 1% of the cost of previous KB projects. This work marks a milestone in two areas: For LLM research, for the first time, it provides constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLMs' knowledge (or beliefs). For KB construction, it pioneers new pathways for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org.

### PBI-Attack: Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack   for Toxicity Maximization
**Authors**: Ruoxi Cheng, Yizhong Ding, Shuirong Cao, Ranjie Duan, Xiaoshuang Jia, Shaowei Yuan, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiaojun Jia

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:56:29Z

**Summary**: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.

### MAGIC: Generating Self-Correction Guideline for In-Context Text-to-SQL
**Authors**: Arian Askari, Christian Poelitz, Xinye Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:52:51Z

**Summary**: Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhance the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. We make all agent interactions publicly available to the research community, to foster further research in this area, offering a synthetic dataset for future explorations into automatic self-correction guideline generation.

### Fast and Slow Gradient Approximation for Binary Neural Network   Optimization
**Authors**: Xinquan Chen, Junqi Gao, Biqing Qi, Dong Li, Yiang Luo, Fangyuan Li, Pengfei Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:48:40Z

**Summary**: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their immense potential for deployment on edge devices. However, the non-differentiability of the quantization function poses a challenge for the optimization of BNNs, as its derivative cannot be backpropagated. To address this issue, hypernetwork based methods, which utilize neural networks to learn the gradients of non-differentiable quantization functions, have emerged as a promising approach due to their adaptive learning capabilities to reduce estimation errors. However, existing hypernetwork based methods typically rely solely on current gradient information, neglecting the influence of historical gradients. This oversight can lead to accumulated gradient errors when calculating gradient momentum during optimization. To incorporate historical gradient information, we design a Historical Gradient Storage (HGS) module, which models the historical gradient sequence to generate the first-order momentum required for optimization. To further enhance gradient generation in hypernetworks, we propose a Fast and Slow Gradient Generation (FSG) method. Additionally, to produce more precise gradients, we introduce Layer Recognition Embeddings (LRE) into the hypernetwork, facilitating the generation of layer-specific fine gradients. Extensive comparative experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence and lower loss values, outperforming existing baselines.Code is available at http://github.com/two-tiger/FSG .

### EACO: Enhancing Alignment in Multimodal LLMs via Critical Observation
**Authors**: Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:47:29Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.

### No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need
**Authors**: Minghao Xu, Lichuan Xiang, Xu Cai, Hongkai Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:41:37Z

**Summary**: In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings.

### What Matters in Learning A Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real RL Policy for Quadrotor   Control? A Comprehensive Study
**Authors**: Jiayu Chen, Chao Yu, Yuqing Xie, Feng Gao, Yinuo Chen, Shu'ang Yu, Wenhao Tang, Shilong Ji, Mo Mu, Yi Wu, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:31:26Z

**Summary**: Executing precise and agile flight maneuvers is critical for quadrotors in various applications. Traditional quadrotor control approaches are limited by their reliance on flat trajectories or time-consuming optimization, which restricts their flexibility. Recently, RL-based policy has emerged as a promising alternative due to its ability to directly map observations to actions, reducing the need for detailed system knowledge and actuation constraints. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the sim-to-real gap, where RL-based policies often experience instability when deployed in real world. In this paper, we investigate key factors for learning robust RL-based control policies that are capable of zero-shot deployment in real-world quadrotors. We identify five critical factors and we develop a PPO-based training framework named SimpleFlight, which integrates these five techniques. We validate the efficacy of SimpleFlight on Crazyflie quadrotor, demonstrating that it achieves more than a 50% reduction in trajectory tracking error compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines, and achieves 70% improvement over the traditional MPC. The policy derived by SimpleFlight consistently excels across both smooth polynominal trajectories and challenging infeasible zigzag trajectories on small thrust-to-weight quadrotors. In contrast, baseline methods struggle with high-speed or infeasible trajectories. To support further research and reproducibility, we integrate SimpleFlight into a GPU-based simulator Omnidrones and provide open-source access to the code and model checkpoints. We hope SimpleFlight will offer valuable insights for advancing RL-based quadrotor control. For more details, visit our project website at https://sites.google.com/view/simpleflight/.

**Authors**: Mohammad Aflah Khan, Neemesh Yadav, Sarah Masud, Md. Shad Akhtar

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:28:29Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a need for advanced benchmarking systems beyond traditional setups. To this end, we introduce QUENCH, a novel text-based English Quizzing Benchmark manually curated and transcribed from YouTube quiz videos. QUENCH possesses masked entities and rationales for the LLMs to predict via generation. At the intersection of geographical context and common sense reasoning, QUENCH helps assess world knowledge and deduction capabilities of LLMs via a zero-shot, open-domain quizzing setup. We perform an extensive evaluation on 7 LLMs and 4 metrics, investigating the influence of model size, prompting style, geographical context, and gold-labeled rationale generation. The benchmarking concludes with an error analysis to which the LLMs are prone.

**Authors**: Timothée Anne, Noah Syrkis, Meriem Elhosni, Florian Turati, Franck Legendre, Alain Jaquier, Sebastian Risi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:25:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. A promising but largely under-explored area is their potential to facilitate human coordination with many agents. Such capabilities would be useful in domains including disaster response, urban planning, and real-time strategy scenarios. In this work, we introduce (1) a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities and (2) a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 2,000 agents using natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with our hybrid approach solving tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and strategic points. However, our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing spatial visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans. This work sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in human-swarm coordination, paving the way for future research in this area. The HIVE project page, which includes videos of the system in action, can be found here: hive.syrkis.com.

**Authors**: Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:01:53Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

**Authors**: Tianhao Li, Jingyu Lu, Chuangxin Chu, Tianyu Zeng, Yujia Zheng, Mei Li, Haotian Huang, Bin Wu, Zuoxian Liu, Kai Ma, Xuejing Yuan, Xingkai Wang, Keyan Ding, Huajun Chen, Qiang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:57:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have a transformative impact on a variety of scientific tasks across disciplines including biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics. However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily focusing on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such as molecular, protein, and genomic languages. Moreover, the safety mechanisms of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks. SciSafeEval spans multiple scientific languages-including textual, molecular, protein, and genomic-and covers a wide range of scientific domains. We evaluate LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a "jailbreak" enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention. Our benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in scientific contexts. This work aims to facilitate the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards in scientific research.

### Personalized LLM for Generating Customized Responses to the Same Query   from Different Users
**Authors**: Hang Zeng, Chaoyue Niu, Fan Wu, Chengfei Lv, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:57:19Z

**Summary**: Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLM, but overlooked the diversity of questioners. In this work, we propose a new form of questioner-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different questioners. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-questioner general encoder and a questioner-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same questioner, while pulling apart those of different questioners. To mitigate the impact of question diversity on questioner-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on question similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. We also build a multi-questioner dataset from English and Chinese scripts and WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 questioners and 12 responders. Extensive evaluation with different metrics shows a significant improvement in the quality of personalized response generation.

### GenderAlign: An Alignment Dataset for Mitigating Gender Bias in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Tao Zhang, Ziqian Zeng, Yuxiang Xiao, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen, James Foulds, Shimei Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:51:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that exhibits gender biases, raising significant ethical concerns. Alignment, the process of fine-tuning LLMs to better align with desired behaviors, is recognized as an effective approach to mitigate gender biases. Although proprietary LLMs have made significant strides in mitigating gender bias, their alignment datasets are not publicly available. The commonly used and publicly available alignment dataset, HH-RLHF, still exhibits gender bias to some extent. There is a lack of publicly available alignment datasets specifically designed to address gender bias. Hence, we developed a new dataset named GenderAlign, aiming at mitigating a comprehensive set of gender biases in LLMs. This dataset comprises 8k single-turn dialogues, each paired with a "chosen" and a "rejected" response. Compared to the "rejected" responses, the "chosen" responses demonstrate lower levels of gender bias and higher quality. Furthermore, we categorized the gender biases in the "rejected" responses of GenderAlign into 4 principal categories. The experimental results show the effectiveness of GenderAlign in reducing gender bias in LLMs.

### Selective Forgetting: Advancing Machine Unlearning Techniques and   Evaluation in Language Models
**Authors**: Lingzhi Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Jinsong Guo, Kam-Fai Wong, Georg Gottlob

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:44:07Z

**Summary**: This paper explores Machine Unlearning (MU), an emerging field that is gaining increased attention due to concerns about neural models unintentionally remembering personal or sensitive information. We present SeUL, a novel method that enables selective and fine-grained unlearning for language models. Unlike previous work that employs a fully reversed training objective in unlearning, SeUL minimizes the negative impact on the capability of language models, particularly in terms of generation. Furthermore, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics, sensitive extraction likelihood (S-EL) and sensitive memorization accuracy (S-MA), specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of forgetting sensitive information. In support of the unlearning framework, we propose efficient automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods. The online selection method, based on language probability scores, ensures computational efficiency, while the offline annotation involves a two-stage LLM-based process for robust verification. In summary, this paper contributes a novel selective unlearning method (SeUL), introduces specialized evaluation metrics (S-EL and S-MA) for assessing sensitive information forgetting, and proposes automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods to support the overall unlearning framework and evaluation process.

**Authors**: Zhuoyun Du, Lujie Zheng, Renjun Hu, Yuyang Xu, Xiawei Li, Ying Sun, Wei Chen, Jian Wu, Haolei Cai, Haohao Ying

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:36:47Z

**Summary**: Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Most research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulated patients focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability. The code will be available at https://github.com/ZJUMAI/EvoPatient.

### Seeker: Towards Exception Safety Code Generation with Intermediate   Language Agents Framework
**Authors**: Xuanming Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Yiming Zheng, Zhexin Zhang, Yuan Yuan, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:35:29Z

**Summary**: In real world software development, improper or missing exception handling can severely impact the robustness and reliability of code. Exception handling mechanisms require developers to detect, capture, and manage exceptions according to high standards, but many developers struggle with these tasks, leading to fragile code. This problem is particularly evident in open-source projects and impacts the overall quality of the software ecosystem. To address this challenge, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to improve exception handling in code. Through extensive analysis, we identify three key issues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception Block, and Distorted Handling Solution. These problems are widespread across real world repositories, suggesting that robust exception handling practices are often overlooked or mishandled. In response, we propose Seeker, a multi-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception handling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to enhance exception handling practices in real development scenarios, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability.

### MiMoTable: A Multi-scale Spreadsheet Benchmark with Meta Operations for   Table Reasoning
**Authors**: Zheng Li, Yang Du, Mao Zheng, Mingyang Song

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:33:12Z

**Summary**: Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for table reasoning and has significantly improved the performance on existing benchmarks. However, tables and user questions in real-world applications are more complex and diverse, presenting an unignorable gap compared to the existing benchmarks. To fill the gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ult\textbf{i}-scale spreadsheet benchmark with \textbf{M}eta \textbf{o}perations for \textbf{Table} reasoning, named as MiMoTable. Specifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in MiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven domains and contain different types. Second, we define a new criterion with six categories of meta operations for measuring the difficulty of each question in MiMoTable, simultaneously as a new perspective for measuring the difficulty of the existing benchmarks. Experimental results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the best performance with 77.4\% accuracy, indicating that there is still significant room to improve for LLMs on MiMoTable. Furthermore, we grade the difficulty of existing benchmarks according to our new criteria. Experiments have shown that the performance of LLMs decreases as the difficulty of benchmarks increases, thereby proving the effectiveness of our proposed new criterion.

### CoinMath: Harnessing the Power of Coding Instruction for Math LLMs
**Authors**: Chengwei Wei, Bin Wang, Jung-jae Kim, Guimei Liu, Nancy F. Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:21:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in solving mathematical problems, with code-based solutions proving particularly effective. However, the best practice to leverage coding instruction data to enhance mathematical reasoning remains underexplored. This study investigates three key questions: (1) How do different coding styles of mathematical code-based rationales impact LLMs' learning performance? (2) Can general-domain coding instructions improve performance? (3) How does integrating textual rationales with code-based ones during training enhance mathematical reasoning abilities? Our findings reveal that code-based rationales with concise comments, descriptive naming, and hardcoded solutions are beneficial, while improvements from general-domain coding instructions and textual rationales are relatively minor. Based on these insights, we propose CoinMath, a learning strategy designed to enhance mathematical reasoning by diversifying the coding styles of code-based rationales. CoinMath generates a variety of code-based rationales incorporating concise comments, descriptive naming conventions, and hardcoded solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that CoinMath significantly outperforms its baseline model, MAmmoTH, one of the SOTA math LLMs.

**Authors**: Matteo Esposito, Francesco Palagiano, Valentina Lenarduzzi, Davide Taibi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:21:05Z

**Summary**: Context. The security of critical infrastructure has been a fundamental concern since the advent of computers, and this concern has only intensified in today's cyber warfare landscape. Protecting mission-critical systems (MCSs), including essential assets like healthcare, telecommunications, and military coordination, is vital for national security. These systems require prompt and comprehensive governance to ensure their resilience, yet recent events have shown that meeting these demands is increasingly challenging. Aim. Building on prior research that demonstrated the potential of GAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in improving risk analysis tasks, we aim to explore practitioners' perspectives, specifically developers and security personnel, on using generative AI (GAI) in the governance of IT MCSs seeking to provide insights and recommendations for various stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Method. We designed a survey to collect practical experiences, concerns, and expectations of practitioners who develop and implement security solutions in the context of MCSs. Analyzing this data will help identify key trends, challenges, and opportunities for introducing GAIs in this niche domain. Conclusions and Future Works. Our findings highlight that the safe use of LLMs in MCS governance requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers should focus on designing regulation-oriented models and focus on accountability; practitioners emphasize data protection and transparency, while policymakers must establish a unified AI framework with global benchmarks to ensure ethical and secure LLMs-based MCS governance.

### A More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Approach Based on   LLM-Based Agents and Graphs
**Authors**: Zixin Liu, Ji Zhang, Yiran Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:13:49Z

**Summary**: Group polarization is an important research direction in social media content analysis, attracting many researchers to explore this field. Therefore, how to effectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring group polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not yet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group polarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses a significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts often contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and internet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic analysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we designed a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states. Furthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI) based on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding results. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of usability, accuracy, and interpretability.

### L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Hyesung Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-joon Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:06:53Z

**Summary**: Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces inference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained significant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into quantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while minimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous quantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantization (PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss. Meanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost comparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully quantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution. Using the LLaMA and Mistral models with instructional datasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot learning.

### TRIM: Token Reduction and Inference Modeling for Cost-Effective Language   Generation
**Authors**: Alfredo Garrachón Ruiz, Tomás de la Rosa, Daniel Borrajo

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:06:25Z

**Summary**: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a significant challenge due to their computational demands, specially on tasks requiring long outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.

### P$^2$ Law: Scaling Law for Post-Training After Model Pruning
**Authors**: Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Xiaokang Zhang, Yanling Wang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:00:34Z

**Summary**: Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for reducing the hardware requirements of large language models (LLMs). To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data.Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling \textbf{Law} for \textbf{P}ost-training after model \textbf{P}runing, referred to as the P$^2$ Law.This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P$^2$ Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs.

### Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite   Pixel Learning
**Authors**: Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:55:26Z

**Summary**: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

### Against All Odds: Overcoming Typology, Script, and Language Confusion in   Multilingual Embedding Inversion Attacks
**Authors**: Yiyi Chen, Russa Biswas, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:53:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks.

### Multimodal LLM for Intelligent Transportation Systems
**Authors**: Dexter Le, Aybars Yunusoglu, Karn Tiwari, Murat Isik, I. Can Dikmen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:50:30Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of transportation systems, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising frontier for advancing intelligent decision-making across various applications. This paper introduces a novel 3-dimensional framework that encapsulates the intersection of applications, machine learning methodologies, and hardware devices, particularly emphasizing the role of LLMs. Instead of using multiple machine learning algorithms, our framework uses a single, data-centric LLM architecture that can analyze time series, images, and videos. We explore how LLMs can enhance data interpretation and decision-making in transportation. We apply this LLM framework to different sensor datasets, including time-series data and visual data from sources like Oxford Radar RobotCar, D-Behavior (D-Set), nuScenes by Motional, and Comma2k19. The goal is to streamline data processing workflows, reduce the complexity of deploying multiple models, and make intelligent transportation systems more efficient and accurate. The study was conducted using state-of-the-art hardware, leveraging the computational power of AMD RTX 3060 GPUs and Intel i9-12900 processors. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an average accuracy of 91.33\% across these datasets, with the highest accuracy observed in time-series data (92.7\%), showcasing the model's proficiency in handling sequential information essential for tasks such as motion planning and predictive maintenance. Through our exploration, we demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of LLMs in handling multimodal data within the transportation sector, ultimately providing insights into their application in real-world scenarios. Our findings align with the broader conference themes, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in advancing transportation technologies.

**Authors**: Ryan Sze-Yin Chan, Federico Nanni, Angus R. Williams, Edwin Brown, Liam Burke-Moore, Ed Chapman, Kate Onslow, Tvesha Sippy, Jonathan Bright, Evelina Gabasova

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:26:21Z

**Summary**: Recent surge in Large Language Model (LLM) availability has opened exciting avenues for research. However, efficiently interacting with these models presents a significant hurdle since LLMs often reside on proprietary or self-hosted API endpoints, each requiring custom code for interaction. Conducting comparative studies between different models can therefore be time-consuming and necessitate significant engineering effort, hindering research efficiency and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we present prompto, an open source Python library which facilitates asynchronous querying of LLM endpoints enabling researchers to interact with multiple LLMs concurrently, while maximising efficiency and utilising individual rate limits. Our library empowers researchers and developers to interact with LLMs more effectively and allowing faster experimentation, data generation and evaluation. prompto is released with an introductory video (https://youtu.be/lWN9hXBOLyQ) under MIT License and is available via GitHub (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/prompto).

### LLM-DaaS: LLM-driven Drone-as-a-Service Operations from Text User   Requests
**Authors**: Lillian Wassim, Kamal Mohamed, Ali Hamdi

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:25:56Z

**Summary**: We propose LLM-DaaS, a novel Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform free-text user requests into structured, actionable DaaS operation tasks. Our approach addresses the key challenge of interpreting and structuring natural language input to automate drone service operations under uncertain conditions. The system is composed of three main components: free-text request processing, structured request generation, and dynamic DaaS selection and composition. First, we fine-tune different LLM models such as Phi-3.5, LLaMA-3.2 7b and Gemma 2b on a dataset of text user requests mapped to structured DaaS requests. Users interact with our model in a free conversational style, discussing package delivery requests, while the fine-tuned LLM extracts DaaS metadata such as delivery time, source and destination locations, and package weight. The DaaS service selection model is designed to select the best available drone capable of delivering the requested package from the delivery point to the nearest optimal destination. Additionally, the DaaS composition model composes a service from a set of the best available drones to deliver the package from the source to the final destination. Second, the system integrates real-time weather data to optimize drone route planning and scheduling, ensuring safe and efficient operations. Simulations demonstrate the system's ability to significantly improve task accuracy, operational efficiency, and establish LLM-DaaS as a robust solution for DaaS operations in uncertain environments.

### How Reliable are LLMs as Knowledge Bases? Re-thinking Facutality and   Consistency
**Authors**: Danna Zheng, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:23:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as knowledge bases (KBs), yet current evaluation methods focus too narrowly on knowledge retention, overlooking other crucial criteria for reliable performance. In this work, we rethink the requirements for evaluating reliable LLM-as-KB usage and highlight two essential factors: factuality, ensuring accurate responses to seen and unseen knowledge, and consistency, maintaining stable answers to questions about the same knowledge. We introduce UnseenQA, a dataset designed to assess LLM performance on unseen knowledge, and propose new criteria and metrics to quantify factuality and consistency, leading to a final reliability score. Our experiments on 26 LLMs reveal several challenges regarding their use as KBs, underscoring the need for more principled and comprehensive evaluation.

### CEM: A Data-Efficient Method for Large Language Models to Continue   Evolving From Mistakes
**Authors**: Haokun Zhao, Haixia Han, Jie Shi, Chengyu Du, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:21:30Z

**Summary**: As world knowledge advances and new task schemas emerge, Continual Learning (CL) becomes essential for keeping Large Language Models (LLMs) current and addressing their shortcomings. This process typically involves continual instruction tuning (CIT) and continual pre-training (CPT) to enable these models to adapt to novel tasks and acquire critical knowledge. However, collecting sufficient CPT data and efficiently bridging knowledge gaps remain significant challenges. Inspired by the 'summarizing mistakes' strategy, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, a data-efficient approach aiming to collect CPT data and continually improve LLMs' performance through iterative evaluation and supplementation with mistake-relevant knowledge. To further optimize data usage and mitigate forgetting, we introduce a novel training paradigm that combines CIT and CPT. Experiments show that CEM substantially enhances multiple models' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA tasks, achieving gains of up to 29.63%. Code and datasets are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cem-BB25.

### C3oT: Generating Shorter Chain-of-Thought without Compromising   Effectiveness
**Authors**: Yu Kang, Xianghui Sun, Liangyu Chen, Wei Zou

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:12:45Z

**Summary**: Generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before deriving the answer can effectively improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and significantly improve the accuracy of the generated answer. However, in most cases, the length of the generated CoT is much longer than the desired final answer, which results in additional decoding costs. Furthermore, existing research has discovered that shortening the reasoning steps in CoT, even while preserving the key information, diminishes LLMs' abilities. These phenomena make it difficult to use LLMs and CoT in many real-world applications that only require the final answer and are sensitive to latency, such as search and recommendation. To reduce the costs of model decoding and shorten the length of the generated CoT, this paper presents $\textbf{C}$onditioned $\textbf{C}$ompressed $\textbf{C}$hain-of-$\textbf{T}$hought (C3oT), a CoT compression framework that involves a compressor to compress an original longer CoT into a shorter CoT while maintaining key information and interpretability, a conditioned training method to train LLMs with both longer CoT and shorter CoT simultaneously to learn the corresponding relationships between them, and a conditioned inference method to gain the reasoning ability learned from longer CoT by generating shorter CoT. We conduct experiments over four datasets from arithmetic and commonsense scenarios, showing that the proposed method is capable of compressing the length of generated CoT by up to more than 50% without compromising its effectiveness.

### Steering Language Models with Game-Theoretic Solvers
**Authors**: Ian Gemp, Roma Patel, Yoram Bachrach, Marc Lanctot, Vibhavari Dasagi, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Siqi Liu, Karl Tuyls

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:03:31Z

**Summary**: Mathematical models of interactions among rational agents have long been studied in game theory. However these interactions are often over a small set of discrete game actions which is very different from how humans communicate in natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework that allows equilibrium solvers to work over the space of natural language dialogue generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by modelling the players, strategies and payoffs in a "game" of dialogue, we create a binding from natural language interactions to the conventional symbolic logic of game theory. Given this binding, we can ask existing game-theoretic algorithms to provide us with strategic solutions (e.g., what string an LLM should generate to maximize payoff in the face of strategic partners or opponents), giving us predictors of stable, rational conversational strategies. We focus on three domains that require different negotiation strategies: scheduling meetings, trading fruit and debate, and evaluate an LLM's generated language when guided by solvers. We see that LLMs that follow game-theory solvers result in dialogue generations that are less exploitable than the control (no guidance from solvers), and the language generated results in higher rewards, in all negotiation domains. We discuss future implications of this work, and how game-theoretic solvers that can leverage the expressivity of natural language can open up a new avenue of guiding language research.

### Private Yet Social: How LLM Chatbots Support and Challenge Eating   Disorder Recovery
**Authors**: Ryuhaerang Choi, Taehan Kim, Subin Park, Jennifer G Kim, Sung-Ju Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:59:49Z

**Summary**: Eating disorders (ED) are complex mental health conditions that require long-term management and support. Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based chatbots offer the potential to assist individuals in receiving immediate support. Yet, concerns remain about their reliability and safety in sensitive contexts such as ED. We explore the opportunities and potential harms of using LLM-based chatbots for ED recovery. We observe the interactions between 26 participants with ED and an LLM-based chatbot, WellnessBot, designed to support ED recovery, over 10 days. We discovered that our participants have felt empowered in recovery by discussing ED-related stories with the chatbot, which served as a personal yet social avenue. However, we also identified harmful chatbot responses, especially concerning individuals with ED, that went unnoticed partly due to participants' unquestioning trust in the chatbot's reliability. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for safe and effective LLM-based interventions in ED management.

### SAM Decoding: Speculative Decoding via Suffix Automaton
**Authors**: Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:48:28Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) has been demonstrated as an effective technique for lossless LLM inference acceleration. Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of model-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on incomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are constrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text sequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is $18\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of $3.28\%$ -- $11.13\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones. Our code is available at our \href{https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding}{repository}.

### Align$^2$LLaVA: Cascaded Human and Large Language Model Preference   Alignment for Multi-modal Instruction Curation
**Authors**: Hongzhe Huang, Jiang Liu, Zhewen Yu, Li Cai, Dian Jiao, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Juncheng Li, Hao Jiang, Haoyuan Li, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:33:44Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as LLaVA-series models, are driven by massive machine-generated instruction-following data tuning. Such automatic instruction collection pipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data quality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived from two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress this vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and high-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a machine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data quality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model was trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human understanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment, given the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the inner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with that of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model performance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%. Impressively, by aggressively reducing the training instructions from 158k to 14k (9$\times$ smaller), our model consistently outperforms its full-size dataset counterpart across various MLLM benchmarks. Our project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/Align2LLaVA.

### QPruner: Probabilistic Decision Quantization for Structured Pruning in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Changhai Zhou, Yuhua Zhou, Shijie Han, Qian Qiao, Hongguang Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:14:01Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the resource demands of these models pose substantial challenges. Structured pruning is an effective approach to reducing model size, but it often results in significant accuracy degradation, necessitating parameter updates to adapt. Unfortunately, such fine-tuning requires substantial memory, which limits its applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce quantization into the structured pruning framework to reduce memory consumption during both fine-tuning and inference. However, the combined errors from pruning and quantization increase the difficulty of fine-tuning, requiring a more refined quantization scheme. To this end, we propose QPruner, a novel framework that employs structured pruning to reduce model size, followed by a layer-wise mixed-precision quantization scheme. Quantization precisions are assigned to each layer based on their importance to the target task, and Bayesian optimization is employed to refine precision allocation strategies, ensuring a balance between model accuracy and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that QPruner significantly outperforms existing methods in memory savings while maintaining or improving model performance.

### Fool Me, Fool Me: User Attitudes Toward LLM Falsehoods
**Authors**: Diana Bar-Or Nirman, Ariel Weizman, Amos Azaria

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:10:27Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central tools in various fields, they often provide inaccurate or false information. This study examines user preferences regarding falsehood responses from LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate preferences for LLM responses where false statements are explicitly marked versus unmarked responses and preferences for confident falsehoods compared to LLM disclaimers acknowledging a lack of knowledge. Additionally, we investigate how requiring users to assess the truthfulness of statements influences these preferences.   Surprisingly, 61\% of users prefer unmarked falsehood responses over marked ones, and 69\% prefer confident falsehoods over LLMs admitting lack of knowledge. In all our experiments, a total of 300 users participated, contributing valuable data to our analysis and conclusions. When users are required to evaluate the truthfulness of statements, preferences for unmarked and falsehood responses decrease slightly but remain high. These findings suggest that user preferences, which influence LLM training via feedback mechanisms, may inadvertently encourage the generation of falsehoods. Future research should address the ethical and practical implications of aligning LLM behavior with such preferences.

### PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase   Detection Models
**Authors**: Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:09:23Z

**Summary**: The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this, we create PARAPHRASUS, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment, benchmarking and selection of paraphrase detection models. We find that paraphrase detection models under our fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset. Furthermore, PARAPHRASUS allows prompt calibration for different use cases, tailoring LLM models to specific strictness levels. PARAPHRASUS includes 3 challenges spanning over 10 datasets, including 8 repurposed and 2 newly annotated; we release it along with a benchmarking library at https://github.com/impresso/paraphrasus

### VG-TVP: Multimodal Procedural Planning via Visually Grounded Text-Video   Prompting
**Authors**: Muhammet Furkan Ilaslan, Ali Koksal, Kevin Qinhong Lin, Burak Satar, Mike Zheng Shou, Qianli Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:08:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in procedural tasks, but the potential of multimodal instructions augmented by texts and videos to assist users remains under-explored. To address this gap, we propose the Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel LLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework. It generates cohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level objective. The main challenges are achieving textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans. VG-TVP leverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text generation ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video generation ability of diffusion models. VG-TVP improves the interaction between modalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using Text-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B). They allow LLMs to guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded video plans. To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have curated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP). We conduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences (regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan accuracy). Our VG-TVP method outperforms unimodal baselines on the Daily-PP dataset.

### EvoLlama: Enhancing LLMs' Understanding of Proteins via Multimodal   Structure and Sequence Representations
**Authors**: Nuowei Liu, Changzhi Sun, Tao Ji, Junfeng Tian, Jianxin Tang, Yuanbin Wu, Man Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T10:01:33Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) for understanding proteins primarily treats amino acid sequences as a text modality. Meanwhile, Protein Language Models (PLMs), such as ESM-2, have learned massive sequential evolutionary knowledge from the universe of natural protein sequences. Furthermore, structure-based encoders like ProteinMPNN learn the structural information of proteins through Graph Neural Networks. However, whether the incorporation of protein encoders can enhance the protein understanding of LLMs has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose EvoLlama, a multimodal framework that connects a structure-based encoder, a sequence-based protein encoder and an LLM for protein understanding. EvoLlama consists of a ProteinMPNN structure encoder, an ESM-2 protein sequence encoder, a multimodal projector to align protein and text representations and a Llama-3 text decoder. To train EvoLlama, we fine-tune it on protein-oriented instructions and protein property prediction datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates. Our experiments show that EvoLlama's protein understanding capabilities have been significantly enhanced, outperforming other fine-tuned protein-oriented LLMs in zero-shot settings by an average of 1%-8% and surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline with supervised fine-tuning by an average of 6%. On protein property prediction datasets, our approach achieves promising results that are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. We will release our code in a future version.

### MT-LENS: An all-in-one Toolkit for Better Machine Translation Evaluation
**Authors**: Javier García Gilabert, Carlos Escolano, Audrey Mash, Xixian Liao, Maite Melero

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T09:57:28Z

**Summary**: We introduce MT-LENS, a framework designed to evaluate Machine Translation (MT) systems across a variety of tasks, including translation quality, gender bias detection, added toxicity, and robustness to misspellings. While several toolkits have become very popular for benchmarking the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing evaluation tools often lack the ability to thoroughly assess the diverse aspects of MT performance. MT-LENS addresses these limitations by extending the capabilities of LM-eval-harness for MT, supporting state-of-the-art datasets and a wide range of evaluation metrics. It also offers a user-friendly platform to compare systems and analyze translations with interactive visualizations. MT-LENS aims to broaden access to evaluation strategies that go beyond traditional translation quality evaluation, enabling researchers and engineers to better understand the performance of a NMT model and also easily measure system's biases.

### Text Proxy: Decomposing Retrieval from a 1-to-N Relationship into N   1-to-1 Relationships for Text-Video Retrieval
**Authors**: Jian Xiao, Zhenzhen Hu, Jia Li, Richang Hong

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T09:52:32Z

**Summary**: Text-video retrieval (TVR) has seen substantial advancements in recent years, fueled by the utilization of pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, achieving accurate matching in TVR remains challenging due to inherent disparities between video and textual modalities and irregularities in data representation. In this paper, we propose Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the conventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships. By replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not only broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each text proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by mechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's direction and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only facilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the disparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three representative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an improvement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline. TV-ProxyNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions, and a 2.0% improvement on DiDeMo compared to existing methods, validating our approach's ability to enhance semantic mapping and reduce error propensity.

### SPaR: Self-Play with Tree-Search Refinement to Improve   Instruction-Following in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiale Cheng, Xiao Liu, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yida Lu, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T09:47:43Z

**Summary**: Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output. Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning. However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs. Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions. By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations. Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities. Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability and transferability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B. We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SPaR.

### Aligning Visual and Semantic Interpretability through Visually Grounded   Concept Bottleneck Models
**Authors**: Patrick Knab, Katharina Prasse, Sascha Marton, Christian Bartelt, Margret Keuper

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T09:04:58Z

**Summary**: The performance of neural networks increases steadily, but our understanding of their decision-making lags behind. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this issue by incorporating human-understandable concepts into the prediction process, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability. Since existing approaches often rely on large language models (LLMs) to infer concepts, their results may contain inaccurate or incomplete mappings, especially in complex visual domains. We introduce visually Grounded Concept Bottleneck Models (GCBM), which derive concepts on the image level using segmentation and detection foundation models. Our method generates inherently interpretable concepts, which can be grounded in the input image using attribution methods, allowing interpretations to be traced back to the image plane. We show that GCBM concepts are meaningful interpretability vehicles, which aid our understanding of model embedding spaces. GCBMs allow users to control the granularity, number, and naming of concepts, providing flexibility and are easily adaptable to new datasets without pre-training or additional data needed. Prediction accuracy is within 0.3-6% of the linear probe and GCBMs perform especially well for fine-grained classification interpretability on CUB, due to their dataset specificity. Our code is available on https://github.com/KathPra/GCBM.

### Prompt Valuation Based on Shapley Values
**Authors**: Hanxi Liu, Xiaokai Mao, Haocheng Xia, Jian Lou, Jinfei Liu, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:57:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel on new tasks without additional training, simply by providing natural language prompts that demonstrate how the task should be performed. Prompt ensemble methods comprehensively harness the knowledge of LLMs while mitigating individual biases and errors and further enhancing performance. However, more prompts do not necessarily lead to better results, and not all prompts are beneficial. A small number of high-quality prompts often outperform many low-quality prompts. Currently, there is a lack of a suitable method for evaluating the impact of prompts on the results. In this paper, we utilize the Shapley value to fairly quantify the contributions of prompts, helping to identify beneficial or detrimental prompts, and potentially guiding prompt valuation in data markets. Through extensive experiments employing various ensemble methods and utility functions on diverse tasks, we validate the effectiveness of using the Shapley value method for prompts as it effectively distinguishes and quantifies the contributions of each prompt.

### The Role of Natural Language Processing Tasks in Automatic Literary   Character Network Construction
**Authors**: Arthur Amalvy, Vincent Labatut, Richard Dufour

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:46:53Z

**Summary**: The automatic extraction of character networks from literary texts is generally carried out using natural language processing (NLP) cascading pipelines. While this approach is widespread, no study exists on the impact of low-level NLP tasks on their performance. In this article, we conduct such a study on a literary dataset, focusing on the role of named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution when extracting co-occurrence networks. To highlight the impact of these tasks' performance, we start with gold-standard annotations, progressively add uniformly distributed errors, and observe their impact in terms of character network quality. We demonstrate that NER performance depends on the tested novel and strongly affects character detection. We also show that NER-detected mentions alone miss a lot of character co-occurrences, and that coreference resolution is needed to prevent this. Finally, we present comparison points with 2 methods based on large language models (LLMs), including a fully end-to-end one, and show that these models are outperformed by traditional NLP pipelines in terms of recall.

### Intention Analysis Makes LLMs A Good Jailbreak Defender
**Authors**: Yuqi Zhang, Liang Ding, Lefei Zhang, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:43:24Z

**Summary**: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, particularly when facing complex and stealthy jailbreak attacks, presents a formidable challenge. Unfortunately, existing methods often overlook this intrinsic nature of jailbreaks, which limits their effectiveness in such complex scenarios. In this study, we present a simple yet highly effective defense strategy, i.e., Intention Analysis ($\mathbb{IA}$). $\mathbb{IA}$ works by triggering LLMs' inherent self-correct and improve ability through a two-stage process: 1) analyzing the essential intention of the user input, and 2) providing final policy-aligned responses based on the first round conversation. Notably, $\mathbb{IA}$ is an inference-only method, thus could enhance LLM safety without compromising their helpfulness. Extensive experiments on varying jailbreak benchmarks across a wide range of LLMs show that $\mathbb{IA}$ could consistently and significantly reduce the harmfulness in responses (averagely -48.2% attack success rate). Encouragingly, with our $\mathbb{IA}$, Vicuna-7B even outperforms GPT-3.5 regarding attack success rate. We empirically demonstrate that, to some extent, $\mathbb{IA}$ is robust to errors in generated intentions. Further analyses reveal the underlying principle of $\mathbb{IA}$: suppressing LLM's tendency to follow jailbreak prompts, thereby enhancing safety.

### Enhancing Healthcare Recommendation Systems with a Multimodal LLMs-based   MOE Architecture
**Authors**: Jingyu Xu, Yang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:42:43Z

**Summary**: With the increasing availability of multimodal data, many fields urgently require advanced architectures capable of effectively integrating these diverse data sources to address specific problems. This study proposes a hybrid recommendation model that combines the Mixture of Experts (MOE) framework with large language models to enhance the performance of recommendation systems in the healthcare domain. We built a small dataset for recommending healthy food based on patient descriptions and evaluated the model's performance on several key metrics, including Precision, Recall, NDCG, and MAP@5. The experimental results show that the hybrid model outperforms the baseline models, which use MOE or large language models individually, in terms of both accuracy and personalized recommendation effectiveness. The paper finds image data provided relatively limited improvement in the performance of the personalized recommendation system, particularly in addressing the cold start problem. Then, the issue of reclassification of images also affected the recommendation results, especially when dealing with low-quality images or changes in the appearance of items, leading to suboptimal performance. The findings provide valuable insights into the development of powerful, scalable, and high-performance recommendation systems, advancing the application of personalized recommendation technologies in real-world domains such as healthcare.

### Token Prepending: A Training-Free Approach for Eliciting Better Sentence   Embeddings from LLMs

**Summary**: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.

### RankAdaptor: Hierarchical Rank Allocation for Efficient Fine-Tuning   Pruned LLMs via Performance Model

**Summary**: The efficient compression of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. However, recovering the performance of compressed LLMs remains a major challenge. The current practice in LLM compression entails the implementation of structural pruning, complemented by a recovery phase that leverages the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) algorithm. Structural pruning's uneven modification of model architecture, coupled with standard LoRA's fixed configuration allocation across layers in an online pipeline, leads to suboptimal performance in various downstream tasks for pruned models. To address this challenge, we introduce RankAdaptor, a hierarchical rank allocation method that enables efficient fine-tuning of pruned LLMs according to layerwise specific recovery requirements. We employ a performance model that conducts offline meta-learning and online incremental learning to explore optimal rank values for each layer. Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that RankAdaptor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of pruning settings and LLM architectures, with improvements ranging from 0.7\% to 5.5\%.

**Summary**: Despite the significant strides made by generative AI in just a few short years, its future progress is constrained by the challenge of building modular and robust systems. This capability has been a cornerstone of past technological revolutions, which relied on combining components to create increasingly sophisticated and reliable systems. Cars, airplanes, computers, and software consist of components-such as engines, wheels, CPUs, and libraries-that can be assembled, debugged, and replaced. A key tool for building such reliable and modular systems is specification: the precise description of the expected behavior, inputs, and outputs of each component. However, the generality of LLMs and the inherent ambiguity of natural language make defining specifications for LLM-based components (e.g., agents) both a challenging and urgent problem. In this paper, we discuss the progress the field has made so far-through advances like structured outputs, process supervision, and test-time compute-and outline several future directions for research to enable the development of modular and reliable LLM-based systems through improved specifications.

### Let your LLM generate a few tokens and you will reduce the need for   retrieval
**Authors**: Hervé Déjean

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:13:14Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate how efficiently large language models (LLM) can be trained to check whether an answer is already stored in their parametric memory. We distill an LLM-as-a-judge to compute the IK (I Know) score. We found that this method is particularly beneficial in the context of retrieval-assisted augmented generation (RAG), with a respectable accuracy of 80%. It enables a significant reduction (more than 50%) in the number of search and reranking steps required for certain data sets. We have also introduced the IK score, which serves as a useful tool for characterising datasets by facilitating the classification task. Interestingly, through the inclusion of response tokens as input, our results suggest that only about 20,000 training samples are required to achieve good performance. The central element of this work is the use of a teacher model - the LLM as a judge - to generate training data. We also assess the robustness of the IK classifier by evaluating it with various types of teachers, including both string-based methods and LLMs, with the latter providing better results.

### MQM-APE: Toward High-Quality Error Annotation Predictors with Automatic   Post-Editing in LLM Translation Evaluators
**Authors**: Qingyu Lu, Liang Ding, Kanjian Zhang, Jinxia Zhang, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:08:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential as judges for Machine Translation (MT) quality assessment, providing both scores and fine-grained feedback. Although approaches such as GEMBA-MQM have shown state-of-the-art performance on reference-free evaluation, the predicted errors do not align well with those annotated by human, limiting their interpretability as feedback signals. To enhance the quality of error annotations predicted by LLM evaluators, we introduce a universal and training-free framework, $\textbf{MQM-APE}$, based on the idea of filtering out non-impactful errors by Automatically Post-Editing (APE) the original translation based on each error, leaving only those errors that contribute to quality improvement. Specifically, we prompt the LLM to act as 1) $\textit{evaluator}$ to provide error annotations, 2) $\textit{post-editor}$ to determine whether errors impact quality improvement and 3) $\textit{pairwise quality verifier}$ as the error filter. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both the reliability and quality of error spans against GEMBA-MQM, across eight LLMs in both high- and low-resource languages. Orthogonal to trained approaches, MQM-APE complements translation-specific evaluators such as Tower, highlighting its broad applicability. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of each module and offers valuable insights into evaluator design and LLMs selection.

### GraphInsight: Unlocking Insights in Large Language Models for Graph   Structure Understanding
**Authors**: Yukun Cao, Shuo Han, Zengyi Gao, Zezhong Ding, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T08:06:27Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases. We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ''positional biases''. To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes.
