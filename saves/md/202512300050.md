**Authors**: Zhi Ouyang, Dian Zheng, Xiao-Ming Wu, Jian-Jian Jiang, Kun-Yu Lin, Jingke Meng, Wei-Shi Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:59:14Z

**Summary**: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

### BLEST: Blazingly Efficient BFS using Tensor Cores
**Authors**: Deniz Elbek, Kamer Kaya

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:30:33Z

**Summary**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph kernel that underpins a wide range of applications. While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.

### Latency-Optimal Cache-aided Multicast Streaming via Forward-Backward Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Mohsen Amidzadeh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:00:39Z

**Summary**: We consider a cellular network equipped with cache-enabled base-stations (BSs) leveraging an orthogonal multipoint multicast (OMPMC) streaming scheme. The network operates in a time-slotted fashion to serve content-requesting users by streaming cached files. The users being unsatisfied by the multicat streaming face a delivery outage, implying that they will remain interested in their preference at the next time-slot, which leads to a forward dynamics on the user preference. To design a latency-optimal streaming policy, the dynamics of latency is properly modeled and included in the learning procedure. We show that this dynamics surprisingly represents a backward dynamics. The combination of problem's forward and backward dynamics then develops a forward-backward Markov decision process (FB-MDP) that fully captures the network evolution across time. This FB-MDP necessitates usage of a forward-backward multi-objective reinforcement learning (FB-MORL) algorithm to optimize the expected latency as well as other performance metrics of interest including the overall outage probability and total resource consumption. Simulation results show the merit of proposed FB-MORL algorithm in finding a promising dynamic cache policy.

### TimeBill: Time-Budgeted Inference for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qi Fan, An Zou, Yehan Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:49:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

### Knot Forcing: Taming Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models for Real-time Infinite Interactive Portrait Animation
**Authors**: Steven Xiao, XIndi Zhang, Dechao Meng, Qi Wang, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T16:34:56Z

**Summary**: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

### PIMphony: Overcoming Bandwidth and Capacity Inefficiency in PIM-based Long-Context LLM Inference System

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T14:44:28Z

**Summary**: The expansion of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) creates significant memory system challenges. While Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is a promising accelerator, we identify that it suffers from critical inefficiencies when scaled to long contexts: severe channel underutilization, performance-limiting I/O bottlenecks, and massive memory waste from static KV cache management. In this work, we propose PIMphony, a PIM orchestrator that systematically resolves these issues with three co-designed techniques. First, Token-Centric PIM Partitioning (TCP) ensures high channel utilization regardless of batch size. Second, Dynamic PIM Command Scheduling (DCS) mitigates the I/O bottleneck by overlapping data movement and computation. Finally, a Dynamic PIM Access (DPA) controller enables dynamic memory management to eliminate static memory waste. Implemented via an MLIR-based compiler and evaluated on a cycle-accurate simulator, PIMphony significantly improves throughput for long-context LLM inference (up to 72B parameters and 1M context length). Our evaluations show performance boosts of up to 11.3x on PIM-only systems and 8.4x on xPU+PIM systems, enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world long-context applications.

### HiStream: Efficient High-Resolution Video Generation via Redundancy-Eliminated Streaming
**Authors**: Haonan Qiu, Shikun Liu, Zijian Zhou, Zhaochong An, Weiming Ren, Zhiheng Liu, Jonas Schult, Sen He, Shoufa Chen, Yuren Cong, Tao Xiang, Ziwei Liu, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T14:18:18Z

**Summary**: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

### Embedding Samples Dispatching for Recommendation Model Training in Edge Environments
**Authors**: Guopeng Li, Haisheng Tan, Chi Zhang, Hongqiu Ni, Zilong Wang, Xinyue Zhang, Yang Xu, Han Tian

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T10:23:14Z

**Summary**: Training deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) on edge workers brings several benefits, particularly in terms of data privacy protection, low latency and personalization. However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.

**Authors**: Hui Guo, Qihang Zheng, Chenghai Huo, Dongliang Guo, Haoqi Yang, Yang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T08:27:53Z

**Summary**: The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by memory architecture heterogeneity, where traditional compilers suffer from fragmented workflows and high adaptation costs. We present nncase, an open-source, end-to-end compilation framework designed to unify optimization across diverse targets. Central to nncase is an e-graph-based term rewriting engine that mitigates the phase ordering problem, enabling global exploration of computation and data movement strategies. The framework integrates three key modules: Auto Vectorize for adapting to heterogeneous computing units, Auto Distribution for searching parallel strategies with cost-aware communication optimization, and Auto Schedule for maximizing on-chip cache locality. Furthermore, a buffer-aware Codegen phase ensures efficient kernel instantiation. Evaluations show that nncase outperforms mainstream frameworks like MLC LLM and Intel IPEX on Qwen3 series models and achieves performance comparable to the hand-optimized llama.cpp on CPUs, demonstrating the viability of automated compilation for high-performance LLM deployment. The source code is available at https://github.com/kendryte/nncase.

### PhysicsCorrect: A Training-Free Approach for Stable Neural PDE Simulations
**Authors**: Xinquan Huang, Paris Perdikaris

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T05:02:40Z

**Summary**: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation: error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three representative PDE systems, including Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity demanded by practical scientific applications.

**Authors**: Xinglin Pan, Shaohuai Shi, Wenxiang Lin, Yuxin Wang, Zhenheng Tang, Wei Wang, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T03:22:03Z

**Summary**: The mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture scales model size with sublinear computational increase but suffers from memory-intensive inference due to KV caches and sparse expert activation. Recent disaggregated expert parallelism (DEP) distributes attention and experts to dedicated GPU groups but lacks support for shared experts and efficient task scheduling, limiting performance.   We propose FinDEP, a fine-grained task scheduling algorithm for DEP that maximizes task overlap to improve MoE inference throughput. FinDEP introduces three innovations: 1) partitioning computation/communication into smaller tasks for fine-grained pipelining, 2) formulating a scheduling optimization supporting variable granularity and ordering, and 3) developing an efficient solver for this large search space.   Experiments on four GPU systems with DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen3-MoE show FinDEP improves throughput by up to 1.61x over prior methods, achieving up to 1.24x speedup on a 32-GPU system.

### Demystifying ARM SME to Optimize General Matrix Multiplications
**Authors**: Chencheng Deng, Weiling Yang, Jianbin Fang, Dezun Dong

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T02:25:59Z

**Summary**: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a critical kernel in high-performance computing and deep learning. While modern architectures like ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) introduce dedicated hardware for matrix operations, existing linear algebra libraries fail to fully exploit its potential, particularly for large matrices. This paper presents MpGEMM, an open-source library that leverages key architectural features of SME to optimize GEMM across multiple precisions. Through a systematic characterization of SME, we derive optimization guidelines that inform our design. MpGEMM employs cache-aware partitioning, efficient data packing with on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels that utilize multi-vector loads and all available tile registers. Evaluated on an Apple M4 Pro with real-world workloads from DeepSeek and LLaMA, MpGEMM achieves an average speedup of 1.23x over the vendor-optimized Apple Accelerate library and significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives.

### Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors
**Authors**: Soham Ghosh, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Sadi

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:23:48Z

**Summary**: As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.

### CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:21:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/cakekv.

### V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:46:59Z

**Summary**: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.   In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

### RevFFN: Memory-Efficient Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning of Mixture-of-Experts LLMs with Reversible Blocks
**Authors**: Ningyuan Liu, Jing Yang, Kaitong Cai, Keze Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:56:58Z

**Summary**: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

### DiffusionVL: Translating Any Autoregressive Models into Diffusion Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Lunbin Zeng, Jingfeng Yao, Bencheng Liao, Hongyuan Tao, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:37:34Z

**Summary**: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

### The Silent Scholar Problem: A Probabilistic Framework for Breaking Epistemic Asymmetry in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T02:02:25Z

**Summary**: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

### Memorize-and-Generate: Towards Long-Term Consistency in Real-Time Video Generation
**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Zhirui Sun, Jingqi Tian, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T16:47:46Z

**Summary**: Frame-level autoregressive (frame-AR) models have achieved significant progress, enabling real-time video generation comparable to bidirectional diffusion models and serving as a foundation for interactive world models and game engines. However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose Memorize-and-Generate (MAG), a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks. Specifically, we train a memory model to compress historical information into a compact KV cache, and a separate generator model to synthesize subsequent frames utilizing this compressed representation. Furthermore, we introduce MAG-Bench to strictly evaluate historical memory retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAG achieves superior historical scene consistency while maintaining competitive performance on standard video generation benchmarks.

### ActionFlow: A Pipelined Action Acceleration for Vision Language Models on Edge
**Authors**: Yuntao Dai, Hang Gu, Teng Wang, Qianyu Cheng, Yifei Zheng, Zhiyong Qiu, Lei Gong, Wenqi Lou, Xuehai Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T11:29:03Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

### Memory as Resonance: A Biomimetic Architecture for Infinite Context Memory on Ergodic Phonetic Manifolds
**Authors**: Tarik Houichime, Abdelghani Souhar, Younes El Amrani

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T10:55:32Z

**Summary**: The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via "Signal Consensus" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.

### Joint Design of Embedded Index Coding and Beamforming for MIMO-based Distributed Computing via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Heekang Song, Wan Choi

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T09:49:25Z

**Summary**: In distributed computing systems, reducing the communication load during the data shuffling phase is a critical challenge, as excessive inter-node transmissions are a major performance bottleneck. One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.

### Efficient Low Rank Attention for Long-Context Inference in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tenghui Li, Guoxu Zhou, Xuyang Zhao, Yuning Qiu, Qibin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T08:47:31Z

**Summary**: As the length of input text increases, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning, reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal retention of key-value pairs. In this work, Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK) is introduced, a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and then employs these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism where only missing full-precision KV pairs are transferred, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings, while delivering significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

### Ultrahigh Charge-to-Spin Conversion and Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Quasi-Two-Dimensional d-wave Altermagnet
**Authors**: Qing Zhang, Siyun Wang, Jianting Dong, Jia Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T05:52:45Z

**Summary**: The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.

### VNF-Cache: An In-Network Key-Value Store Cache Based on Network Function Virtualization
**Authors**: Bruno E. Farias, José Flauzino, Elias P. Duarte

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T01:25:21Z

**Summary**: With the exponential growth of the amount of data available on the Internet, optimizing the response time and resource usage for data access becomes essential. Caches are an effective solution that brings data closer to clients, eliminating repetitive requests to servers. This paper presents VNF-Cache, a caching service for geographically remote key-value databases. VNF-Cache is an NFV-COIN (Network Function Virtualization-Computing In The Network) service, a technology undergoing standardization by the IETF that enables the implementation of arbitrary services directly in the network. VNF-Cache intercepts network packets, processes, stores, and sends values directly to clients when possible. Through a proof-of-concept implementation and experiments conducted with geographically dispersed servers in Brazil, the United States, and Japan, significant reductions in response time and increases in the number of requests processed per second were observed.

### PHOTON: Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Lightspeed and Memory-Efficient Language Generation
**Authors**: Yuma Ichikawa, Naoya Takagi, Takumi Nakagawa, Yuzi Kanazawa, Akira Sakai

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T19:26:59Z

**Summary**: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

### WorldWarp: Propagating 3D Geometry with Asynchronous Video Diffusion
**Authors**: Hanyang Kong, Xingyi Yang, Xiaoxu Zheng, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T18:53:50Z

**Summary**: Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

### Neutron-Assisted Breakdown Enhancement in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Diodes
**Authors**: Saleh Ahmed Khan, Sudipto Saha, Ahmed Ibreljic, Stephen Margiotta, Jiawei Liu, Walid Amir, Surajit Chakraborty, Uttam Singisetti, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T16:32:07Z

**Summary**: This study demonstrates a substantial enhancement of breakdown voltage in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky diodes through an approach that combines fast neutron irradiation with controlled post-irradiation electro-thermal annealing. Devices irradiated with 1 MeV neutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation, including a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance. Electrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V) measurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After four cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant improvements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a reduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition, approaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two cycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most thermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration, decreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first electro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the third cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3, reflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited a remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a ~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the reduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps. Subsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial recovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than pre-radiation levels.

**Summary**: The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $β$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $β$-spectrum endpoint of \SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \SI{0.2}{ppm} per \SI{1}{kV} single board and $\lesssim$ \SI{50}{mV} over the \SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \SI{0.05}{ppm} over \SI{20}{kV}.

### Hybrid Analytical-Machine Learning Framework for Ripple Factor Estimation in Cockcroft-Walton Voltage Multipliers with Residual Correction for Non-Ideal Effects
**Authors**: Md. Tanvirul Islam

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T14:32:19Z

**Summary**: Cockcroft-Walton (CW) voltage multipliers suffer from output ripple that classical analytical models underestimate due to neglected non-idealities like diode drops and capacitor ESR, particularly in high-stage, low-frequency and heavy-load regimes. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that generates a comprehensive 324-case MATLAB/Simulink dataset varying stages (2-8), input voltage (5-25 kV), capacitance (1-10 μF), frequency (50-500 Hz) and load (6-60 MΩ), then trains a Random Forest model to predict residuals between simulated and theoretical peak-to-peak ripple. The approach achieves 70.6% RMSE reduction (131 V vs. 448 V) globally and 66.7% in critical regimes, with near-zero bias, enabling physically interpretable design optimization while outperforming pure ML in extrapolation reliability.

### Learning What to Write: Write-Gated KV for Efficient Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Yen-Chieh Huang, Pi-Cheng Hsiu, Rui Fang, Ming-Syan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T10:23:36Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV .

### MixKVQ: Query-Aware Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization for Long-Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Tao Zhang, Ziqian Zeng, Hao Peng, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T09:44:26Z

**Summary**: Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), but this progress is accompanied by substantial memory and latency overhead from the extensive Key-Value (KV) cache. Although KV cache quantization is a promising compression technique, existing low-bit quantization methods often exhibit severe performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks. Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query. Based on this insight, we propose MixKVQ, a novel plug-and-play method that introduces a lightweight, query-aware algorithm to identify and preserve critical key channels that need higher precision, while applying per-token quantization for value cache. Experiments on complex reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing low-bit methods, achieving performance comparable to a full-precision baseline at a substantially reduced memory footprint.

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T04:40:04Z

**Summary**: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips. We release all models on https://huggingface.co/OPPOer.

### Memory-Efficient Training with In-Place FFT Implementation
**Authors**: Xinyu Ding, Bangtian Liu, Siyu Liao, Zhongfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T02:25:29Z

**Summary**: Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and computational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations, including standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place computation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of size n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory allocation. We propose the first real-domain, fully in-place FFT framework (rdFFT) that preserves input-output memory space consistency. By leveraging butterfly operation symmetry and conjugate properties in the frequency domain, we design an implicit complex encoding scheme that eliminates intermediate cache usage entirely. Experiments on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate the method effectiveness in reducing training memory cost, offering a promising direction for frequency-domain lightweight adaptation.

### Remoe: Towards Efficient and Low-Cost MoE Inference in Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Wentao Liu, Yuhao Hu, Ruiting Zhou, Baochun Li, Ne Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-21T10:27:50Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### JFR: An Efficient Jump Frontier Relaxation Strategy for Bellman-Ford
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T14:13:44Z

**Summary**: We propose JFR, a Bellman-Ford-based optimization framework leveraging frontier contraction and abstract multi-hop jump propagation to accelerate shortest-path computation while strictly preserving correctness. JFR achieves substantial reductions in relaxation operations, ranging from -31 to 99 percent, across sparse, dense, and negative-edge graphs, ensuring robust performance even under adversarial or highly connected topologies. On ultra-large graphs with up to N=10,000 nodes and 55,000,000 edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential.

### Theodosian: A Deep Dive into Memory-Hierarchy-Centric FHE Acceleration
**Authors**: Wonseok Choi, Hyunah Yu, Jongmin Kim, Hyesung Ji, Jaiyoung Park, Jung Ho Ahn

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T12:18:29Z

**Summary**: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, mitigating privacy concerns in cloud and edge environments. However, due to its high compute and memory demands, extensive acceleration research has been pursued across diverse hardware platforms, especially GPUs. In this paper, we perform a microarchitectural analysis of CKKS, a popular FHE scheme, on modern GPUs. We focus on on-chip cache behavior, and show that the dominant kernels remain bound by memory bandwidth despite a high-bandwidth L2 cache, exposing a persistent memory wall. We further discover that the overall CKKS pipeline throughput is constrained by low per-kernel hardware utilization, caused by insufficient intra-kernel parallelism. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Theodosian, a set of complementary, memory-aware optimizations that improve cache efficiency and reduce runtime overheads. Our approach delivers consistent speedups across various CKKS workloads. On an RTX 5090, we reduce the bootstrapping latency for 32,768 complex numbers to 15.2ms with Theodosian, and further to 12.8ms with additional algorithmic optimizations, establishing new state-of-the-art GPU performance to the best of our knowledge.

### Towards Efficient Agents: A Co-Design of Inference Architecture and System

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T12:06:13Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of large language model (LLM)-based agents has unlocked new possibilities for autonomous multi-turn reasoning and tool-augmented decision-making. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.

**Summary**: This paper studies the impact of DRAM writes on DDR5-based system. To efficiently perform DRAM writes, modern systems buffer write requests and try to complete multiple write operations whenever the DRAM mode is switched from read to write. When the DRAM system is performing writes, it is not available to service read requests, thus increasing read latency and reducing performance. We observe that, given the presence of on-die ECC in DDR5 devices, the time to perform a write operation varies significantly: from 1x (for writes to banks of different bankgroups) to 6x (for writes to banks within the same bankgroup) to 24x (for conflicting requests to the same bank). If we can orchestrate the write stream to favor write requests that incur lower latency, then we can reduce the stall time from DRAM writes and improve performance. However, for current systems, the write stream is dictated by the cache replacement policy, which makes eviction decisions without being aware of the variable latency of DRAM writes. The key insight of our work is to improve performance by modifying the cache replacement policy to increase bank-parallelism of DRAM writes.   Our paper proposes {\em BARD (Bank-Aware Replacement Decisions)}, which modifies the cache replacement policy to favor dirty lines that belong to banks without pending writes. We analyze two variants of BARD: BARD-E (Eviction-based), which changes the eviction policy to evict low-cost dirty lines, and BARD-C (Cleansing-Based), which proactively cleans low-cost dirty lines without modifying the eviction decisions. We develop a hybrid policy (BARD-H), which uses a selective combination of both eviction and writeback. Our evaluations across workloads from SPEC2017, LIGRA, STREAM, and Google server traces show that BARD-H improves performance by 4.3\% on average and up-to 8.5\%. BARD requires only 8 bytes of SRAM per LLC slice.

### TraCT: Disaggregated LLM Serving with CXL Shared Memory KV Cache at Rack-Scale
**Authors**: Dongha Yoon, Younghoon Min, Hoshik Kim, Sam H. Noh, Jongryool Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T03:42:19Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated LLM serving improves resource efficiency by separating the compute-intensive prefill phase from the latency-critical decode phase. However, this architecture introduces a fundamental bottleneck: key/value (KV) tensors generated during prefill must be transferred to decode workers, and existing systems rely on RDMA-based network paths for this exchange. As model sizes and context lengths increase, KV transfer dominates both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and peak throughput, and remains highly sensitive to network contention even when prefix reuse is high. This paper presents TraCT, a rack-scale LLM serving system that uses CXL shared memory as both a KV-transfer substrate and a rack-wide prefix-aware KV cache. TraCT enables GPUs to write and read KV blocks directly through CXL load/store and DMA operations, eliminating the NIC hop that constrains existing disaggregated pipelines. However, to realize this design, multiple new challenges such as synchronization, consistency, and data management on non-coherent CXL memory need to be addressed. TraCT proposes various software solutions such as the two-tier inter-node synchronization mechanism to address these challenges. We implement TraCT on the Dynamo LLM inference framework and show that, across static and synthetic workloads, TraCT reduces average TTFT by up to 9.8x, lowers P99 latency by up to 6.2x, and improves peak throughput by up to 1.6x compared to RDMA and DRAM-based caching baselines.

### Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live
**Authors**: Hanchen Li, Qiuyang Mang, Runyuan He, Qizheng Zhang, Huanzhi Mao, Xiaokun Chen, Hangrui Zhou, Alvin Cheung, Joseph Gonzalez, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T01:17:03Z

**Summary**: KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations.   We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase.

### Factorized Transport Alignment for Multimodal and Multiview E-commerce Representation Learning
**Authors**: Xiwen Chen, Yen-Chieh Lien, Susan Liu, María Castaños, Abolfazl Razi, Xiaoting Zhao, Congzhe Su

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T22:50:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of e-commerce requires robust multimodal representations that capture diverse signals from user-generated listings. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) typically align titles with primary images, i.e., single-view, but overlook non-primary images and auxiliary textual views that provide critical semantics in open marketplaces such as Etsy or Poshmark. To this end, we propose a framework that unifies multimodal and multi-view learning through Factorized Transport, a lightweight approximation of optimal transport, designed for scalability and deployment efficiency. During training, the method emphasizes primary views while stochastically sampling auxiliary ones, reducing training cost from quadratic in the number of views to constant per item. At inference, all views are fused into a single cached embedding, preserving the efficiency of two-tower retrieval with no additional online overhead. On an industrial dataset of 1M product listings and 0.3M interactions, our approach delivers consistent improvements in cross-view and query-to-item retrieval, achieving up to +7.9% Recall@500 over strong multimodal baselines. Overall, our framework bridges scalability with optimal transport-based learning, making multi-view pretraining practical for large-scale e-commerce search.

**Authors**: Yao Feng, Chendong Xiang, Xinyi Mao, Hengkai Tan, Zuyue Zhang, Shuhe Huang, Kaiwen Zheng, Haitian Liu, Hang Su, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T15:04:24Z

**Summary**: Robotic arm manipulation in data-scarce settings is a highly challenging task due to the complex embodiment dynamics and diverse contexts. Recent video-based approaches have shown great promise in capturing and transferring the temporal and physical interactions by pre-training on Internet-scale video data. However, such methods are often not optimized for the embodiment-specific closed-loop control, typically suffering from high latency and insufficient grounding. In this paper, we present Vidarc (Video Diffusion for Action Reasoning and Closed-loop Control), a novel autoregressive embodied video diffusion approach augmented by a masked inverse dynamics model. By grounding video predictions with action-relevant masks and incorporating real-time feedback through cached autoregressive generation, Vidarc achieves fast, accurate closed-loop control. Pre-trained on one million cross-embodiment episodes, Vidarc surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least a 15% higher success rate in real-world deployment and a 91% reduction in latency. We also highlight its robust generalization and error correction capabilities across previously unseen robotic platforms.

**Authors**: Qingxiao Sun, Tongxuan Liu, Shen Zhang, Siyu Wu, Peijun Yang, Haotian Liang, Menxin Li, Xiaolong Ma, Zhiwei Liang, Ziyi Ren, Minchao Zhang, Xinyu Liu, Ke Zhang, Depei Qian, Hailong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T11:20:16Z

**Summary**: Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

### ProCache: Constraint-Aware Feature Caching with Selective Computation for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Fanpu Cao, Yaofo Chen, Zeng You, Wei Luo, Cen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T07:27:19Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

### CodeGEMM: A Codebook-Centric Approach to Efficient GEMM in Quantized LLMs
**Authors**: Gunho Park, Jeongin Bae, Byeongwook Kim, Baeseong park, Jiwon Ryu, Hoseung Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T06:16:32Z

**Summary**: Weight-only quantization is widely used to mitigate the memory-bound nature of LLM inference. Codebook-based methods extend this trend by achieving strong accuracy in the extremely low-bit regime (e.g., 2-bit). However, current kernels rely on dequantization, which repeatedly fetches centroids and reconstructs weights, incurring substantial latency and cache pressure. We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint. The kernel supports the systematic exploration of latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs under a unified implementation. On Llama-3 models, CodeGEMM delivers 1.83x (8B) and 8.93x (70B) speedups in the 2-bit configuration compared to state-of-the-art codebook-based quantization at comparable accuracy and further improves computing efficiency and memory subsystem utilization.

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T02:09:53Z

**Summary**: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both large-scale Docker-based emulations and physical edge devices. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline solution, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing cross-network traffic by 90.72% under congested and varying network conditions.

### LLMCache: Layer-Wise Caching Strategies for Accelerated Reuse in Transformer Inference
**Authors**: Harsh Vardhan Bansal

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T18:18:57Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

### MEPIC: Memory Efficient Position Independent Caching for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Zahra Yousefijamarani, Morgan Lindsay Heisler, Rongzhi Gu, Bai Xiaolong, Shan Yizhou, Wei Zhang, Wang Lan, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T18:04:01Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.   We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

### Prefix Probing: Lightweight Harmful Content Detection for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jirui Yang, Hengqi Guo, Zhihui Lu, Yi Zhao, Yuansen Zhang, Shijing Hu, Qiang Duan, Yinggui Wang, Tao Wei

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T15:22:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

### Trainable Log-linear Sparse Attention for Efficient Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Yifan Zhou, Zeqi Xiao, Tianyi Wei, Shuai Yang, Xingang Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T14:53:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

### Live Avatar: Streaming Real-time Audio-Driven Avatar Generation with Infinite Length
**Authors**: Yubo Huang, Hailong Guo, Fangtai Wu, Shifeng Zhang, Shijie Huang, Qijun Gan, Lin Liu, Sirui Zhao, Enhong Chen, Jiaming Liu, Steven Hoi

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T13:02:34Z

**Summary**: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

### Efficient CPU-GPU Collaborative Inference for MoE-based LLMs on Memory-Limited Systems
**Authors**: En-Ming Huang, Li-Shang Lin, Chun-Yi Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T12:45:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.

### FlexKV: Flexible Index Offloading for Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Store
**Authors**: Zhisheng Hu, Jiacheng Shen, Ming-Chang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T04:03:01Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.

**Authors**: Shengling Qin, Hao Yu, Chenxin Wu, Zheng Li, Yizhong Cao, Zhengyang Zhuge, Yuxin Zhou, Wentao Yao, Yi Zhang, Zhengheng Wang, Shuai Bai, Jianwei Zhang, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T02:59:27Z

**Summary**: This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. We develop an experimental implementation of the proposed VLCache pipeline based on SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

### MultiPath Transfer Engine: Breaking GPU and Host-Memory Bandwidth Bottlenecks in LLM Services
**Authors**: Lingfeng Tang, Daoping Zhang, Junjie Chen, Peihao Huang, Feng Jin, Chengguang Xu, Yuxin Chen, Feiqiang Sun, Guo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T00:45:00Z

**Summary**: The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T21:40:17Z

**Summary**: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.

### Dynamic Rebatching for Efficient Early-Exit Inference with DREX
**Authors**: Xuting Liu, Daniel Alexander, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla, Behnaz Arzani, Vincent Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T18:55:45Z

**Summary**: Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.

### Optimizing Agentic Language Model Inference via Speculative Tool Calls
**Authors**: Daniel Nichols, Prajwal Singhania, Charles Jekel, Abhinav Bhatele, Harshitha Menon

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T18:22:44Z

**Summary**: Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly dependent on external tools. LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new "tool cache" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.

### Optimizing Bloom Filters for Modern GPU Architectures
**Authors**: Daniel Jünger, Kevin Kristensen, Yunsong Wang, Xiangyao Yu, Bertil Schmidt

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T17:01:55Z

**Summary**: Bloom filters are a fundamental data structure for approximate membership queries, with applications ranging from data analytics to databases and genomics. Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.   Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\times$ ($15.4\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU. We propose a modular CUDA/C++ implementation, which will be openly available soon.

### Radial electric field and density fluctuations measured by Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase in W7-X

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T16:34:07Z

**Summary**: Radial profiles of density fluctuations and radial electric field, $E_r$, have been measured using Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase achieved, under different heating power levels and magnetic configurations, along the 2018 W7-X experimental campaign. A pronounced $E_r$-well is measured with local values as high as -40 kV/m in the radial range $ρ\sim 0.7-0.8$ during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase. The maximum $E_r$ intensity scales with both plasma density and Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) power level following a similar trend as the plasma energy content. A good agreement is found when the experimental $E_r$ profiles are compared to simulations carried out using the neoclassical codes DKES and KNOSOS. The density fluctuation level decreases from the plasma edge toward the plasma core and the drop is more pronounced in the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase than in reference gas fuelled plasmas. Besides, in the post-pellet phase, the density fluctuation level is lower in the high iota magnetic configuration than in the standard one. In order to discriminate whether this difference is related to the differences in the plasma profiles or in the stability properties of the two configurations, gyrokinetic simulations have been carried out using the codes \texttt{stella} and EUTERPE. The simulation results point to the plasma profile evolution after the pellet injection and the stabilization effect of the radial electric field profile as the dominant players in the stabilization of the plasma turbulence.

### CTkvr: KV Cache Retrieval for Long-Context LLMs via Centroid then Token Indexing
**Authors**: Kuan Lu, Shuhang Lin, Sai Wu, Yichen Yao, Junhan Yang, Huan Li, Wei Chu, Xu Yinghui, Yuan Qi, Gang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T15:56:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

### Chorus: Harmonizing Context and Sensing Signals for Data-Free Model Customization in IoT
**Authors**: Liyu Zhang, Yejia Liu, Kwun Ho Liu, Runxi Huang, Xiaomin Ouyang

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T08:56:21Z

**Summary**: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

### Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling
**Authors**: Yunhao Fang, Weihao Yu, Shu Zhong, Qinghao Ye, Xuehan Xiong, Lai Wei

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T07:08:49Z

**Summary**: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized. For inference, our method sets a default large sliding window size of 32k for attention, and AHNs activate only when the sequence length exceeds the 32k window, addressing the quadratic-complexity issue of attention that emerges at that scale. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

### Context-Driven Performance Modeling for Causal Inference Operators on Neural Processing Units
**Authors**: Neelesh Gupta, Rakshith Jayanth, Dhruv Parikh, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T05:01:59Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of large language models has driven demand for long-context inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. However, deploying these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges due to architectural mismatch: the quadratic complexity of standard attention conflicts with NPU memory and compute patterns. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of causal inference operators on a modern NPU, benchmarking quadratic attention against sub-quadratic alternatives including structured state-space models and causal convolutions. Our analysis reveals a spectrum of critical bottlenecks: quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound with catastrophic cache inefficiency, while sub-quadratic variants span from compute-bound on programmable vector cores to memory-bound by data movement. These findings provide essential insights for co-designing hardware-aware models and optimization strategies to enable efficient long-context inference on edge platforms.

### Uncovering hidden protein conformations with high bandwidth nanopore measurements
**Authors**: Kyril Kavetsky, Sabine Hong, Chih-Yuan Lin, Roger Yang, Marija Drndic

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T02:14:04Z

**Summary**: Advanced nanopore measurements allow structural probing of molecules with high spatial and temporal resolution. We report high signal-to-noise, 1-10 MHz bandwidth, translocation measurements of the multi-state folding of heme protein cytochrome c in KCl solution through optimally designed silicon nitride pores of 2.3-3.3 nm diameter and 3.6-3.8 nm effective thickness, and an optimal concentration of a denaturant (Gdm-Cl). The pore diameter is slightly smaller than the protein size, forcing the protein to squeeze through the pore. The sufficiently large pore thickness allows enough time for protein probing at an applied field of approximately 250 kV/cm. Through Bayesian Information Criterion score analysis, current blockades reveal six distinct levels, attributed to specific protein states. We calculate the transition probabilities between the states and the conditional probabilities of the protein leaving the pore from each state. We validate the model by simulating events and comparing them to experimental data.

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T00:04:30Z

**Summary**: The cryogenic approach to the search for the neutron electric dipole moment--performing the experiment in superfluid liquid helium--holds promise for a substantial increase in sensitivity, potentially enabling a sensitivity level of $10^{-28}$ e-cm. A crucial component in realizing such an experiment is the high voltage and electrode system capable of providing an electric field of 75 kV/cm. This, in turn, requires an electric potential of 635 kV to be applied to the high voltage electrode, while simultaneously satisfying other experimental constraints, such as those on heat load and magnetic noise requirements. This paper describes the outcome of a comprehensive development program addressing these challenges. It outlines the system requirements, discusses new insights into relevant physical phenomena, and details selected technical solutions with their corresponding experimental demonstrations and expected performance. The results collectively demonstrate the successful development of the necessary technology for the high-voltage and electrode system for this approach.

### SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching
**Authors**: Xinye Zhao, Spyridon Mastorakis

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T22:36:44Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck. Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose \textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to 6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

### EVICPRESS: Joint KV-Cache Compression and Eviction for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Shaoting Feng, Yuhan Liu, Hanchen Li, Xiaokun Chen, Samuel Shen, Kuntai Du, Zhuohan Gu, Rui Zhang, Yuyang Huang, Yihua Cheng, Jiayi Yao, Qizheng Zhang, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T22:21:55Z

**Summary**: Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.   We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.

**Summary**: Current experiments seeking first-ever observation of Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos (UHEN) typically utilize radio frequency (RF) receiver antennas deployed in cold, radio-transparent polar ice, to measure the coherent RF signals resulting from neutrino interactions with ice molecules. Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres. Performance was validated by lowering the transmitter into a borehole at the South Pole to a depth of 1740 m, yielding high Signal-to-Noise ratio signals at a distance of 5 km from the source.

### MemFlow: Flowing Adaptive Memory for Consistent and Efficient Long Video Narratives
**Authors**: Sihui Ji, Xi Chen, Shuai Yang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Hengshuang Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:59Z

**Summary**: The core challenge for streaming video generation is maintaining the content consistency in long context, which poses high requirement for the memory design. Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.

### Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing
**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Siqi Kou, Yichao Fu, Samyam Rajbhandari, Tajana Rosing, Yuxiong He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:45:18Z

**Summary**: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:24:22Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

### Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework
**Authors**: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:18:50Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:04:14Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Kimina Lean Server, an open-source project designed as a high-performance verifier for reinforcement learning pipelines. Built on top of the Lean REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) maintained by the Lean FRO, our server combines server-side parallelism by managing multiple Lean processes in parallel with a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism that reuses Lean imports across requests. On the client side, a lightweight Python package enables submitting proof batches and receiving Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states.   Together, these features enable a scalable workflow for large-scale verification and data extraction. In our experiments, the Kimina Lean Server outperforms previous Lean interaction tools, achieving a 1.5 to 2 times speedup in verification time. Moreover, its improved efficiency has enabled its use in the large-scale training of state-of-the-art models such as Kimina-Prover.   We hope that our open-source project will support the neural theorem proving community and accelerate future progress by enabling efficient large-scale verification and proof data extraction.

### Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS): Learning to Route Between MHA, GQA, and MQA
**Authors**: Esmail Gumaan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:57:18Z

**Summary**: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Mixture-of-Attention-Schemes-MoAS.

### Adaptive Cache Pollution Control for Large Language Model Inference Workloads Using Temporal CNN-Based Prediction and Priority-Aware Replacement
**Authors**: Songze Liu, Hongkun Du, Shaowen Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:16:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMA, introduce unique memory access characteristics during inference due to frequent token sequence lookups and embedding vector retrievals. These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems.

### Astraea: A State-Aware Scheduling Engine for LLM-Powered Agents
**Authors**: Hongqiu Ni, Jiabao Zhang, Guopeng Li, Zilong Wang, Ruiqi Wu, Chi Zhang, Haisheng Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T06:55:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

### PAT: Accelerating LLM Decoding via Prefix-Aware Attention with Resource Efficient Multi-Tile Kernel
**Authors**: Jinjun Yi, Zhixin Zhao, Yitao Hu, Ke Yan, Weiwei Sun, Hao Wang, Laiping Zhao, Yuhao Zhang, Wenxin Li, Keqiu Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T05:44:34Z

**Summary**: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: one-query-per-CTA execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while one-size-fits-all tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.   This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 53.5% on average and TPOT by 17.0-93.1% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels. PAT's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/flashserve/PAT.

### OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration
**Authors**: Ruitong Sun, Tianze Yang, Wei Niu, Jin Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T05:11:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

### FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Zhenyu Ning, Jing Lin, Yiwu Yao, Danning Ke, Minyi Guo, Jieru Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:58:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

### SonicMoE: Accelerating MoE with IO and Tile-aware Optimizations
**Authors**: Wentao Guo, Mayank Mishra, Xinle Cheng, Ion Stoica, Tri Dao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:39:10Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel "token rounding" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.

### Efficient-DLM: From Autoregressive to Diffusion Language Models, and Beyond in Speed
**Authors**: Yonggan Fu, Lexington Whalen, Zhifan Ye, Xin Dong, Shizhe Diao, Jingyu Liu, Chengyue Wu, Hao Zhang, Enze Xie, Song Han, Maksim Khadkevich, Jan Kautz, Yingyan Celine Lin, Pavlo Molchanov

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:12:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

### Cooperative Caching Towards Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive-IoT Networks
**Authors**: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T02:49:43Z

**Summary**: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.

### Hyper-Minrank: A Unified Hypergraph Characterization of Multi-Sender Index Coding
**Authors**: Ali Khalesi, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T18:08:09Z

**Summary**: This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.

### ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding
**Authors**: Jia-Nan Li, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Chongxuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T17:41:19Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

### Uncovering the Role of Initial Saliency in U-Shaped Attention Bias: Scaling Initial Token Weight for Enhanced Long-Text Processing
**Authors**: Zewen Qiang, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T09:04:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

### CHIMERA: Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting for Zero-shot Image Morphing with Morphing-oriented Metrics
**Authors**: Dahyeon Kye, Jeahun Sung, Mingyu Jeon, Jihyong Oh

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T08:33:55Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.

### SneakPeek: Future-Guided Instructional Streaming Video Generation
**Authors**: Cheeun Hong, German Barquero, Fadime Sener, Markos Georgopoulos, Edgar Schönfeld, Stefan Popov, Yuming Du, Oscar Mañas, Albert Pumarola

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T06:32:57Z

**Summary**: Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

### SliceMoE: Bit-Sliced Expert Caching under Miss-Rate Constraints for Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Yuseon Choi, Sangjin Kim, Jungjun Oh, Gwangtae Park, Byeongcheol Kim, Hoi-Jun Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T05:33:07Z

**Summary**: MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.

### AutoRefiner: Improving Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models via Reflective Refinement Over the Stochastic Sampling Path
**Authors**: Zhengyang Yu, Akio Hayakawa, Masato Ishii, Qingtao Yu, Takashi Shibuya, Jing Zhang, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T05:13:40Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

### SCAdapter: Content-Style Disentanglement for Diffusion Style Transfer
**Authors**: Luan Thanh Trinh, Kenji Doi, Atsuki Osanai

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T04:02:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

### RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training
**Authors**: Tianyuan Wu, Lunxi Cao, Yining Wei, Wei Gao, Yuheng Zhao, Dakai An, Shaopan Xiong, Zhiqiang Lv, Ju Huang, Siran Yang, Yinghao Yu, Jiamang Wang, Lin Qu, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T02:21:28Z

**Summary**: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T17:45:53Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SUPERGEN, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SUPERGEN features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SUPERGEN incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SUPERGEN also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations show that SUPERGEN maximizes performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

### Think, Speak, Decide: Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Economic Decision-Making
**Authors**: Heyang Ma, Qirui Mi, Qipeng Yang, Zijun Fan, Bo Li, Haifeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T15:38:21Z

**Summary**: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

### Lethe: Layer- and Time-Adaptive KV Cache Pruning for Reasoning-Intensive LLM Serving
**Authors**: Hui Zeng, Daming Zhao, Pengfei Yang, WenXuan Hou, Tianyang Zheng, Hui Li, Weiye Ji, Jidong Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T14:18:27Z

**Summary**: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

### Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
**Authors**: Luke Shaw, Peter A. Whalley

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T11:12:56Z

**Summary**: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.

### No Cache Left Idle: Accelerating diffusion model via Extreme-slimming Caching
**Authors**: Tingyan Wen, Haoyu Li, Yihuang Chen, Xing Zhou, Lifei Zhu, Xueqian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T09:02:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

### Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Multimodal Data Interpretation
**Authors**: Karthikeya KV

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T08:28:50Z

**Summary**: This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence.

### NSNQuant: A Double Normalization Approach for Calibration-Free Low-Bit Vector Quantization of KV Cache
**Authors**: Donghyun Son, Euntae Choi, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T08:17:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive, especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache. By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization (Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### See Less, See Right: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping For Multimodal Reasoning
**Authors**: Shuoshuo Zhang, Yizhen Zhang, Jingjing Fu, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Yujiu Yang, Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:59:47Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

### Agentic Structured Graph Traversal for Root Cause Analysis of Code-related Incidents in Cloud Applications
**Authors**: Shengkun Cui, Rahul Krishna, Saurabh Jha, Ravishankar K. Iyer

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:56:18Z

**Summary**: Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.

### Explainable Multimodal Regression via Information Decomposition
**Authors**: Zhaozhao Ma, Shujian Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:07:18Z

**Summary**: Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference. Implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg.

### Introducing TrGLUE and SentiTurca: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Turkish General Language Understanding and Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Duygu Altinok

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:02:09Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

### Exact inference via quasi-conjugacy in two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet hidden Markov models
**Authors**: Marco Dalla Pria, Matteo Ruggiero, Dario Spanò

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:54:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.

### Yume-1.5: A Text-Controlled Interactive World Generation Model
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Mao, Zhen Li, Chuanhao Li, Xiaojie Xu, Kaining Ying, Tong He, Jiangmiao Pang, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:52:49Z

**Summary**: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

### Accelerating Diffusion Planners in Offline RL via Reward-Aware Consistency Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Xintong Duan, Yutong He, Fahim Tajwar, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, J. Zico Kolter, Jeff Schneider

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:50:58Z

**Summary**: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.

### Modeling Microenvironment Trajectories on Spatial Transcriptomics with NicheFlow
**Authors**: Kristiyan Sakalyan, Alessandro Palma, Filippo Guerranti, Fabian J. Theis, Stephan Günnemann

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:29:14Z

**Summary**: Understanding the evolution of cellular microenvironments in spatiotemporal data is essential for deciphering tissue development and disease progression. While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.

### Differentially Private Feature Release for Wireless Sensing: Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation on CSI Spectrograms
**Authors**: Ipek Sena Yilmaz, Onur G. Tuncer, Zeynep E. Aksoy, Zeynep Yağmur Baydemir

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:21:55Z

**Summary**: Wi-Fi/RF-based human sensing has achieved remarkable progress with deep learning, yet practical deployments increasingly require feature sharing for cloud analytics, collaborative training, or benchmark evaluation. Releasing intermediate representations such as CSI spectrograms can inadvertently expose sensitive information, including user identity, location, and membership, motivating formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we study differentially private (DP) feature release for wireless sensing and propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation mechanism tailored to the highly non-uniform structure of CSI time-frequency representations. Our pipeline converts CSI to bounded spectrogram features, applies sensitivity control via clipping, estimates task-relevant importance over the time-frequency plane, and allocates a global privacy budget across spectrogram blocks before injecting calibrated Gaussian noise. Experiments on multi-user activity sensing (WiMANS), multi-person 3D pose estimation (Person-in-WiFi 3D), and respiration monitoring (Resp-CSI) show that adaptive allocation consistently improves the privacy-utility frontier over uniform perturbation under the same privacy budget. Our method yields higher accuracy and lower error while substantially reducing empirical leakage in identity and membership inference attacks.

### Unifying Learning Dynamics and Generalization in Transformers Scaling Law
**Authors**: Chiwun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:20:09Z

**Summary**: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.   We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

### Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?
**Authors**: Grgur Kovač, Jérémy Perez, Rémy Portelas, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:12:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

### Laser: Governing Long-Horizon Agentic Search via Structured Protocol and Context Register
**Authors**: Shuting Wang, Qiaolin Xia, Vich Wang, Herberttli, Bobsimons, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:05:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have enabled agentic search systems that interleave multi-step reasoning with external tool use. However, existing frameworks largely rely on unstructured natural-language reasoning and accumulate raw intermediate traces in the context, which often leads to unstable reasoning trajectories, context overflow, and degraded performance on complex multi-hop queries. In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion. Experiments on Qwen2.5/3-series models across challenging multi-hop QA datasets show that Laser consistently outperforms existing agentic search baselines under both prompting-only and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating that Laser provides a principled and effective foundation for robust, scalable agentic search.

### Agent-based simulation of online social networks and disinformation
**Authors**: Alejandro Buitrago López, Alberto Ortega Pastor, David Montoro Aguilera, Mario Fernández Tárraga, Jesús Verdú Chacón, Javier Pastor-Galindo, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T16:56:45Z

**Summary**: Research on online social networks (OSNs) is often hindered by platform opacity, limited access to data, and ethical constraints. Simulation offer a valuable alternative, but existing frameworks frequently lack realism and explainability. This paper presents a simulation framework that models synthetic social networks with agents endowed with demographic-based personality traits and finite-state behavioral automata, enabling realistic and interpretable actions. A generative module powered by a large language model (LLM) produces context-aware social media posts consistent with each agent's profile and memory. In parallel, a red module implements DISARM-inspired workflows to orchestrate disinformation campaigns executed by malicious agents targeting simulated audiences. A Mastodon-based visualization layer supports real-time inspection and post-hoc validation of agent activity within a familiar interface. We evaluate the resulting synthetic social networks using topological metrics and LLM-based content assessments, demonstrating structural, behavioral, and linguistic realism. Overall, the framework enables the creation of customizable and controllable social network environments for studying information dynamics and the effects of disinformation.

### Improving Multi-turn Task Completion in Task-Oriented Dialog Systems via Prompt Chaining and Fine-Grained Feedback
**Authors**: Moghis Fereidouni, Md Sajid Ahmed, Adib Mosharrof, A. B. Siddique

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T16:51:41Z

**Summary**: Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems facilitate users in accomplishing complex, multi-turn tasks through natural language. While instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a range of single-turn NLP tasks, they often struggle with reliable multi-turn task completion in TOD settings, particularly when generating API calls required to interact with external systems. To address this, we introduce RealTOD, a novel framework that improves LLM-based TOD systems through (1) prompt chaining and (2) fine-grained feedback. Prompt chaining enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by automatically synthesizing a schema-aligned in-context example for the target task. Fine-grained feedback verifies each generated API call against the domain schema, identifies specific errors, and provides targeted correction prompts. To evaluate task completion reliability, we introduce full API Call Accuracy as a robust metric, along with detailed sub-metrics to capture common failure modes. We conduct extensive experiments on the SGD and BiTOD benchmarks using four LLMs. RealTOD improves Full API accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art AutoTOD by 37.10% on SGD and supervised learning-based baseline SimpleTOD by 10.32% on BiTOD. Human evaluations further confirm that LLMs integrated with RealTOD achieve superior task completion, fluency, and informativeness compared to existing methods.

### Primordial black holes and smooth coarse-graining in excursion set theory
**Authors**: Daiki Saito, Koki Tokeshi

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T16:29:28Z

**Summary**: The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes. Within the framework, this article investigates how a smooth coarse-graining procedure affects the resulting PBH mass function. As a demonstrative example, we employ a Gaussian window function, for which the stochastic noise becomes fully correlated across scales. It is found that these correlated noises result in a mass function of PBHs, whose maximum and its neighbourhood are predominantly determined by the probability that the density contrast exceeds a given threshold at each mass scale. Our results clarify the role of noise correlations induced by smooth coarse-graining and highlight their importance in predicting the abundance of PBHs.

### Communication-Efficient and Differentially Private Vertical Federated Learning with Zeroth-Order Optimization
**Authors**: Jianing Zhang, Evan Chen, Dong-Jun Han, Chaoyue Liu, Christopher G. Brinton

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T16:03:55Z

**Summary**: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training across feature-partitioned devices, yet its reliance on device-server information exchange introduces significant communication overhead and privacy risks. Downlink communication from the server to devices in VFL exposes gradient-related signals of the global loss that can be leveraged in inference attacks. Existing privacy-preserving VFL approaches that inject differential privacy (DP) noise on the downlink have the natural repercussion of degraded gradient quality, slowed convergence, and excessive communication rounds. In this work, we propose DPZV, a communication-efficient and differentially private ZO-VFL framework with tunable privacy guarantees. Based on zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, DPZV injects calibrated scalar-valued DP noise on the downlink, significantly reducing variance amplification while providing equivalent protection against targeted inference attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish convergence guarantees comparable to first-order DP-SGD, despite relying solely on ZO estimators, and prove that DPZV satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPZV consistently achieves a superior privacy-utility tradeoff and requires fewer communication rounds than existing DP-VFL baselines under strict privacy constraints ($ε\leq 10$).

### fMRI-LM: Towards a Universal Foundation Model for Language-Aligned fMRI Understanding
**Authors**: Yuxiang Wei, Yanteng Zhang, Xi Xiao, Chengxuan Qian, Tianyang Wang, Vince D. Calhoun

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:54:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.

### Periodic Asynchrony: An Effective Method for Accelerating Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jian Lu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:48:38Z

**Summary**: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.

### Prefill vs. Decode Bottlenecks: SRAM-Frequency Tradeoffs and the Memory-Bandwidth Ceiling
**Authors**: Hannah Atmer, Yuan Yao, Thiemo Voigt, Stefanos Kaxiras

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:42:29Z

**Summary**: Energy consumption dictates the cost and environmental impact of deploying Large Language Models. This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.

### Real-Time Streamable Generative Speech Restoration with Flow Matching
**Authors**: Simon Welker, Bunlong Lay, Maris Hillemann, Tal Peer, Timo Gerkmann

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:39:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have greatly impacted the speech processing field in recent years, exhibiting high speech naturalness and spawning a new research direction. Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs.   Here, we present Stream$.$FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task.   Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream$.$FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream$.$FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.

### AI Urban Scientist: Multi-Agent Collaborative Automation for Urban Research
**Authors**: Tong Xia, Jiankun Zhang, Ruiwen You, Ao Xu, Linghao Zhang, Tengyao Tu, Jingzhi Wang, Jinghua Piao, Yunke Zhang, Fengli Xu, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:38:22Z

**Summary**: Urban research aims to understand how cities operate and evolve as complex adaptive systems. With the rapid growth of urban data and analytical methodologies, the central challenge of the field has shifted from data availability to the integration of heterogeneous data into coherent, verifiable urban knowledge through multidisciplinary approaches. Recent advances in AI, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have enabled the development of AI scientists capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis generation, and data-driven experimentation, demonstrating substantial potential for autonomous urban research. However, most general-purpose AI systems remain misaligned with the domain-specific knowledge, methodological conventions, and inferential standards required in urban studies. Here, we introduce the AI Urban Scientist, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework designed to support autonomous urban research. Grounded in hypotheses, peer-review feedback, datasets, and research methodologies distilled from large-scale prior studies, the system constructs structured domain knowledge that guides LLM-based agents to automatically generate hypotheses, identify and integrate multi-source urban datasets, conduct empirical analyses and simulations, and iteratively refine analytical methods. Through this process, the framework synthesizes new insights in urban science and accelerates the urban research lifecycle.

### Inferring Eccentricity of Binary Black Holes from Spin-Orbit Misalignment
**Authors**: Vishal Baibhav

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:38:02Z

**Summary**: Orbital eccentricity remains one of the least accessible parameters in observations of binary black hole (BBH) systems, largely erased by gravitational radiation long before detection. We introduce a new method to recover this lost parameter by using a more accessible and routinely measurable quantity: spin-orbit misalignment. In isolated binary evolution, a natal kick from the second supernova both tilts the orbital plane and injects orbital eccentricity, forging a direct and quantifiable connection between spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By measuring this spin-tilt using gravitational waves, we can not only constrain the natal kick, but we can also reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. We apply this method to GW190412 and GW241011, assuming an isolated formation channel, and show how their eccentricity at formation can be constrained even in the absence of direct eccentricity measurements. As more advanced detectors come online, improved signal-to-noise ratios will tighten spin-tilt constraints, allowing more precise and reliable estimates of BBH formation eccentricity. Combining this method with multiband observations from LISA and next-generation (XG) detectors will allow us to recover not only eccentricity but also the binary's orbital separation and redshift at formation, offering a clearer picture of the birth environments of BBH systems and processes that drive their merger.

### Unveiling the Learning Mind of Language Models: A Cognitive Framework and Empirical Study
**Authors**: Zhengyu Hu, Jianxun Lian, Zheyuan Xiao, Seraphina Zhang, Tianfu Wang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Xing Xie, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:33:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

### Degradation-Aware All-in-One Image Restoration via Latent Prior Encoding
**Authors**: S M A Sharif, Abdur Rehman, Fayaz Ali Dharejo, Radu Timofte, Rizwan Ali Naqvi

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:28:16Z

**Summary**: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.

### FUSCO: High-Performance Distributed Data Shuffling via Transformation-Communication Fusion
**Authors**: Zhuoran Zhu, Chunyang Zhu, Hao Lin, Xu Fu, Yiming Zhou, Quanlu Zhang, Zhenhua Li, Feng Qian, Chao Yu, Boxun Li, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:16:11Z

**Summary**: Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models rely on \emph{expert parallelism} for efficient training and inference, which splits experts across devices and necessitates distributed data shuffling to route each token to its assigned experts. However, existing communication libraries handle this shuffling poorly; its overhead can account for over half of end-to-end runtime. We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path. Lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms complement the engine by eliminating redundant communication and dispersing traffic. Evaluations on representative benchmarks illustrate that FUSCO achieves up to 3.84$\times$ and 2.01$\times$ speedups over NCCL and DeepEP (the state-of-the-art MoE communication library), respectively. In end-to-end MoE tasks, compared to NCCL and DeepEP, FUSCO reduces the training latency by 1.17-1.39$\times$ and 1.10-1.19$\times$, and lowers the first-token generation latency in inference by 1.09-1.25$\times$ and 1.06-1.16$\times$.

### Context-Aware Intelligent Chatbot Framework Leveraging Mobile Sensing
**Authors**: Ziyan Zhang, Nan Gao, Zhiqiang Nie, Shantanu Pal, Haining Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:04:26Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), intelligent conversational assistants have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, they still mainly rely on explicit textual input and do not know the real world behaviors of users. This paper proposes a context-sensitive conversational assistant framework grounded in mobile sensing data. By collecting user behavior and environmental data through smartphones, we abstract these signals into 16 contextual scenarios and translate them into natural language prompts, thus improving the model's understanding of the user's state. We design a structured prompting system to guide the LLM in generating a more personalized and contextually relevant dialogue. This approach integrates mobile sensing with large language models, demonstrating the potential of passive behavioral data in intelligent conversation and offering a viable path toward digital health and personalized interaction.

### Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models with Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion
**Authors**: Kaleem Ullah Qasim, Jiashu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T13:40:53Z

**Summary**: Background: Recursive reasoning models achieve strong performance through iterative refinement, allowing small networks to match large language models. However, training is computationally expensive, often requiring 36 GPU-hours for Sudoku extreme. Existing models use fixed recursion depth and uniform supervision weighting, leading to inefficient training. Objectives: We propose CGAR (Curriculum-Guided Adaptive Recursion), applying curriculum learning to architectural depth. CGAR introduces Progressive Depth Curriculum (PDC) to dynamically adjust recursion depth and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting (HSW) to apply exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps. Methods: PDC implements a three-stage schedule transitioning from shallow (2, 1) to full depth (6, 3) configurations, providing 41.4% FLOPs reduction. HSW applies exponential decay to supervision steps, achieving 40% gradient variance reduction and accelerated convergence. Results: On Sudoku-Extreme, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours) with only a 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). PDC alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, showing a Pareto improvement in efficiency and quality. HSW provides 1.61x speedup. CGAR-trained models show superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Conclusions: CGAR enables efficient training of recursive models on modest hardware. By treating depth as a scheduled parameter, it achieves substantial savings and prevents overfitting, making these models practical for neurosymbolic AI and program synthesis. https://github.com/Kaleemullahqasim/CGAR and huggingface.co/Kaleemullah/trm-cgar-sudoku.

### BeDKD: Backdoor Defense based on Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Directional Mapping Modulator
**Authors**: Zhengxian Wu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Yinghan Zhou, Changtong dou, Yiming Xue

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T12:28:29Z

**Summary**: Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Backdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial Knowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without significantly reducing the CACC. Our code are available in https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/BeDKD.

### ToTRL: Unlock LLM Tree-of-Thoughts Reasoning Potential through Puzzles Solving
**Authors**: Haoyuan Wu, Xueyi Chen, Rui Ming, Jilong Gao, Shoubo Hu, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T12:24:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection. The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

### iSHIFT: Lightweight Slow-Fast GUI Agent with Adaptive Perception
**Authors**: Sarthak Mehrotra, Sairam V C Rebbapragada, Mani Hemanth Reddy Bonthu, Vineeth N Balasubramanian

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T12:09:15Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

### Look Closer! An Adversarial Parametric Editing Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in VLMs
**Authors**: Jiayu Hu, Beibei Li, Jiangwei Xia, Yanjun Qin, Bing Ji, Zhongshi He

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:56:45Z

**Summary**: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/hujiayu1223/ALEAHallu.

### HARMON-E: Hierarchical Agentic Reasoning for Multimodal Oncology Notes to Extract Structured Data
**Authors**: Shashi Kant Gupta, Arijeet Pramanik, Jerrin John Thomas, Regina Schwind, Lauren Wiener, Avi Raju, Jeremy Kornbluth, Yanshan Wang, Zhaohui Su, Hrituraj Singh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:32:02Z

**Summary**: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

### Efficient estimation of average treatment effects with unmeasured confounding and proxies
**Authors**: Chunrong Ai, Jiawei Shan

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:30:36Z

**Summary**: Proximal causal inference provides a framework for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in the presence of unmeasured confounding by leveraging outcome and treatment proxies. Identification in this framework relies on the existence of a so-called bridge function. Standard approaches typically postulate a parametric specification for the bridge function, which is estimated in a first step and then plugged into an ATE estimator. However, this sequential procedure suffers from two potential sources of efficiency loss: (i) the difficulty of efficiently estimating a bridge function defined by an integral equation, and (ii) the failure to account for the correlation between the estimation steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that approximates the integral equation with increasing moment restrictions and jointly estimates the bridge function and the ATE. We show that, under suitable conditions, our estimator is efficient. Additionally, we provide a data-driven procedure for selecting the tuning parameter (i.e., the number of moment restrictions). Simulation studies reveal that the proposed method performs well in finite samples, and an application to the right heart catheterization dataset from the SUPPORT study demonstrates its practical value.

### A Lightweight Multi-Scale Attention Framework for Real-Time Spinal Endoscopic Instance Segmentation
**Authors**: Qi Lai, JunYan Li, Qiang Cai, Lei Wang, Tao Yan, XiaoKun Liang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:07:06Z

**Summary**: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:02:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.

### Impact of neglecting center-of-mass acceleration in parameter estimation of stellar-mass black holes
**Authors**: Suvikranth Gera, Poulami Dutta Roy

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:54:54Z

**Summary**: A tertiary body near a coalescing binary can imprint its influence on the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by that binary in the form of center-of-mass (CoM) acceleration. An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\, \rm{M}_{\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $α$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $α= 10^{-7} \rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\, \rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET). Our study thus highlights the crucial implications of considering the presence of a tertiary body in the GW emitted by a stellar-mass BBH when observed in 3G detectors.

### GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction
**Authors**: Daeyoung Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:46:54Z

**Summary**: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches, deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

**Authors**: Hanwen Zhang, Ruichen Zhang, Wei Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Yonggang Wen, Chunyan Miao

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:37:24Z

**Summary**: The energy optimization and demand side management (DSM) of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled microgrids are being transformed by generative artificial intelligence, such as large language models (LLMs). This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, and emphasizes their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) as a representative example of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). We investigate challenges and solutions associated with DSM and explore the new opportunities presented by leveraging LLMs. Then, we propose an innovative solution that enhances LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for automatic problem formulation, code generation, and customizing optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, and highlight our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability. This work shows LLMs' potential in energy optimization of the IoT-enabled microgrids and promotes intelligent DSM solutions.

### MISA: Memory-Efficient LLMs Optimization with Module-wise Importance Sampling
**Authors**: Yuxi Liu, Renjia Deng, Yutong He, Xue Wang, Tao Yao, Kun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T09:58:16Z

**Summary**: The substantial memory demands of pre-training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) require memory-efficient optimization algorithms. One promising approach is layer-wise optimization, which treats each transformer block as a single layer and optimizes it sequentially, while freezing the other layers to save optimizer states and activations. Although effective, these methods ignore the varying importance of the modules within each layer, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, layer-wise sampling provides only limited memory savings, as at least one full layer must remain active during optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA), a novel method that divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns importance scores to each module. MISA uses a weighted random sampling mechanism to activate modules, provably reducing gradient variance compared to layer-wise sampling. Additionally, we establish an \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\) convergence rate under non-convex and stochastic conditions, where $K$ is the total number of block updates, and provide a detailed memory analysis showcasing MISA's superiority over existing baseline methods. Experiments on diverse learning tasks validate the effectiveness of MISA. Source code is available at https://github.com/pkumelon/MISA.

### Broken Words, Broken Performance: Effect of Tokenization on Performance of LLMs
**Authors**: Sachin Pawar, Manoj Apte, Kshitij Jadhav, Girish Keshav Palshikar, Nitin Ramrakhiyani

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T09:16:33Z

**Summary**: Tokenization is the first step in training any Large Language Model (LLM), where the text is split into a sequence of tokens as per the model's fixed vocabulary. This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of "natural" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits "martial" into "mart" and "ial"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.

### GroupDebate: Enhancing the Efficiency of Multi-Agent Debate Using Group Discussion
**Authors**: Tongxuan Liu, Xingyu Wang, Weizhe Huang, Wenjiang Xu, Yuting Zeng, Lei Jiang, Hailong Yang, Jing Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T09:07:24Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse NLP tasks. Extensive research has explored how to enhance the logical reasoning abilities such as Chain-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency, Tree-Of-Thoughts, and multi-agent debates. In the context of multi-agent debates, significant performance improvements can be achieved with an increasing number of agents and debate rounds. However, the escalation in the number of agents and debate rounds can drastically raise the tokens cost of debates, thereby limiting the scalability of the multi-agent debate technique. To better harness the advantages of multi-agent debates in logical reasoning tasks, this paper proposes a method to significantly reduce token cost in multi-agent debates. This approach involves dividing all agents into multiple debate groups, with agents engaging in debates within their respective groups and sharing interim debate results between groups. Comparative experiments across multiple datasets have demonstrated that this method can reduce the total tokens by up to 51.7% during debates and while potentially enhancing accuracy by as much as 25%. Our method significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of interactions in the multi-agent debate.

### Advancing Expert Specialization for Better MoE
**Authors**: Hongcan Guo, Haolang Lu, Guoshun Nan, Bolun Chu, Jialin Zhuang, Yuan Yang, Wenhao Che, Sicong Leng, Qimei Cui, Xudong Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:46:16Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

### SWE-RM: Execution-free Feedback For Software Engineering Agents
**Authors**: KaShun Shum, Binyuan Hui, Jiawei Chen, Lei Zhang, X. W., Jiaxi Yang, Yuzhen Huang, Junyang Lin, Junxian He

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:26:18Z

**Summary**: Execution-based feedback like unit testing is widely used in the development of coding agents through test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

### Semiparametric Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Single-Index Model
**Authors**: Nathan Kallus

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:22:41Z

**Summary**: Aligning large language models to preference data is commonly implemented by assuming a known link function between the distribution of observed preferences and the unobserved rewards (e.g., a logistic link as in Bradley-Terry). If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards.

### Evaluating Large Language Models for Line-Level Vulnerability Localization
**Authors**: Jian Zhang, Chong Wang, Anran Li, Weisong Sun, Cen Zhang, Wei Ma, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:03:04Z

**Summary**: Recently, Automated Vulnerability Localization (AVL) has attracted growing attention, aiming to facilitate diagnosis by pinpointing the specific lines of code responsible for vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in various domains, yet their effectiveness in line-level vulnerability localization remains underexplored.   In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical evaluation of LLMs for AVL. Our study examines 19 leading LLMs suitable for code analysis, including ChatGPT and multiple open-source models, spanning encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, with model sizes from 60M to 70B parameters. We evaluate three paradigms including few-shot prompting, discriminative fine-tuning, and generative fine-tuning with and without Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), on both a BigVul-derived dataset for C/C++ and a smart contract vulnerability dataset.}   Our results show that discriminative fine-tuning achieves substantial performance gains over existing learning-based AVL methods when sufficient training data is available. In low-data settings, prompting advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT proves more effective. We also identify challenges related to input length and unidirectional context during fine-tuning, and propose two remedial strategies: a sliding window approach and right-forward embedding, both of which yield significant improvements. Moreover, we provide the first assessment of LLM generalizability in AVL, showing that certain models can transfer effectively across Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and projects. However, performance degrades notably for newly discovered vulnerabilities containing unfamiliar lexical or structural patterns, underscoring the need for continual adaptation.

### Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs
**Authors**: Yafeng Tang, Xiaoou Ding, Jianzhuo Du, Zishuo Yan, Zhuang Ma, Zheng Liang, Zekai Qian, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:02:51Z

**Summary**: Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data. Code is available at https://github.com/windblow32/DATE.

### Accelerate Speculative Decoding with Sparse Computation in Verification
**Authors**: Jikai Wang, Jianchao Tan, Yuxuan Hu, Jiayu Qin, Yerui Sun, Yuchen Xie, Xunliang Cai, Juntao Li, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:53:41Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive language model inference by verifying multiple draft tokens in parallel. However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.

### X-Boundary: Establishing Exact Safety Boundary to Shield LLMs from Multi-Turn Jailbreaks without Compromising Usability
**Authors**: Xiaoya Lu, Dongrui Liu, Yi Yu, Luxin Xu, Jing Shao

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:50:47Z

**Summary**: Despite the rapid development of safety alignment techniques for LLMs, defending against multi-turn jailbreaks is still a challenging task. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing defense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks but compromise usability, i.e., reducing general capabilities or causing the over-refusal problem. From the perspective of mechanism interpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a boundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations. Therefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are inevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability. To address this issue, we propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe representations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. In this way, harmful representations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones. Experimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate by about 20% and maintaining nearly complete general capability. Furthermore, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that X-Boundary can accelerate the convergence process during training. Please see our code at: https://github.com/AI45Lab/X-Boundary.

### The Cultural Gene of Large Language Models: A Study on the Impact of Cross-Corpus Training on Model Values and Biases
**Authors**: Emanuel Z. Fenech-Borg, Tilen P. Meznaric-Kos, Milica D. Lekovic-Bojovic, Arni J. Hentze-Djurhuus

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:30:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200 prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions: Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx -1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI) against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural hegemony.

### Explainable Statute Prediction via Attention-based Model and LLM Prompting
**Authors**: Sachin Pawar, Girish Keshav Palshikar, Anindita Sinha Banerjee, Nitin Ramrakhiyani, Basit Ali

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:29:51Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term "statute" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.

### The First X-ray Polarimetry of GRS 1739--278 Reveals Its Rapidly Spinning Black Hole
**Authors**: Qing-Chang Zhao, Michal Dovciak, Han-Cheng Li, Lian Tao, Hua Feng, Federico Vincentelli, Giorgio Matt, Philip Kaaret, Shuang-Nan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:16:48Z

**Summary**: We present a joint spectro-polarimetric analysis of the black hole X-ray binary GRS~1739--278 during its 2025 mini-outburst, using simultaneous observations from \ixpe\ and \nustar. The \ixpe\ data show a polarization degree of ${\rm PD} = (2.3 \pm 0.4)\%$ and a polarization angle of ${\rm PA} = 62^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--8~keV range. The model-independent analysis reveals that the PD increases from $\sim 2\%$ at 2~keV to $\sim 10\%$ in the 6--8~keV band, while the PA remains stable across the \ixpe\ band within statistical uncertainties. Broadband spectral modeling of the combined \ixpe\ and \nustar\ datasets shows that hard Comptonization contributes negligibly in this soft-state observation, while a substantial reflected component is required in addition to the thermal disk emission. We then model the \ixpe\ Stokes spectra using the \texttt{kynbbrr} model. The best-fitting results indicate that high-spin configurations enhance the contribution of reflected returning radiation, which dominates the observed polarization properties. From the \texttt{kynbbrr} modeling, we infer an extreme black hole spin of $a = 0.994^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ and a system inclination of $i = 54^\circ{}^{+8^\circ}_{-4^\circ}$. Owing to the large contribution from returning radiation, the observed polarization direction is nearly parallel to the projected system axis, the position angle of which is predicted to be $58^\circ \pm 4^\circ$. Our results demonstrate that X-ray polarimetry, combined with broadband spectroscopy, directly probes the geometry and relativistic effects in accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes.

### Computational Economics in Large Language Models: Exploring Model Behavior and Incentive Design under Resource Constraints
**Authors**: Sandeep Reddy, Kabir Khan, Rohit Patil, Ananya Chakraborty, Faizan A. Khan, Swati Kulkarni, Arjun Verma, Neha Singh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:02:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost. We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First, we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs under strict resource constraints.

### DySK-Attn: A Framework for Efficient, Real-Time Knowledge Updating in Large Language Models via Dynamic Sparse Knowledge Attention
**Authors**: Kabir Khan, Priya Sharma, Arjun Mehta, Neha Gupta, Ravi Narayanan

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:46:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search, efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the ever-changing world.

### Ensembling Multiple Hallucination Detectors Trained on VLLM Internal Representations
**Authors**: Yuto Nakamizo, Ryuhei Miyazato, Hikaru Tanabe, Ryuta Yamakura, Kiori Hatanaka

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:42:50Z

**Summary**: This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top entries on the final leaderboard.

**Summary**: Digital crown design remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in restorative dentistry. We present \textbf{CrownGen}, a generative framework that automates patient-customized crown design using a denoising diffusion model on a novel tooth-level point cloud representation. The system employs two core components: a boundary prediction module to establish spatial priors and a diffusion-based generative module to synthesize high-fidelity morphology for multiple teeth in a single inference pass. We validated CrownGen through a quantitative benchmark on 496 external scans and a clinical study of 26 restoration cases. Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows. By automating complex prosthetic modeling, CrownGen offers a scalable solution to lower costs, shorten turnaround times, and enhance patient access to high-quality dental care.

### "It's the only thing I can trust": Envisioning Large Language Model Use by Autistic Workers for Communication Assistance
**Authors**: JiWoong Jang, Sanika Moharana, Patrick Carrington, Andrew Begel

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:28:24Z

**Summary**: Autistic adults often experience stigma and discrimination at work, leading them to seek social communication support from coworkers, friends, and family despite emotional risks. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered an alternative. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of LLM use by autistic adults at work and explore opportunities and risks of LLMs as a source of social communication advice. We asked 11 autistic participants to present questions about their own workplace-related social difficulties to (1) a GPT-4-based chatbot and (2) a disguised human confederate. Our evaluation shows that participants strongly preferred LLM over confederate interactions. However, a coach specializing in supporting autistic job-seekers raised concerns that the LLM was dispensing questionable advice. We highlight how this divergence in participant and practitioner attitudes reflects existing schisms in HCI on the relative privileging of end-user wants versus normative good and propose design considerations for LLMs to center autistic experiences.

### HopCast: Calibration of Autoregressive Dynamics Models
**Authors**: Muhammad Bilal Shahid, Cody Fleming

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:28:22Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models are often trained to approximate dynamical systems that can be modeled using differential equations. Many of these models are optimized to predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step predictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep Ensembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via autoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce calibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative Predictor-Corrector approach named \hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the dynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's output based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set of errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher predictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The calibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical systems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty propagation methods based on calibration errors.

### Optimizing Resource Allocation for Geographically-Distributed Inference by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tingyang Sun, Ting He, Bo Ji, Parimal Parag

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:13:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.

### A Communication-Efficient Distributed Algorithm for Learning with Heterogeneous and Structurally Incomplete Multi-Site Data
**Authors**: Xiaokang Liu, Yuchen Yang, Yifei Sun, Jiang Bian, Yanyuan Ma, Raymond J. Carroll, Yong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:07:39Z

**Summary**: In multicenter biomedical research, integrating data from multiple decentralized sites provides more robust and generalizable findings due to its larger sample size and the ability to account for the between-site heterogeneity. However, sharing individual-level data across sites is often difficult due to patient privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions. To overcome this challenge, many distributed algorithms, that fit a global model by only communicating aggregated information across sites, have been proposed. A major challenge in applying existing distributed algorithms to real-world data is that their validity often relies on the assumption that data across sites are independently and identically distributed, which is frequently violated in practice. In biomedical applications, data distributions across clinical sites can be heterogeneous. Additionally, the set of covariates available at each site may vary due to different data collection protocols. We propose a distributed inference framework for data integration in the presence of both distribution heterogeneity and data structural heterogeneity. By modeling heterogeneous and structurally missing data using density-tilted generalized method of moments, we developed a general aggregated data-based distributed algorithm that is communication-efficient and heterogeneity-aware. We establish the asymptotic properties of our estimator and demonstrate the validity of our method via simulation studies.

### MASFIN: A Multi-Agent System for Decomposed Financial Reasoning and Forecasting
**Authors**: Marc S. Montalvo, Hamed Yaghoobian

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:01:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are transforming data-intensive domains, with finance representing a high-stakes environment where transparent and reproducible analysis of heterogeneous signals is essential. Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.

### CricBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Cricket Analytics
**Authors**: Vaibhav Devraj, Dhruv Kumar, Jagat Sesh Challa

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T05:59:19Z

**Summary**: Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a "Gold Standard" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.

### DPAR: Dynamic Patchification for Efficient Autoregressive Visual Generation
**Authors**: Divyansh Srivastava, Akshay Mehra, Pranav Maneriker, Debopam Sanyal, Vishnu Raj, Vijay Kamarshi, Fan Du, Joshua Kimball

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T05:03:47Z

**Summary**: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

### Secure and Explainable Fraud Detection in Finance via Hierarchical Multi-source Dataset Distillation
**Authors**: Yiming Qian, Thorsten Neumann, Xueyining Huang, David Hardoon, Fei Gao, Yong Liu, Siow Mong Rick Goh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T05:00:35Z

**Summary**: We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.   On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).   Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.

### EasyOmnimatte: Taming Pretrained Inpainting Diffusion Models for End-to-End Video Layered Decomposition
**Authors**: Yihan Hu, Xuelin Chen, Xiaodong Cun

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:57:59Z

**Summary**: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

### Nonparametric methods for comparing distribution functionals for dependent samples with application to inequality measures
**Authors**: Jean-Marie Dufour, Tianyu He

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:55:48Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes asymptotically distribution-free inference methods for comparing a broad range of welfare indices across dependent samples, including those employed in inequality, poverty, and risk analysis. Two distinct situations are considered. \emph{First}, we propose asymptotic and bootstrap intersection methods which are completely robust to arbitrary dependence between two samples. \emph{Second}, we focus on the common case of overlapping samples -- a special form of dependent samples where sample dependence arises solely from matched pairs -- and provide asymptotic and bootstrap methods for comparing indices. We derive consistent estimates for asymptotic variances using the influence function approach. The performance of the proposed methods is studied in a simulation experiment: we find that confidence intervals with overlapping samples exhibit satisfactory coverage rates with reasonable precision, whereas conventional methods based on an assumption of independent samples have an inferior performance in terms of coverage rates and interval widths. Asymptotic inference can be less reliable when dealing with heavy-tailed distributions, while the bootstrap method provides a viable remedy, unless the variance is substantial or nonexistent. The intersection method yields reliable results with arbitrary dependent samples, including instances where overlapping samples are not feasible. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our proposed methods in analyzing dynamic changes in household financial inequality in Italy over time.

### Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency: CNN Fusion Models for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening
**Authors**: Md Rafid Islam, Rafsan Jany, Akib Ahmed, Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:54:43Z

**Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

### Inducing Causal World Models in LLMs for Zero-Shot Physical Reasoning
**Authors**: Aditya Sharma, Ananya Gupta, Chengyu Wang, Chiamaka Adebayo, Jakub Kowalski

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:52:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

### TimeBill: Time-Budgeted Inference for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qi Fan, An Zou, Yehan Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:49:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

### Fast Inference of Visual Autoregressive Model with Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees
**Authors**: Haodong Lei, Hongsong Wang, Xin Geng, Liang Wang, Pan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:45:49Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/Haodong-Lei-Ray/ADT-Tree.

### Think, Act, Learn: A Framework for Autonomous Robotic Agents using Closed-Loop Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anjali R. Menon, Rohit K. Sharma, Priya Singh, Chengyu Wang, Aurora M. Ferreira, Mateja Novak

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:45:12Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.

### Video Event Reasoning and Prediction by Fusing World Knowledge from LLMs with Vision Foundation Models
**Authors**: L'ea Dubois, Klaus Schmidt, Chengyu Wang, Ji-Hoon Park, Lin Wang, Santiago Munoz

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:37:45Z

**Summary**: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.

### SlowFast-SCI: Slow-Fast Deep Unfolding Learning for Spectral Compressive Imaging
**Authors**: Haijin Zeng, Xuan Lu, Yurong Zhang, Qiangqiang Shen, Guoqing Chao, Li Jiang, Yongyong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:24:43Z

**Summary**: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/XuanLu11/SlowFast-SCI.

### A Comedy of Estimators: On KL Regularization in RL Training of LLMs

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:20:58Z

**Summary**: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

### HeartBench: Probing Core Dimensions of Anthropomorphic Intelligence in LLMs
**Authors**: Jiaxin Liu, Peiyi Tu, Wenyu Chen, Yihong Zhuang, Xinxia Ling, Anji Zhou, Chenxi Wang, Zhuo Han, Zhengkai Yang, Junbo Zhao, Zenan Huang, Yuanyuan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:54:56Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

### RoboSafe: Safeguarding Embodied Agents via Executable Safety Logic
**Authors**: Le Wang, Zonghao Ying, Xiao Yang, Quanchen Zou, Zhenfei Yin, Tianlin Li, Jian Yang, Yaodong Yang, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:30:51Z

**Summary**: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

### StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion
**Authors**: Yutong Wu, Di Huang, Ruosi Wan, Yue Peng, Shijie Shang, Chenrui Cao, Lei Qi, Rui Zhang, Zidong Du, Jie Yan, Xing Hu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:12:16Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

### AlignAR: Generative Sentence Alignment for Arabic-English Parallel Corpora of Legal and Literary Texts
**Authors**: Baorong Huang, Ali Asiri

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:10:43Z

**Summary**: High-quality parallel corpora are essential for Machine Translation (MT) research and translation teaching. However, Arabic-English resources remain scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings. In this paper, we present AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and a new Arabic-English dataset comprising complex legal and literary texts. Our evaluation demonstrates that "Easy" datasets lack the discriminatory power to fully assess alignment methods. By reducing one-to-one mappings in our "Hard" subset, we exposed the limitations of traditional alignment methods. In contrast, LLM-based approaches demonstrated superior robustness, achieving an overall F1-score of 85.5%, a 9% improvement over previous methods. Our datasets and codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/XXX.

### Lightweight Diffusion-based Framework for Online Imagined Speech Decoding in Aphasia
**Authors**: Eunyeong Ko, Soowon Kim, Ha-Na Jo

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:49:50Z

**Summary**: Individuals with aphasia experience severe difficulty in real-time verbal communication, while most imagined speech decoding approaches remain limited to offline analysis or computationally demanding models. To address this limitation, we propose a two-session experimental framework consisting of an offline data acquisition phase and a subsequent online feedback phase for real-time imagined speech decoding. The paradigm employed a four-class Korean-language task, including three imagined speech targets selected according to the participant's daily communicative needs and a resting-state condition, and was evaluated in a single individual with chronic anomic aphasia. Within this framework, we introduce a lightweight diffusion-based neural decoding model explicitly optimized for real-time inference, achieved through architectural simplifications such as dimensionality reduction, temporal kernel optimization, group normalization with regularization, and dual early-stopping criteria. In real-time evaluation, the proposed system achieved 65 percent top-1 and 70 percent top-2 accuracy, with the Water class reaching 80 percent top-1 and 100 percent top-2 accuracy. These results demonstrate that real-time-optimized diffusion-based architectures, combined with clinically grounded task design, can support feasible online imagined speech decoding for communication-oriented BCI applications in aphasia.

### Knowledge Reasoning of Large Language Models Integrating Graph-Structured Information for Pest and Disease Control in Tobacco
**Authors**: Siyu Li, Chenwei Song, Wan Zhou, Xinyi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:48:38Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

### Testing Conditional Independence via the Spectral Generalized Covariance Measure: Beyond Euclidean Data
**Authors**: Ryunosuke Miyazaki, Yoshimasa Uematsu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:42:53Z

**Summary**: We propose a conditional independence (CI) test based on a new measure, the \emph{spectral generalized covariance measure} (SGCM). The SGCM is constructed by approximating the basis expansion of the squared norm of the conditional cross-covariance operator, using data-dependent bases obtained via spectral decompositions of empirical covariance operators. This construction avoids direct estimation of conditional mean embeddings and reduces the problem to scalar-valued regressions, resulting in robust finite-sample size control. Theoretically, we derive the limiting distribution of the SGCM statistic, establish the validity of a wild bootstrap for inference, and obtain uniform asymptotic size control under doubly robust conditions. As an additional contribution, we show that exponential kernels induced by continuous semimetrics of negative type are characteristic on general Polish spaces -- with extensions to finite tensor products -- thereby providing a foundation for applying our test and other kernel methods to complex objects such as distribution-valued data and curves on metric spaces. Extensive simulations indicate that the SGCM-based CI test attains near-nominal size and exhibits power competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art alternatives across a range of challenging scenarios.

### LIME:Accelerating Collaborative Lossless LLM Inference on Memory-Constrained Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mingyu Sun, Xiao Zhang, Shen Qu, Yan Li, Mengbai Xiao, Yuan Yuan, Dongxiao Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:41:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for intelligent reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating substantial impact across a wide range of domains and applications. However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.

### Optimal estimation for regression discontinuity design with binary outcomes
**Authors**: Takuya Ishihara, Masayuki Sawada, Kohei Yata

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:35:39Z

**Summary**: We develop a finite-sample optimal estimator for regression discontinuity design when the outcomes are bounded, including binary outcomes as the leading case. Our estimator achieves minimax mean squared error among linear shrinkage estimators with nonnegative weights when the regression function lies in a Lipschitz class. Although the original minimax problem involves an iterative noncovex optimization problem, we show that our estimator is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. A key advantage of the proposed estimator is that the Lipschitz constant is its only tuning parameter. We also propose a uniformly valid inference procedure without a large-sample approximation. In a simulation exercise for small samples, our estimator exhibits smaller mean squared errors and shorter confidence intervals than those of conventional large-sample techniques. In an empirical multi-cutoff design in which the sample size for each cutoff is small, our method yields informative confidence intervals, in contrast to the leading large-sample approach.

### Contextual Biasing for LLM-Based ASR with Hotword Retrieval and Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: YuXiang Kong, JunFeng Hou, Jian Tang, Bingqing Zhu, Jicheng Zhang, Shaofei Xue

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:10:09Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet contextual biasing for named entities and hotwords under large vocabularies remains challenging. In this work, we propose a scalable two-stage framework that integrates hotword retrieval with LLM-ASR adaptation. First, we extend the Global-Local Contrastive Language-Audio pre-trained model (GLCLAP) to retrieve a compact top-k set of hotword candidates from a large vocabulary via robustness-aware data augmentation and fuzzy matching. Second, we inject the retrieved candidates as textual prompts into an LLM-ASR model and fine-tune it with Generative Rejection-Based Policy Optimization (GRPO), using a task-driven reward that jointly optimizes hotword recognition and overall transcription accuracy. Experiments on hotword-focused test sets show substantial keyword error rate (KER) reductions while maintaining sentence accuracy on general ASR benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-vocabulary contextual biasing.

### Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Qihao Liu, Luoxin Ye, Wufei Ma, Yu-Cheng Chou, Alan Yuille

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:03:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

### Surrogate-Powered Inference: Regularization and Adaptivity
**Authors**: Jianmin Chen, Huiyuan Wang, Thomas Lumley, Xiaowu Dai, Yong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T01:48:59Z

**Summary**: High-quality labeled data are essential for reliable statistical inference, but are often limited by validation costs. While surrogate labels provide cost-effective alternatives, their noise can introduce non-negligible bias. To address this challenge, we propose the surrogate-powered inference (SPI) toolbox, a unified framework that leverages both the validity of high-quality labels and the abundance of surrogates to enable reliable statistical inference. SPI comprises three progressively enhanced versions. Base-SPI integrates validated labels and surrogates through augmentation to improve estimation efficiency. SPI+ incorporates regularized regression to safely handle multiple surrogates, preventing performance degradation due to error accumulation. SPI++ further optimizes efficiency under limited validation budgets through an adaptive, multiwave labeling procedure that prioritizes informative subjects for labeling. Compared to traditional methods, SPI substantially reduces the estimation error and increases the power in risk factor identification. These results demonstrate the value of SPI in improving the reproducibility. Theoretical guarantees and extensive simulation studies further illustrate the properties of our approach.

### Batched Training for QLSTM vs. QFWP: A System-Oriented Approach to EPC-Aware RMSE-DA
**Authors**: Jun-Hao Chen, Ming-Kai Hung, Yun-Cheng Tsai, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T01:19:19Z

**Summary**: We compare two quantum sequence models, QLSTM and QFWP, under an Equal Parameter Count (EPC) and adjoint differentiation setup on daily EUR USD forecasting as a controlled one dimensional time series case study. Across 10 random seeds and batch sizes from 4 to 64, we measure component wise runtimes including train forward, backward, full train, and inference, as well as accuracy including RMSE and directional accuracy. Batched forward scales well by about 2.2 to 2.4 times, but backward scales modestly, with QLSTM about 1.01 to 1.05 times and QFWP about 1.18 to 1.22 times, which caps end to end training speedups near 2 times. QFWP achieves lower RMSE and higher directional accuracy at all batch sizes, supported by a Wilcoxon test with p less than or equal to 0.004 and a large Cliff delta, while QLSTM reaches the highest throughput at batch size 64, revealing a clear speed accuracy Pareto frontier. We provide an EPC aligned, numerically checked benchmarking pipeline and practical guidance on batch size choices, while broader datasets and hardware and noise settings are left for future work.

### Analyzing Code Injection Attacks on LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems in Software Development
**Authors**: Brian Bowers, Smita Khapre, Jugal Kalita

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T01:08:43Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems are poised to dominate industry and society imminently. Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.

### Method Decoration (DeMe): A Framework for LLM-Driven Adaptive Method Generation in Dynamic IoT Environments
**Authors**: Hong Su

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T01:08:40Z

**Summary**: Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

### S$^2$Edit: Text-Guided Image Editing with Precise Semantic and Spatial Control
**Authors**: Xudong Liu, Zikun Chen, Ruowei Jiang, Ziyi Wu, Kejia Yin, Han Zhao, Parham Aarabi, Igor Gilitschenski

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T00:37:39Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts. In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such as makeup transfer.

### On The Conceptualization and Societal Impact of Cross-Cultural Bias
**Authors**: Vitthal Bhandari

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T00:27:53Z

**Summary**: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.   Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

### ChatGPT: Excellent Paper! Accept It. Editor: Imposter Found! Review Rejected
**Authors**: Kanchon Gharami, Sanjiv Kumar Sarkar, Yongxin Liu, Shafika Showkat Moni

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T23:50:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are now widely used in writing and reviewing scientific papers. While this trend accelerates publication growth and reduces human workload, it also introduces serious risks. Papers written or reviewed by LLMs may lack real novelty, contain fabricated or biased results, or mislead downstream research that others depend on. Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or "jailbreak" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an "inject-and-detect" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment. The goal is to expose how fragile today's peer-review process becomes under LLM influence and how editorial awareness can help restore trust in scientific evaluation.

### Estimation and Inference for Causal Explainability
**Authors**: Weihan Zhang, Zijun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T23:47:21Z

**Summary**: Understanding how much each variable contributes to an outcome is a central question across disciplines. A causal view of explainability is favorable for its ability in uncovering underlying mechanisms and generalizing to new contexts. Based on a family of causal explainability quantities, we develop methods for their estimation and inference. In particular, we construct a one-step correction estimator using semi-parametric efficiency theory, which explicitly leverages the independence structure of variables to reduce the asymptotic variance. For a null hypothesis on the boundary, i.e., zero explainability, we show its equivalence to Fisher's sharp null, which motivates a randomization-based inference procedure. Finally, we illustrate the empirical efficacy of our approach through simulations as well as an immigration experiment dataset, where we investigate how features and their interactions shape public opinion toward admitting immigrants.

### A Comparison of DeepSeek and Other LLMs
**Authors**: Tianchen Gao, Jiashun Jin, Zheng Tracy Ke, Gabriel Moryoussef

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T23:20:44Z

**Summary**: Recently, DeepSeek has been the focus of attention in and beyond the AI community. An interesting problem is how DeepSeek compares to other large language models (LLMs). There are many tasks an LLM can do, and in this paper, we use the task of "predicting an outcome using a short text" for comparison. We consider two settings, an authorship classification setting and a citation classification setting. In the first one, the goal is to determine whether a short text is written by human or AI. In the second one, the goal is to classify a citation to one of four types using the textual content. For each experiment, we compare DeepSeek with $4$ popular LLMs: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama.   We find that, in terms of classification accuracy, DeepSeek outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in most cases, but underperforms Claude. We also find that DeepSeek is comparably slower than others but with a low cost to use, while Claude is much more expensive than all the others. Finally, we find that in terms of similarity, the output of DeepSeek is most similar to those of Gemini and Claude (and among all $5$ LLMs, Claude and Gemini have the most similar outputs).   In this paper, we also present a fully-labeled dataset collected by ourselves, and propose a recipe where we can use the LLMs and a recent data set, MADStat, to generate new data sets. The datasets in our paper can be used as benchmarks for future study on LLMs.

### CellMamba: Adaptive Mamba for Accurate and Efficient Cell Detection
**Authors**: Ruochen Liu, Yi Tian, Jiahao Wang, Hongbin Liu, Xianxu Hou, Jingxin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T23:05:11Z

**Summary**: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency.

### Generative Lecture: Making Lecture Videos Interactive with LLMs and AI Clone Instructors
**Authors**: Hye-Young Jo, Ada Zhao, Xiaoan Liu, Ryo Suzuki

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T22:09:55Z

**Summary**: We introduce Generative Lecture, a concept that makes existing lecture videos interactive through generative AI and AI clone instructors. By leveraging interactive avatars powered by HeyGen, ElevenLabs, and GPT-5, we embed an AI instructor into the video and augment the video content in response to students' questions. This allows students to personalize the lecture material, directly ask questions in the video, and receive tailored explanations generated and delivered by the AI-cloned instructor. From a design elicitation study (N=8), we identified four goals that guided the development of eight system features: 1) on-demand clarification, 2) enhanced visuals, 3) interactive example, 4) personalized explanation, 5) adaptive quiz, 6) study summary, 7) automatic highlight, and 8) adaptive break. We then conducted a user study (N=12) to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the system and collected expert feedback (N=5). The results suggest that our system enables effective two-way communication and supports personalized learning.

**Authors**: Ting-Hao K. Huang, Ryan A. Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Tong Yu, Ting-Yao E. Hsu, Ho Yin, Ng, C. Lee Giles

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T21:39:10Z

**Summary**: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T20:54:41Z

**Summary**: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

### Inference-based GAN Video Generation
**Authors**: Jingbo Yang, Adrian G. Bors

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T20:14:38Z

**Summary**: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

### RefactorCoderQA: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Domain Coding Question Solutions in Cloud and Edge Deployment
**Authors**: Shadikur Rahman, Aroosa Hameed, Gautam Srivastava, Syed Muhammad Danish

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T19:44:09Z

**Summary**: To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that enables a structured multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud and responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of LLMs across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers multiple technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges sourced from Stack Overflow. We propose RefactorCoder-MoE, a fine-tuned mixture-of-experts (MoE) code language model based on DeepSeek-Coder-7B-Instruct, adapted to the RefactorCoderQA benchmark using QLoRA for domain-specific coding question answering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefactorCoder-MoE achieves strong and competitive performance, significantly outperforming all evaluated open-source and commercial baselines, with an overall accuracy of 76.84%.

### Phylogenetics in a warm place: computational aspects of the Tropical Grassmannian
**Authors**: Samir Bhatt, John Sabol, Papri Dey, Matthew J. Penn, David Duchene, Ruriko Yoshida

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T19:06:30Z

**Summary**: Phylogenetic trees provide a fundamental representation of evolutionary relationships, yet the combinatorial explosion of possible tree topologies renders inference computationally challenging. Classical approaches to characterizing tree space, such as the Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space, offer elegant geometric structure but suffer from statistical and computational limitations. An alternative perspective arises from tropical geometry, the tropical Grassmannian tropGr(2,n), introduced by Speyer and Sturmfels, which coincides with phylogenetic tree space. In this paper, we review the structure of the tropical Grassmannian and present algorithmic methods for its computational study, including procedures for sampling from the tropical Grassmannian. Our aim is to make these concepts accessible to evolutionary biologists and computational scientists, and to motivate new research directions at the interface of algebraic geometry and phylogenetic inference.

 ### Agentic Structured Graph Traversal for Root Cause Analysis of Code-related Incidents in Cloud Applications
**Authors**: Shengkun Cui, Rahul Krishna, Saurabh Jha, Ravishankar K. Iyer

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:56:18Z

**Summary**: Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.

### Introducing TrGLUE and SentiTurca: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Turkish General Language Understanding and Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Duygu Altinok

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T18:02:09Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

### Differentially Private Feature Release for Wireless Sensing: Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation on CSI Spectrograms
**Authors**: Ipek Sena Yilmaz, Onur G. Tuncer, Zeynep E. Aksoy, Zeynep Yağmur Baydemir

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:21:55Z

**Summary**: Wi-Fi/RF-based human sensing has achieved remarkable progress with deep learning, yet practical deployments increasingly require feature sharing for cloud analytics, collaborative training, or benchmark evaluation. Releasing intermediate representations such as CSI spectrograms can inadvertently expose sensitive information, including user identity, location, and membership, motivating formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we study differentially private (DP) feature release for wireless sensing and propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation mechanism tailored to the highly non-uniform structure of CSI time-frequency representations. Our pipeline converts CSI to bounded spectrogram features, applies sensitivity control via clipping, estimates task-relevant importance over the time-frequency plane, and allocates a global privacy budget across spectrogram blocks before injecting calibrated Gaussian noise. Experiments on multi-user activity sensing (WiMANS), multi-person 3D pose estimation (Person-in-WiFi 3D), and respiration monitoring (Resp-CSI) show that adaptive allocation consistently improves the privacy-utility frontier over uniform perturbation under the same privacy budget. Our method yields higher accuracy and lower error while substantially reducing empirical leakage in identity and membership inference attacks.

### Unifying Learning Dynamics and Generalization in Transformers Scaling Law
**Authors**: Chiwun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:20:09Z

**Summary**: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.   We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

### Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?
**Authors**: Grgur Kovač, Jérémy Perez, Rémy Portelas, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:12:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

### Laser: Governing Long-Horizon Agentic Search via Structured Protocol and Context Register
**Authors**: Shuting Wang, Qiaolin Xia, Vich Wang, Herberttli, Bobsimons, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T17:05:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have enabled agentic search systems that interleave multi-step reasoning with external tool use. However, existing frameworks largely rely on unstructured natural-language reasoning and accumulate raw intermediate traces in the context, which often leads to unstable reasoning trajectories, context overflow, and degraded performance on complex multi-hop queries. In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion. Experiments on Qwen2.5/3-series models across challenging multi-hop QA datasets show that Laser consistently outperforms existing agentic search baselines under both prompting-only and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating that Laser provides a principled and effective foundation for robust, scalable agentic search.

**Authors**: Alejandro Buitrago López, Alberto Ortega Pastor, David Montoro Aguilera, Mario Fernández Tárraga, Jesús Verdú Chacón, Javier Pastor-Galindo, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T16:56:45Z

**Summary**: Research on online social networks (OSNs) is often hindered by platform opacity, limited access to data, and ethical constraints. Simulation offer a valuable alternative, but existing frameworks frequently lack realism and explainability. This paper presents a simulation framework that models synthetic social networks with agents endowed with demographic-based personality traits and finite-state behavioral automata, enabling realistic and interpretable actions. A generative module powered by a large language model (LLM) produces context-aware social media posts consistent with each agent's profile and memory. In parallel, a red module implements DISARM-inspired workflows to orchestrate disinformation campaigns executed by malicious agents targeting simulated audiences. A Mastodon-based visualization layer supports real-time inspection and post-hoc validation of agent activity within a familiar interface. We evaluate the resulting synthetic social networks using topological metrics and LLM-based content assessments, demonstrating structural, behavioral, and linguistic realism. Overall, the framework enables the creation of customizable and controllable social network environments for studying information dynamics and the effects of disinformation.

### Improving Multi-turn Task Completion in Task-Oriented Dialog Systems via Prompt Chaining and Fine-Grained Feedback
**Authors**: Moghis Fereidouni, Md Sajid Ahmed, Adib Mosharrof, A. B. Siddique

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T16:51:41Z

**Summary**: Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems facilitate users in accomplishing complex, multi-turn tasks through natural language. While instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a range of single-turn NLP tasks, they often struggle with reliable multi-turn task completion in TOD settings, particularly when generating API calls required to interact with external systems. To address this, we introduce RealTOD, a novel framework that improves LLM-based TOD systems through (1) prompt chaining and (2) fine-grained feedback. Prompt chaining enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by automatically synthesizing a schema-aligned in-context example for the target task. Fine-grained feedback verifies each generated API call against the domain schema, identifies specific errors, and provides targeted correction prompts. To evaluate task completion reliability, we introduce full API Call Accuracy as a robust metric, along with detailed sub-metrics to capture common failure modes. We conduct extensive experiments on the SGD and BiTOD benchmarks using four LLMs. RealTOD improves Full API accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art AutoTOD by 37.10% on SGD and supervised learning-based baseline SimpleTOD by 10.32% on BiTOD. Human evaluations further confirm that LLMs integrated with RealTOD achieve superior task completion, fluency, and informativeness compared to existing methods.

### fMRI-LM: Towards a Universal Foundation Model for Language-Aligned fMRI Understanding
**Authors**: Yuxiang Wei, Yanteng Zhang, Xi Xiao, Chengxuan Qian, Tianyang Wang, Vince D. Calhoun

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:54:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.

### Periodic Asynchrony: An Effective Method for Accelerating Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jian Lu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:48:38Z

**Summary**: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.

### Prefill vs. Decode Bottlenecks: SRAM-Frequency Tradeoffs and the Memory-Bandwidth Ceiling
**Authors**: Hannah Atmer, Yuan Yao, Thiemo Voigt, Stefanos Kaxiras

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:42:29Z

**Summary**: Energy consumption dictates the cost and environmental impact of deploying Large Language Models. This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.

### Toward Secure and Compliant AI: Organizational Standards and Protocols for NLP Model Lifecycle Management
**Authors**: Sunil Arora, John Hastings

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:28:20Z

**Summary**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and government, where they handle large volumes of personal and regulated data. However, these systems introduce distinct risks related to security, privacy, and regulatory compliance that are not fully addressed by existing AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces the Secure and Compliant NLP Lifecycle Management Framework (SC-NLP-LMF), a comprehensive six-phase model designed to ensure the secure operation of NLP systems from development to retirement. The framework, developed through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources, aligns with leading standards, including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS. It integrates established methods for bias detection, privacy protection (differential privacy, federated learning), secure deployment, explainability, and secure model decommissioning. A healthcare case study illustrates how SC-NLP-LMF detects emerging terminology drift (e.g., COVID-related language) and guides compliant model updates. The framework offers organizations a practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.

### M2RU: Memristive Minion Recurrent Unit for On-Chip Continual Learning at the Edge
**Authors**: Abdullah M. Zyarah, Dhireesha Kudithipudi

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T15:06:09Z

**Summary**: Continual learning on edge platforms remains challenging because recurrent networks depend on energy-intensive training procedures and frequent data movement that are impractical for embedded deployments. This work introduces M2RU, a mixed-signal architecture that implements the minion recurrent unit for efficient temporal processing with on-chip continual learning. The architecture integrates weighted-bit streaming, which enables multi-bit digital inputs to be processed in crossbars without high-resolution conversion, and an experience replay mechanism that stabilizes learning under domain shifts. M2RU achieves 15 GOPS at 48.62 mW, corresponding to 312 GOPS per watt, and maintains accuracy within 5 percent of software baselines on sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Compared with a CMOS digital design, the accelerator provides 29X improvement in energy efficiency. Device-aware analysis shows an expected operational lifetime of 12.2 years under continual learning workloads. These results establish M2RU as a scalable and energy-efficient platform for real-time adaptation in edge-level temporal intelligence.

### MAI-UI Technical Report: Real-World Centric Foundation GUI Agents
**Authors**: Hanzhang Zhou, Xu Zhang, Panrong Tong, Jianan Zhang, Liangyu Chen, Quyu Kong, Chenglin Cai, Chen Liu, Yue Wang, Jingren Zhou, Steven Hoi

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:51:52Z

**Summary**: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro.

**Authors**: Tong Xia, Jiankun Zhang, Ruiwen You, Ao Xu, Linghao Zhang, Tengyao Tu, Jingzhi Wang, Jinghua Piao, Yunke Zhang, Fengli Xu, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:38:22Z

**Summary**: Urban research aims to understand how cities operate and evolve as complex adaptive systems. With the rapid growth of urban data and analytical methodologies, the central challenge of the field has shifted from data availability to the integration of heterogeneous data into coherent, verifiable urban knowledge through multidisciplinary approaches. Recent advances in AI, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have enabled the development of AI scientists capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis generation, and data-driven experimentation, demonstrating substantial potential for autonomous urban research. However, most general-purpose AI systems remain misaligned with the domain-specific knowledge, methodological conventions, and inferential standards required in urban studies. Here, we introduce the AI Urban Scientist, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework designed to support autonomous urban research. Grounded in hypotheses, peer-review feedback, datasets, and research methodologies distilled from large-scale prior studies, the system constructs structured domain knowledge that guides LLM-based agents to automatically generate hypotheses, identify and integrate multi-source urban datasets, conduct empirical analyses and simulations, and iteratively refine analytical methods. Through this process, the framework synthesizes new insights in urban science and accelerates the urban research lifecycle.

### HALF: Process Hollowing Analysis Framework for Binary Programs with the Assistance of Kernel Modules
**Authors**: Zhangbo Long, Letian Sha, Jiaye Pan, Dongpeng Xu, Yifei Huang, Fu Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:34:30Z

**Summary**: Binary program analysis is still very important in system security. There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs. The effectiveness of the framework is also verified by the analysis of actual exploit programs and malicious code, demonstrating the value of the practical application.

### Unveiling the Learning Mind of Language Models: A Cognitive Framework and Empirical Study
**Authors**: Zhengyu Hu, Jianxun Lian, Zheyuan Xiao, Seraphina Zhang, Tianfu Wang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Xing Xie, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:33:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

### Robust Federated Fine-Tuning in Heterogeneous Networks with Unreliable Connections: An Aggregation View
**Authors**: Yanmeng Wang, Zhiwen Dai, Shuai Wang, Jian Zhou, Fu Xiao, Tony Q. S. Quek, Tsung-Hui Chang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:11:17Z

**Summary**: Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization.

### Context-Aware Intelligent Chatbot Framework Leveraging Mobile Sensing
**Authors**: Ziyan Zhang, Nan Gao, Zhiqiang Nie, Shantanu Pal, Haining Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T14:04:26Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), intelligent conversational assistants have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, they still mainly rely on explicit textual input and do not know the real world behaviors of users. This paper proposes a context-sensitive conversational assistant framework grounded in mobile sensing data. By collecting user behavior and environmental data through smartphones, we abstract these signals into 16 contextual scenarios and translate them into natural language prompts, thus improving the model's understanding of the user's state. We design a structured prompting system to guide the LLM in generating a more personalized and contextually relevant dialogue. This approach integrates mobile sensing with large language models, demonstrating the potential of passive behavioral data in intelligent conversation and offering a viable path toward digital health and personalized interaction.

### Meta-Learning-Based Handover Management in NextG O-RAN
**Authors**: Michail Kalntis, George Iosifidis, José Suárez-Varela, Andra Lutu, Fernando A. Kuipers

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T13:01:46Z

**Summary**: While traditional handovers (THOs) have served as a backbone for mobile connectivity, they increasingly suffer from failures and delays, especially in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios.

### BeDKD: Backdoor Defense based on Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Directional Mapping Modulator
**Authors**: Zhengxian Wu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Yinghan Zhou, Changtong dou, Yiming Xue

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T12:28:29Z

**Summary**: Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Backdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial Knowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without significantly reducing the CACC. Our code are available in https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/BeDKD.

### ToTRL: Unlock LLM Tree-of-Thoughts Reasoning Potential through Puzzles Solving
**Authors**: Haoyuan Wu, Xueyi Chen, Rui Ming, Jilong Gao, Shoubo Hu, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T12:24:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection. The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

### Look Closer! An Adversarial Parametric Editing Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in VLMs
**Authors**: Jiayu Hu, Beibei Li, Jiangwei Xia, Yanjun Qin, Bing Ji, Zhongshi He

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:56:45Z

**Summary**: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/hujiayu1223/ALEAHallu.

**Authors**: Shashi Kant Gupta, Arijeet Pramanik, Jerrin John Thomas, Regina Schwind, Lauren Wiener, Avi Raju, Jeremy Kornbluth, Yanshan Wang, Zhaohui Su, Hrituraj Singh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:32:02Z

**Summary**: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

### Transformer Driven Visual Servoing for Fabric Texture Matching Using Dual-Arm Manipulator
**Authors**: Fuyuki Tokuda, Akira Seino, Akinari Kobayashi, Kai Tang, Kazuhiro Kosuge

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:24:11Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.

### AI-Enhanced Real-Time Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair
**Authors**: Yuxuan Liu, Chiya Zhang, Yifeng Yuan, Chunlong He, Weizheng Zhang, Gaojie Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:22:56Z

**Summary**: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. Building on these insights, we developed a real-time, AI-based Wi-Fi sensing and visualization system using a single transceiver pair, and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization. The system operates in real time on commodity hardware, and experimental results confirm our theoretical findings.

### A Lightweight Multi-Scale Attention Framework for Real-Time Spinal Endoscopic Instance Segmentation
**Authors**: Qi Lai, JunYan Li, Qiang Cai, Lei Wang, Tao Yan, XiaoKun Liang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:07:06Z

**Summary**: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark. Code and dataset: https://github.com/hhwmortal/PELD-Instance-segmentation.

### Super-LIO: A Robust and Efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry System with a Compact Mapping Strategy
**Authors**: Liansheng Wang, Xinke Zhang, Chenhui Li, Dongjiao He, Yihan Pan, Jianjun Yi

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:05:45Z

**Summary**: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous systems, yet its deployment on resource-constrained platforms remains challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO, a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/Liansheng-Wang/Super-LIO.git

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T11:02:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:41:25Z

**Summary**: Motion blur caused by camera or object movement severely degrades image quality and poses challenges for real-time applications such as autonomous driving, UAV perception, and medical imaging. In this paper, a lightweight U-shaped network tailored for real-time deblurring is presented and named RT-Focuser. To balance speed and accuracy, we design three key components: Lightweight Deblurring Block (LD) for edge-aware feature extraction, Multi-Level Integrated Aggregation module (MLIA) for encoder integration, and Cross-source Fusion Block (X-Fuse) for progressive decoder refinement. Trained on a single blurred input, RT-Focuser achieves 30.67 dB PSNR with only 5.85M parameters and 15.76 GMACs. It runs 6ms per frame on GPU and mobile, exceeds 140 FPS on both, showing strong potential for deployment on the edge. The official code and usage are available on: https://github.com/ReaganWu/RT-Focuser.

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T10:37:24Z

**Summary**: The energy optimization and demand side management (DSM) of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled microgrids are being transformed by generative artificial intelligence, such as large language models (LLMs). This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, and emphasizes their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) as a representative example of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). We investigate challenges and solutions associated with DSM and explore the new opportunities presented by leveraging LLMs. Then, we propose an innovative solution that enhances LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for automatic problem formulation, code generation, and customizing optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, and highlight our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability. This work shows LLMs' potential in energy optimization of the IoT-enabled microgrids and promotes intelligent DSM solutions.

### MISA: Memory-Efficient LLMs Optimization with Module-wise Importance Sampling
**Authors**: Yuxi Liu, Renjia Deng, Yutong He, Xue Wang, Tao Yao, Kun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T09:58:16Z

**Summary**: The substantial memory demands of pre-training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) require memory-efficient optimization algorithms. One promising approach is layer-wise optimization, which treats each transformer block as a single layer and optimizes it sequentially, while freezing the other layers to save optimizer states and activations. Although effective, these methods ignore the varying importance of the modules within each layer, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, layer-wise sampling provides only limited memory savings, as at least one full layer must remain active during optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA), a novel method that divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns importance scores to each module. MISA uses a weighted random sampling mechanism to activate modules, provably reducing gradient variance compared to layer-wise sampling. Additionally, we establish an \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\) convergence rate under non-convex and stochastic conditions, where $K$ is the total number of block updates, and provide a detailed memory analysis showcasing MISA's superiority over existing baseline methods. Experiments on diverse learning tasks validate the effectiveness of MISA. Source code is available at https://github.com/pkumelon/MISA.

### Broken Words, Broken Performance: Effect of Tokenization on Performance of LLMs
**Authors**: Sachin Pawar, Manoj Apte, Kshitij Jadhav, Girish Keshav Palshikar, Nitin Ramrakhiyani

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T09:16:33Z

**Summary**: Tokenization is the first step in training any Large Language Model (LLM), where the text is split into a sequence of tokens as per the model's fixed vocabulary. This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of "natural" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits "martial" into "mart" and "ial"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse NLP tasks. Extensive research has explored how to enhance the logical reasoning abilities such as Chain-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency, Tree-Of-Thoughts, and multi-agent debates. In the context of multi-agent debates, significant performance improvements can be achieved with an increasing number of agents and debate rounds. However, the escalation in the number of agents and debate rounds can drastically raise the tokens cost of debates, thereby limiting the scalability of the multi-agent debate technique. To better harness the advantages of multi-agent debates in logical reasoning tasks, this paper proposes a method to significantly reduce token cost in multi-agent debates. This approach involves dividing all agents into multiple debate groups, with agents engaging in debates within their respective groups and sharing interim debate results between groups. Comparative experiments across multiple datasets have demonstrated that this method can reduce the total tokens by up to 51.7% during debates and while potentially enhancing accuracy by as much as 25%. Our method significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of interactions in the multi-agent debate.

### Advancing Expert Specialization for Better MoE
**Authors**: Hongcan Guo, Haolang Lu, Guoshun Nan, Bolun Chu, Jialin Zhuang, Yuan Yang, Wenhao Che, Sicong Leng, Qimei Cui, Xudong Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:46:16Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

### Evaluating Large Language Models for Line-Level Vulnerability Localization
**Authors**: Jian Zhang, Chong Wang, Anran Li, Weisong Sun, Cen Zhang, Wei Ma, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:03:04Z

**Summary**: Recently, Automated Vulnerability Localization (AVL) has attracted growing attention, aiming to facilitate diagnosis by pinpointing the specific lines of code responsible for vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in various domains, yet their effectiveness in line-level vulnerability localization remains underexplored.   In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical evaluation of LLMs for AVL. Our study examines 19 leading LLMs suitable for code analysis, including ChatGPT and multiple open-source models, spanning encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, with model sizes from 60M to 70B parameters. We evaluate three paradigms including few-shot prompting, discriminative fine-tuning, and generative fine-tuning with and without Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), on both a BigVul-derived dataset for C/C++ and a smart contract vulnerability dataset.}   Our results show that discriminative fine-tuning achieves substantial performance gains over existing learning-based AVL methods when sufficient training data is available. In low-data settings, prompting advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT proves more effective. We also identify challenges related to input length and unidirectional context during fine-tuning, and propose two remedial strategies: a sliding window approach and right-forward embedding, both of which yield significant improvements. Moreover, we provide the first assessment of LLM generalizability in AVL, showing that certain models can transfer effectively across Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and projects. However, performance degrades notably for newly discovered vulnerabilities containing unfamiliar lexical or structural patterns, underscoring the need for continual adaptation.

### Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs
**Authors**: Yafeng Tang, Xiaoou Ding, Jianzhuo Du, Zishuo Yan, Zhuang Ma, Zheng Liang, Zekai Qian, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T08:02:51Z

**Summary**: Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data. Code is available at https://github.com/windblow32/DATE.

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:55:37Z

**Summary**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to interact with external tools, yet empirical research on MCP is hindered by the lack of large-scale, accessible datasets. We present MCPZoo, the largest and most comprehensive dataset of MCP servers collected from multiple public sources, comprising 129,059 servers (56,053 distinct). MCPZoo includes 16,356 server instances that have been deployed and verified as runnable and interactable, supporting realistic experimentation beyond static analysis. The dataset provides unified metadata and access interfaces, enabling systematic exploration and interaction without manual deployment effort. MCPZoo is released as an open and accessible resource to support research on MCP-based systems and security analysis.

### Accelerate Speculative Decoding with Sparse Computation in Verification
**Authors**: Jikai Wang, Jianchao Tan, Yuxuan Hu, Jiayu Qin, Yerui Sun, Yuchen Xie, Xunliang Cai, Juntao Li, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:53:41Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive language model inference by verifying multiple draft tokens in parallel. However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.

### X-Boundary: Establishing Exact Safety Boundary to Shield LLMs from Multi-Turn Jailbreaks without Compromising Usability
**Authors**: Xiaoya Lu, Dongrui Liu, Yi Yu, Luxin Xu, Jing Shao

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:50:47Z

**Summary**: Despite the rapid development of safety alignment techniques for LLMs, defending against multi-turn jailbreaks is still a challenging task. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing defense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks but compromise usability, i.e., reducing general capabilities or causing the over-refusal problem. From the perspective of mechanism interpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a boundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations. Therefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are inevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability. To address this issue, we propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe representations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. In this way, harmful representations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones. Experimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate by about 20% and maintaining nearly complete general capability. Furthermore, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that X-Boundary can accelerate the convergence process during training. Please see our code at: https://github.com/AI45Lab/X-Boundary.

### The Cultural Gene of Large Language Models: A Study on the Impact of Cross-Corpus Training on Model Values and Biases
**Authors**: Emanuel Z. Fenech-Borg, Tilen P. Meznaric-Kos, Milica D. Lekovic-Bojovic, Arni J. Hentze-Djurhuus

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:30:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200 prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions: Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx -1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI) against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural hegemony.

### Explainable Statute Prediction via Attention-based Model and LLM Prompting
**Authors**: Sachin Pawar, Girish Keshav Palshikar, Anindita Sinha Banerjee, Nitin Ramrakhiyani, Basit Ali

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:29:51Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term "statute" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.

### Computational Economics in Large Language Models: Exploring Model Behavior and Incentive Design under Resource Constraints
**Authors**: Sandeep Reddy, Kabir Khan, Rohit Patil, Ananya Chakraborty, Faizan A. Khan, Swati Kulkarni, Arjun Verma, Neha Singh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T07:02:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost. We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First, we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs under strict resource constraints.

### DySK-Attn: A Framework for Efficient, Real-Time Knowledge Updating in Large Language Models via Dynamic Sparse Knowledge Attention
**Authors**: Kabir Khan, Priya Sharma, Arjun Mehta, Neha Gupta, Ravi Narayanan

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:46:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search, efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the ever-changing world.

### Ensembling Multiple Hallucination Detectors Trained on VLLM Internal Representations
**Authors**: Yuto Nakamizo, Ryuhei Miyazato, Hikaru Tanabe, Ryuta Yamakura, Kiori Hatanaka

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:42:50Z

**Summary**: This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top entries on the final leaderboard.

### "It's the only thing I can trust": Envisioning Large Language Model Use by Autistic Workers for Communication Assistance
**Authors**: JiWoong Jang, Sanika Moharana, Patrick Carrington, Andrew Begel

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:28:24Z

**Summary**: Autistic adults often experience stigma and discrimination at work, leading them to seek social communication support from coworkers, friends, and family despite emotional risks. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered an alternative. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of LLM use by autistic adults at work and explore opportunities and risks of LLMs as a source of social communication advice. We asked 11 autistic participants to present questions about their own workplace-related social difficulties to (1) a GPT-4-based chatbot and (2) a disguised human confederate. Our evaluation shows that participants strongly preferred LLM over confederate interactions. However, a coach specializing in supporting autistic job-seekers raised concerns that the LLM was dispensing questionable advice. We highlight how this divergence in participant and practitioner attitudes reflects existing schisms in HCI on the relative privileging of end-user wants versus normative good and propose design considerations for LLMs to center autistic experiences.

### Optimizing Resource Allocation for Geographically-Distributed Inference by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tingyang Sun, Ting He, Bo Ji, Parimal Parag

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:13:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.

### MASFIN: A Multi-Agent System for Decomposed Financial Reasoning and Forecasting
**Authors**: Marc S. Montalvo, Hamed Yaghoobian

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T06:01:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are transforming data-intensive domains, with finance representing a high-stakes environment where transparent and reproducible analysis of heterogeneous signals is essential. Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.

### CricBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Cricket Analytics
**Authors**: Vaibhav Devraj, Dhruv Kumar, Jagat Sesh Challa

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T05:59:19Z

**Summary**: Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a "Gold Standard" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.

### Secure and Explainable Fraud Detection in Finance via Hierarchical Multi-source Dataset Distillation
**Authors**: Yiming Qian, Thorsten Neumann, Xueyining Huang, David Hardoon, Fei Gao, Yong Liu, Siow Mong Rick Goh

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T05:00:35Z

**Summary**: We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.   On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).   Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.

### Inducing Causal World Models in LLMs for Zero-Shot Physical Reasoning
**Authors**: Aditya Sharma, Ananya Gupta, Chengyu Wang, Chiamaka Adebayo, Jakub Kowalski

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:52:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

### TimeBill: Time-Budgeted Inference for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qi Fan, An Zou, Yehan Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:49:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

### Fast Inference of Visual Autoregressive Model with Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees
**Authors**: Haodong Lei, Hongsong Wang, Xin Geng, Liang Wang, Pan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:45:49Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/Haodong-Lei-Ray/ADT-Tree.

**Authors**: Anjali R. Menon, Rohit K. Sharma, Priya Singh, Chengyu Wang, Aurora M. Ferreira, Mateja Novak

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:45:12Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.

### Video Event Reasoning and Prediction by Fusing World Knowledge from LLMs with Vision Foundation Models
**Authors**: L'ea Dubois, Klaus Schmidt, Chengyu Wang, Ji-Hoon Park, Lin Wang, Santiago Munoz

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:37:45Z

**Summary**: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.

### SlowFast-SCI: Slow-Fast Deep Unfolding Learning for Spectral Compressive Imaging
**Authors**: Haijin Zeng, Xuan Lu, Yurong Zhang, Qiangqiang Shen, Guoqing Chao, Li Jiang, Yongyong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:24:43Z

**Summary**: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/XuanLu11/SlowFast-SCI.

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:22:28Z

**Summary**: The allure of lunar surface exploration and development has recently captured widespread global attention. Robots have proved to be indispensable for exploring uncharted terrains, uncovering and leveraging local resources, and facilitating the construction of future human habitats. In this article, we introduce the modular and on-demand reconfigurable robot (MoonBot), a modular and reconfigurable robotic system engineered to maximize functionality while operating within the stringent mass constraints of lunar payloads and adapting to varying environmental conditions and task requirements. This article details the design and development of MoonBot and presents a preliminary field demonstration that validates the proof of concept through the execution of milestone tasks simulating the establishment of lunar infrastructure. These tasks include essential civil engineering operations, infrastructural component transportation and deployment, and assistive operations with inflatable modules. Furthermore, we systematically summarize the lessons learned during testing, focusing on the connector design and providing valuable insights for the advancement of modular robotic systems in future lunar missions.

### A Comedy of Estimators: On KL Regularization in RL Training of LLMs

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T04:20:58Z

**Summary**: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

### HeartBench: Probing Core Dimensions of Anthropomorphic Intelligence in LLMs
**Authors**: Jiaxin Liu, Peiyi Tu, Wenyu Chen, Yihong Zhuang, Xinxia Ling, Anji Zhou, Chenxi Wang, Zhuo Han, Zhengkai Yang, Junbo Zhao, Zenan Huang, Yuanyuan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:54:56Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

### StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion
**Authors**: Yutong Wu, Di Huang, Ruosi Wan, Yue Peng, Shijie Shang, Chenrui Cao, Lei Qi, Rui Zhang, Zidong Du, Jie Yan, Xing Hu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:12:16Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

### AlignAR: Generative Sentence Alignment for Arabic-English Parallel Corpora of Legal and Literary Texts
**Authors**: Baorong Huang, Ali Asiri

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T03:10:43Z

**Summary**: High-quality parallel corpora are essential for Machine Translation (MT) research and translation teaching. However, Arabic-English resources remain scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings. In this paper, we present AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and a new Arabic-English dataset comprising complex legal and literary texts. Our evaluation demonstrates that "Easy" datasets lack the discriminatory power to fully assess alignment methods. By reducing one-to-one mappings in our "Hard" subset, we exposed the limitations of traditional alignment methods. In contrast, LLM-based approaches demonstrated superior robustness, achieving an overall F1-score of 85.5%, a 9% improvement over previous methods. Our datasets and codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/XXX.

### Knowledge Reasoning of Large Language Models Integrating Graph-Structured Information for Pest and Disease Control in Tobacco
**Authors**: Siyu Li, Chenwei Song, Wan Zhou, Xinyi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:48:38Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

### LIME:Accelerating Collaborative Lossless LLM Inference on Memory-Constrained Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mingyu Sun, Xiao Zhang, Shen Qu, Yan Li, Mengbai Xiao, Yuan Yuan, Dongxiao Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:41:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for intelligent reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating substantial impact across a wide range of domains and applications. However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.

### Contextual Biasing for LLM-Based ASR with Hotword Retrieval and Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: YuXiang Kong, JunFeng Hou, Jian Tang, Bingqing Zhu, Jicheng Zhang, Shaofei Xue

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:10:09Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet contextual biasing for named entities and hotwords under large vocabularies remains challenging. In this work, we propose a scalable two-stage framework that integrates hotword retrieval with LLM-ASR adaptation. First, we extend the Global-Local Contrastive Language-Audio pre-trained model (GLCLAP) to retrieve a compact top-k set of hotword candidates from a large vocabulary via robustness-aware data augmentation and fuzzy matching. Second, we inject the retrieved candidates as textual prompts into an LLM-ASR model and fine-tune it with Generative Rejection-Based Policy Optimization (GRPO), using a task-driven reward that jointly optimizes hotword recognition and overall transcription accuracy. Experiments on hotword-focused test sets show substantial keyword error rate (KER) reductions while maintaining sentence accuracy on general ASR benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-vocabulary contextual biasing.

### Securing Cross-Domain Internet of Drones: An RFF-PUF Allied Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol With Over-the-Air Enrollment
**Authors**: Xuanyu Chen, Yue Zheng, Junqing Zhang, Guanxiong Shen, Chip-Hong Chang

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:04:24Z

**Summary**: The Internet of Drones (IoD) is an emerging and crucial paradigm enabling advanced applications that require seamless, secure communication across heterogeneous and untrusted domains. In such environments, access control and the transmission of sensitive data pose significant security challenges for IoD systems, necessitating the design of lightweight mutual authentication and key exchange protocols. Existing solutions are often hampered by high computation overhead, reliance on third parties, the requirement for secret storage in resource-constrained drones, and the need for a strictly controlled enrollment environment. These limitations make them impractical for dynamic cross-domain deployment. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight mutual authentication mechanism that integrates Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technologies for secure drone-to-drone (D2D) and drone-to-ground station server (D2G) communication. RFF-based device identification is used to achieve over-the-air (OTA) enrollment, while the PUF serves as the root of trust for establishing mutual authentication among communication parties. Additionally, the on-the-fly key generation capability of the PUF is co-designed with One-Time-Pad (OTP) encryption to realize ephemeral keying and eliminate the need for storing secrets within drones. Both informal security analysis and ProVerif-based formal security verification comprehensively demonstrate the resilience of our protocol against common security attacks. The proposed protocol also outperforms existing IoD authentication schemes in terms of security features, as well as computation, communication, and storage overhead.

### Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Qihao Liu, Luoxin Ye, Wufei Ma, Yu-Cheng Chou, Alan Yuille

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T02:03:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

### Analyzing Code Injection Attacks on LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems in Software Development
**Authors**: Brian Bowers, Smita Khapre, Jugal Kalita

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T01:08:43Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems are poised to dominate industry and society imminently. Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.

### Method Decoration (DeMe): A Framework for LLM-Driven Adaptive Method Generation in Dynamic IoT Environments
**Authors**: Hong Su

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T01:08:40Z

**Summary**: Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

### On The Conceptualization and Societal Impact of Cross-Cultural Bias
**Authors**: Vitthal Bhandari

**Updated**: 2025-12-26T00:27:53Z

**Summary**: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.   Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

### ChatGPT: Excellent Paper! Accept It. Editor: Imposter Found! Review Rejected
**Authors**: Kanchon Gharami, Sanjiv Kumar Sarkar, Yongxin Liu, Shafika Showkat Moni

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T23:50:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are now widely used in writing and reviewing scientific papers. While this trend accelerates publication growth and reduces human workload, it also introduces serious risks. Papers written or reviewed by LLMs may lack real novelty, contain fabricated or biased results, or mislead downstream research that others depend on. Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or "jailbreak" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an "inject-and-detect" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment. The goal is to expose how fragile today's peer-review process becomes under LLM influence and how editorial awareness can help restore trust in scientific evaluation.

### A Comparison of DeepSeek and Other LLMs
**Authors**: Tianchen Gao, Jiashun Jin, Zheng Tracy Ke, Gabriel Moryoussef

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T23:20:44Z

**Summary**: Recently, DeepSeek has been the focus of attention in and beyond the AI community. An interesting problem is how DeepSeek compares to other large language models (LLMs). There are many tasks an LLM can do, and in this paper, we use the task of "predicting an outcome using a short text" for comparison. We consider two settings, an authorship classification setting and a citation classification setting. In the first one, the goal is to determine whether a short text is written by human or AI. In the second one, the goal is to classify a citation to one of four types using the textual content. For each experiment, we compare DeepSeek with $4$ popular LLMs: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama.   We find that, in terms of classification accuracy, DeepSeek outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in most cases, but underperforms Claude. We also find that DeepSeek is comparably slower than others but with a low cost to use, while Claude is much more expensive than all the others. Finally, we find that in terms of similarity, the output of DeepSeek is most similar to those of Gemini and Claude (and among all $5$ LLMs, Claude and Gemini have the most similar outputs).   In this paper, we also present a fully-labeled dataset collected by ourselves, and propose a recipe where we can use the LLMs and a recent data set, MADStat, to generate new data sets. The datasets in our paper can be used as benchmarks for future study on LLMs.

### Smart IoT-Based Leak Forecasting and Detection for Energy-Efficient Liquid Cooling in AI Data Centers
**Authors**: Krishna Chaitanya Sunkara, Rambabu Konakanchi

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T22:51:16Z

**Summary**: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.

### Generative Lecture: Making Lecture Videos Interactive with LLMs and AI Clone Instructors
**Authors**: Hye-Young Jo, Ada Zhao, Xiaoan Liu, Ryo Suzuki

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T22:09:55Z

**Summary**: We introduce Generative Lecture, a concept that makes existing lecture videos interactive through generative AI and AI clone instructors. By leveraging interactive avatars powered by HeyGen, ElevenLabs, and GPT-5, we embed an AI instructor into the video and augment the video content in response to students' questions. This allows students to personalize the lecture material, directly ask questions in the video, and receive tailored explanations generated and delivered by the AI-cloned instructor. From a design elicitation study (N=8), we identified four goals that guided the development of eight system features: 1) on-demand clarification, 2) enhanced visuals, 3) interactive example, 4) personalized explanation, 5) adaptive quiz, 6) study summary, 7) automatic highlight, and 8) adaptive break. We then conducted a user study (N=12) to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the system and collected expert feedback (N=5). The results suggest that our system enables effective two-way communication and supports personalized learning.

**Authors**: Ting-Hao K. Huang, Ryan A. Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Tong Yu, Ting-Yao E. Hsu, Ho Yin, Ng, C. Lee Giles

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T21:39:10Z

**Summary**: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

**Summary**: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

### Learning to Sense for Driving: Joint Optics-Sensor-Model Co-Design for Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Reeshad Khan, John Gauch

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T20:26:31Z

**Summary**: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

### RefactorCoderQA: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Domain Coding Question Solutions in Cloud and Edge Deployment
**Authors**: Shadikur Rahman, Aroosa Hameed, Gautam Srivastava, Syed Muhammad Danish

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T19:44:09Z

**Summary**: To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that enables a structured multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud and responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of LLMs across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers multiple technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges sourced from Stack Overflow. We propose RefactorCoder-MoE, a fine-tuned mixture-of-experts (MoE) code language model based on DeepSeek-Coder-7B-Instruct, adapted to the RefactorCoderQA benchmark using QLoRA for domain-specific coding question answering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefactorCoder-MoE achieves strong and competitive performance, significantly outperforming all evaluated open-source and commercial baselines, with an overall accuracy of 76.84%.

### Vox Deorum: A Hybrid LLM Architecture for 4X / Grand Strategy Game AI -- Lessons from Civilization V
**Authors**: John Chen, Sihan Cheng, Can Gurkan, Ryan Lay, Moez Salahuddin

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T18:41:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models' capacity to reason in natural language makes them uniquely promising for 4X and grand strategy games, enabling more natural human-AI gameplay interactions such as collaboration and negotiation. However, these games present unique challenges due to their complexity and long-horizon nature, while latency and cost factors may hinder LLMs' real-world deployment. Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other. Our work establishes a viable architecture for integrating LLMs in commercial 4X games, opening new opportunities for game design and agentic AI research.

### Uncovering Hierarchical Structure in LLM Embeddings with $δ$-Hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining
**Authors**: Prakash Chourasia, Sarwan Ali, Murray Patterson

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T17:36:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant strides in various fields. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $δ$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $δ$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization. Our findings reveal that LLM embeddings exhibit varying degrees of hyperbolicity and ultrametricity, which correlate with their performance in the underlying machine learning tasks.

### Socratic Students: Teaching Language Models to Learn by Asking Questions
**Authors**: Rajeev Bhatt Ambati, Tianyi Niu, Aashu Singh, Shlok Mishra, Snigdha Chaturvedi, Shashank Srivastava

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T17:10:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at static interactions, where they answer user queries by retrieving knowledge encoded in their parameters. However, in many real-world settings, such as educational tutoring or medical assistance, relevant information is not directly available and must be actively acquired through dynamic interactions. An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.

### Knot Forcing: Taming Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models for Real-time Infinite Interactive Portrait Animation
**Authors**: Steven Xiao, XIndi Zhang, Dechao Meng, Qi Wang, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T16:34:56Z

**Summary**: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T16:23:36Z

**Summary**: Geocoding systems are widely used in both scientific research for spatial analysis and everyday life through location-based services. The quality of geocoded data significantly impacts subsequent processes and applications, underscoring the need for next-generation systems. In response to this demand, this review first characterizes the technical requirements for next-generation geocoding inputs and outputs. We then decompose the geocoding workflow into modular functional units and survey existing implementations. For each component, we identify methodological limitations, articulate domain-specific research questions and hypotheses, and outline evaluation strategies needed. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve next-generation geocoding systems in light of recent technological advances. We envision that this review provides a technical foundation and research agenda for advancing the design, assessment, and deployment of next-generation geocoding systems.

### ZIA: A Theoretical Framework for Zero-Input AI
**Authors**: Aditi De, NeuroBits Labs

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T16:05:55Z

**Summary**: Zero-Input AI (ZIA) introduces a novel framework for human-computer interaction by enabling proactive intent prediction without explicit user commands. It integrates gaze tracking, bio-signals (EEG, heart rate), and contextual data (time, location, usage history) into a multi-modal model for real-time inference, targeting <100 ms latency. The proposed architecture employs a transformer-based model with cross-modal attention, variational Bayesian inference for uncertainty estimation, and reinforcement learning for adaptive optimization. To support deployment on edge devices (CPUs, TPUs, NPUs), ZIA utilizes quantization, weight pruning, and linear attention to reduce complexity from quadratic to linear with sequence length. Theoretical analysis establishes an information-theoretic bound on prediction error and demonstrates how multi-modal fusion improves accuracy over single-modal approaches. Expected performance suggests 85-90% accuracy with EEG integration and 60-100 ms inference latency. ZIA provides a scalable, privacy-preserving framework for accessibility, healthcare, and consumer applications, advancing AI toward anticipatory intelligence.

### HELP: Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner for Household Tasks
**Authors**: Alexandr V. Korchemnyi, Anatoly O. Onishchenko, Eva A. Bakaeva, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T15:54:08Z

**Summary**: Embodied agents tasked with complex scenarios, whether in real or simulated environments, rely heavily on robust planning capabilities. When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask. We evaluate the proposed approach on a household task and perform real-world experiments with an embodied agent. We also focus on the use of open source LLMs with a relatively small number of parameters, to enable autonomous deployment.

### CATCH: A Controllable Theme Detection Framework with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation
**Authors**: Rui Ke, Jiahui Xu, Shenghao Yang, Kuang Wang, Feng Jiang, Haizhou Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T15:33:25Z

**Summary**: Theme detection is a fundamental task in user-centric dialogue systems, aiming to identify the latent topic of each utterance without relying on predefined schemas. Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

### A Queueing Theoretic Perspective on Low-Latency LLM Inference with Variable Token Length
**Authors**: Yuqing Yang, Yuedong Xu, Lei Jiao

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T15:23:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) propel the prosperity of interactive AI applications showcased by ChatGPT that demand timely response of inference services. However, LLM inference is computation intensive and memory intensive, and improper parameter configuration at LLM platforms may exacerbate the inference time. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LLM output token distribution on the inference queueing delay, where the max-token clipping and the batched inference are considered. By formulating an M/G/1 model, we observe that enforcing a maximum output token limit on a very small fraction of inference requests can significantly reduce the queueing delay, and our model facilitates the selection of the optimal limit. For the batch inference, we model the service process as a bulk queue in which the batch processing time is affected by the batch size and the maximum token size inside this batch jointly. The queueing delays of the batching of all buffered requests (dynamic batching), the batching of constant number of requests (fixed batching), and the batching without intra-batch waiting (elastic batching) are derived. Experimental results show that our mathematical models coincide with the event-driven simulations well.

### Do Latent Tokens Think? A Causal and Adversarial Analysis of Chain-of-Continuous-Thought
**Authors**: Yuyi Zhang, Boyu Tang, Tianjie Ju, Sufeng Duan, Gongshen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T15:14:53Z

**Summary**: Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

### Detecting AI-Generated Paraphrases in Bengali: A Comparative Study of Zero-Shot and Fine-Tuned Transformers
**Authors**: Md. Rakibul Islam, Most. Sharmin Sultana Samu, Md. Zahid Hossain, Farhad Uz Zaman, Md. Kamrozzaman Bhuiyan

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T15:04:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can produce text that closely resembles human writing. This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.

### MoRAgent: Parameter Efficient Agent Tuning with Mixture-of-Roles
**Authors**: Jing Han, Binwei Yan, Tianyu Guo, Zheyuan Bai, Mengyu Zheng, Hanting Chen, Ying Nie

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T15:02:07Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advancements of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to facilitate agent tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies for agent remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce three key strategies for PEFT in agent tasks: 1) Inspired by the increasingly dominant Reason+Action paradigm, we first decompose the capabilities necessary for the agent tasks into three distinct roles: reasoner, executor, and summarizer. The reasoner is responsible for comprehending the user's query and determining the next role based on the execution trajectory. The executor is tasked with identifying the appropriate functions and parameters to invoke. The summarizer conveys the distilled information from conversations back to the user. 2) We then propose the Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework, which comprises three specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) groups, each designated to fulfill a distinct role. By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification. We conduct extensive experiments and thorough ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This project is publicly available at https://mor-agent.github.io.

### Towards Responsible and Explainable AI Agents with Consensus-Driven Reasoning

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T14:49:25Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

### PIMphony: Overcoming Bandwidth and Capacity Inefficiency in PIM-based Long-Context LLM Inference System

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T14:44:28Z

**Summary**: The expansion of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) creates significant memory system challenges. While Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is a promising accelerator, we identify that it suffers from critical inefficiencies when scaled to long contexts: severe channel underutilization, performance-limiting I/O bottlenecks, and massive memory waste from static KV cache management. In this work, we propose PIMphony, a PIM orchestrator that systematically resolves these issues with three co-designed techniques. First, Token-Centric PIM Partitioning (TCP) ensures high channel utilization regardless of batch size. Second, Dynamic PIM Command Scheduling (DCS) mitigates the I/O bottleneck by overlapping data movement and computation. Finally, a Dynamic PIM Access (DPA) controller enables dynamic memory management to eliminate static memory waste. Implemented via an MLIR-based compiler and evaluated on a cycle-accurate simulator, PIMphony significantly improves throughput for long-context LLM inference (up to 72B parameters and 1M context length). Our evaluations show performance boosts of up to 11.3x on PIM-only systems and 8.4x on xPU+PIM systems, enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world long-context applications.

### SlideChain: Semantic Provenance for Lecture Understanding via Blockchain Registration
**Authors**: Md Motaleb Hossen Manik, Md Zabirul Islam, Ge Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T14:02:27Z

**Summary**: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

### How Robot Dogs See the Unseeable: Improving Visual Interpretability via Peering for Exploratory Robots
**Authors**: Oliver Bimber, Karl Dietrich von Ellenrieder, Michael Haller, Rakesh John Amala Arokia Nathan, Gianni Lunardi, Mohamed Youssef, Marco Camurri, Santos Miguel Orozco Soto, Jeremy E. Niven

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T13:59:00Z

**Summary**: Occlusion from obstacles, such as foliage, can severely obstruct a robot's sensors, impairing scene understanding. We show that "peering", a characteristic side-to-side movement used by insects to overcome their visual limitations, can also allow robots to markedly improve visual reasoning under partial occlusion. This is accomplished by applying core signal processing principles, specifically optical synthetic aperture sensing, together with the vision reasoning capabilities of modern large multimodal models. Peering enables real-time, high-resolution, and wavelength-independent perception, which is crucial for vision-based scene understanding across a wide range of applications. The approach is low-cost and immediately deployable on any camera-equipped robot. We investigated different peering motions and occlusion masking strategies, demonstrating that, unlike peering, state-of-the-art multi-view 3D vision techniques fail in these conditions due to their high susceptibility to occlusion. Robots that see through occlusion will gain superior perception abilities - including enhanced scene understanding, situational awareness, camouflage breaking, and advanced navigation.

**Authors**: Xiang Feng, Wentao Jiang, Zengmao Wang, Yong Luo, Pingbo Xu, Baosheng Yu, Hua Jin, Bo Du, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T13:46:56Z

**Summary**: The application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical field has garnered significant attention, yet their reasoning capabilities in more specialized domains like anesthesiology remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnesSuite, the first comprehensive dataset suite specifically designed for anesthesiology reasoning in LLMs. The suite features AnesBench, an evaluation benchmark tailored to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Alongside this benchmark, the suite includes three training datasets that provide an infrastructure for continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Leveraging this suite, we develop Morpheus, the first baseline model collection for anesthesiology reasoning. Despite undergoing limited training with SFT and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), Morpheus demonstrates substantial performance improvements, rivaling the performance of larger-scale models. Furthermore, through comprehensive evaluations and experiments, we analyze the key factors influencing anesthesiology reasoning performance, including model characteristics, training strategies and training data. Both AnesSuite and Morpheus will be open-sourced at https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesSuite.

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T13:25:47Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.   We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.

### Near-Field Communication with Massive Movable Antennas: An Electrostatic Equilibrium Perspective
**Authors**: Shicong Liu, Xianghao Yu, Shenghui Song, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T13:00:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large-scale position-reconfigurable antennas have opened up new dimensions to effectively utilize the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of wireless channels. However, the deployment of existing antenna placement schemes is primarily hindered by their limited scalability and frequently overlooked near-field effects in large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna placement approach tailored for near-field massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which effectively exploits the spatial DoFs to enhance spectral efficiency. For that purpose, we first reformulate the antenna placement problem in the angular domain, resulting in a weighted Fekete problem. We then derive the optimality condition and reveal that the {optimal} antenna placement is in principle an electrostatic equilibrium problem. To further reduce the computational complexity of numerical optimization, we propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based framework to efficiently solve the equilibrium problem. In particular, the optimal antenna positions are characterized by the roots of the polynomial solutions to specific ODEs in the normalized angular domain. By simply adopting a two-step eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) approach, the optimal antenna positions can be efficiently obtained. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis when the antenna size tends to infinity, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently harnesses the spatial DoFs of near-field channels with prominent gains in spectral efficiency and maintains robustness against system parameter mismatches. In addition, the derived asymptotic closed-form {solution} closely approaches the theoretical optimum across a wide range of practical scenarios.

### Rethinking Output Alignment For 1-bit Post-Training Quantization of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dung Anh Hoang, Cuong Pham, Cuong Nguyen, Trung le, Jianfei Cai, Thanh-Toan Do

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T12:39:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, but their massive sizes hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \(\pm\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.

### TableGPT-R1: Advancing Tabular Reasoning Through Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Saisai Yang, Qingyi Huang, Jing Yuan, Liangyu Zha, Kai Tang, Yuhang Yang, Ning Wang, Yucheng Wei, Liyao Li, Wentao Ye, Hao Chen, Tao Zhang, Junlin Zhou, Haobo Wang, Gang Chen, Junbo Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T12:35:54Z

**Summary**: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/tablegpt/TableGPT-R1.

### Heaven-Sent or Hell-Bent? Benchmarking the Intelligence and Defectiveness of LLM Hallucinations
**Authors**: Chengxu Yang, Jingling Yuan, Siqi Cai, Jiawei Jiang, Chuang Hu

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T11:33:46Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are commonly regarded as errors to be minimized. However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.

### Multiple-play Stochastic Bandits with Prioritized Arm Capacity Sharing
**Authors**: Hong Xie, Haoran Gu, Yanying Huang, Tao Tan, Defu Lian

**Updated**: 2025-12-25T11:19:09Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.
