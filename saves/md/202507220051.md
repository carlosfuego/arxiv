 ### Secretive Hotplug Coded Caching
**Authors**: Mallikharjuna Chinnapadamala, Charul Rajput, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:24:29Z

**Summary**: In this work, we consider a coded caching model called \textit{hotplug coded caching}, in which some users are offline during the delivery phase. The concept of Hotplug Placement Delivery Arrays (HpPDAs) for hotplug coded caching systems has been introduced in the literature, and two classes of HpPDAs are known. In this paper, we consider a secrecy constraint in hotplug coded caching setup, where users should not learn anything about any file from their cache content, and active users should not gain any information about files other than their demanded file from either their cache content or the server transmissions. We propose two secretive schemes for the two classes of HpPDAs and compare them with a baseline scheme, which is a secretive scheme using PDAs for the classical coded caching setup and can be trivially adapted for the hotplug coded caching setup. We numerically show that our schemes outperform the baseline scheme in certain memory regions.

**Summary**: Modeling ultra-long user behavior sequences is critical for capturing both long- and short-term preferences in industrial recommender systems. Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Zhanchao Xu, Yiming Li, Xuejia Chen, Darian Li, Anxin Tian, Qingfa Xiao, Cheng Deng, Jun Wang, Qing Li, Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan

**Summary**: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Error-Optimized Cache
**Authors**: Junxiang Qiu, Shuo Wang, Jinda Lu, Lin Liu, Houcheng Jiang, Xingyu Zhu, Yanbin Hao

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T01:49:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the \textbf{E}rror-\textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}ache (\textbf{EOC}). This method introduces three key improvements: \textbf{(1)} Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; \textbf{(2)} A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; \textbf{(3)} Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching, especially excessive caching. On the ImageNet dataset, without substantially increasing the computational load, this method improves the FID of the generated images when the rule-based model FORA has a caching level of \textbf{75}\%, \textbf{50}\%, and \textbf{25}\%, and the training-based model Learning-to-cache has a caching level of \textbf{22}\%. Specifically, the FID values change from 30.454 to 21.690 (\textbf{28.8}\%), from 6.857 to 5.821 (\textbf{15.1}\%), from 3.870 to 3.692 (\textbf{4.6}\%), and from 3.539 to 3.451 (\textbf{2.5}\%) respectively.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Gradient-Optimized Cache
**Authors**: Junxiang Qiu, Lin Liu, Shuo Wang, Jinda Lu, Kezhou Chen, Yanbin Hao

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T01:36:03Z

**Summary**: Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements. Code is available at https://github.com/qiujx0520/GOC_ICCV2025.git.

**Summary**: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.   A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

### PINT: Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models with Applications to   Long-term Inference on WeatherBench 2m-Temperature Data
**Authors**: Keonvin Park, Jisu Kim, Jaemin Seo

**Updated**: 2025-07-17T13:44:39Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.   Our models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/KV-Park.

### Integrating nano- and micrometer-scale energy deposition models for   mechanistic prediction of radiation-induced DNA damage and cell survival
**Authors**: Giulio Bordieri, Marta Missiaggia, Gianluca Lattanzi, Carmen Villagrasa, Yann Perrot, Francesco G. Cordoni

**Updated**: 2025-07-17T09:55:43Z

**Summary**: We present an integrated modeling framework that combines the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (GSM2), used to predict cell survival fractions, with MINAS-TIRITH, a fast and efficient Geant4 DNA-based tool for simulating radiation-induced DNA damage in cell populations. This approach enables the generation of spatially and structurally resolved double-strand break (DSB) distributions, capturing key features such as damage complexity and chromosome specificity. A novel application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced to group DSBs at the micrometer scale. This allows the identification of physical aggregates of DNA damage and their association with subnuclear domains, providing a direct link to the cell survival probability as predicted by \gsm.   The model was validated using experimental data from HUVEC cells irradiated with 220 kV X-rays and H460 cells exposed to protons over a wide linear energy transfer (LET) range, from approximately 4 keV/{\mu}m to over 20 keV/{\mu}m. Results show excellent agreement between simulations and experimental survival probabilities, making this one of the first consistent multi-scale models to bridge nanodosimetric and microdosimetric representations of radiation with biological outcomes such as cell survival.   By incorporating the inherent stochastic nature of radiation-matter interactions, this framework effectively connects the physical properties of the radiation field to the biological response at the cellular level. Its accuracy across various radiation types and energies supports its potential for use in biologically optimized radiotherapy.

### IAM: Efficient Inference through Attention Mapping between   Different-scale LLMs
**Authors**: Yi Zhao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-07-16T06:39:11Z

**Summary**: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays, especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

### Streaming 4D Visual Geometry Transformer
**Authors**: Dong Zhuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Jiahe Guo, Yuqi Wu, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T17:59:57Z

**Summary**: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems. Code is available at: https://github.com/wzzheng/StreamVGGT.

### MIRAGE: KV Cache Optimization through Parameter Remapping for   Multi-tenant LLM Serving
**Authors**: Ruihao Li, Shagnik Pal, Vineeth Narayan Pullu, Prasoon Sinha, Jeeho Ryoo, Lizy K. John, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T17:23:22Z

**Summary**: KV cache accelerates LLM inference by avoiding redundant computation, at the expense of memory. To support larger KV caches, prior work extends GPU memory with CPU memory via CPU-offloading. This involves swapping KV cache between GPU and CPU memory. However, because the cache updates dynamically, such swapping incurs high CPU memory traffic. We make a key observation that model parameters remain constant during runtime, unlike the dynamically updated KV cache. Building on this, we introduce MIRAGE, which avoids KV cache swapping by remapping, and thereby repurposing, the memory allocated to model parameters for KV cache. This parameter remapping is especially beneficial in multi-tenant environments, where the memory used for the parameters of the inactive models can be more aggressively reclaimed. Exploiting the high CPU-GPU bandwidth offered by the modern hardware, such as the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, we show that MIRAGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving a reduction of 44.8%-82.5% in tail time-between-token latency, 20.7%-99.3% in tail time-to-first-token latency, and 6.6%-86.7% higher throughput compared to vLLM.

### ContextCache: Context-Aware Semantic Cache for Multi-Turn Queries in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jianxin Yan, Wangze Ni, Lei Chen, Xuemin Lin, Peng Cheng, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T12:59:47Z

**Summary**: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses. However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries, lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings. This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally, cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM conversational applications.

### KV-Latent: Dimensional-level KV Cache Reduction with Frequency-aware   Rotary Positional Embedding
**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Guoming Liu, Baoyuan Qi, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T12:52:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value (KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck, both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes. Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism, avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShiLuohe/KV-Latent.

**Authors**: Xiaoyao Zhong, Haotian Li, Jiabao Jin, Mingyu Yang, Deming Chu, Xiangyu Wang, Zhitao Shen, Wei Jia, George Gu, Yi Xie, Xuemin Lin, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song, Peng Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T11:31:14Z

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index. This paper introduces VSAG, an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory access: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii) efficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.

### Two-dimensional single-crystal photonic scintillator for enhanced X-ray   imaging
**Authors**: Tatsunori Shibuya, Eichi Terasawa, Hiromi Kimura, Takeshi Fujiwara

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T09:15:18Z

**Summary**: The evolution of X-ray detection technology has significantly enhanced sensitivity and spatial resolution in non-destructive imaging of internal structure. However, the problem of low luminescence and transparency of scintillator materials restricts imaging with lower radiation doses and thicker materials. Here, we propose a two-dimensional photonic scintillator for single crystal and demonstrate that the optical guiding effect emerging from the structure reduces luminescence leakage and increases the signal intensity by around a factor of 2 from 200 to 450 kV. This approach has the potential to enhance the output rate by an order of magnitude. The photonic structure features a fine array pitch and large-scale detection area with fast fabrication time. Our scheme paves the way for high sensitivity X-ray imaging.

**Authors**: Yinuo Wang, Tianqi Mao, Lin Gan, Wubing Wan, Zeyu Song, Jiayu Fu, Lanke He, Wenqiang Wang, Zekun Yin, Wei Xue, Guangwen Yang

**Updated**: 2025-07-15T08:00:11Z

**Summary**: Matrix-accelerated stencil computation is a hot research topic, yet its application to three-dimensional (3D) high-order stencils and HPC remains underexplored. With the emergence of matrix units on multicore CPUs, we analyze matrix-based acceleration strategies and tailor an optimal approach for 3D high-order stencils. We introduce algorithmic optimizations based on SIMD and matrix units to address strided memory accesses, alignment conflicts, and redundant accesses. We propose memory optimizations to boost on-package memory efficiency, and a novel multi-thread parallelism paradigm to overcome data-sharing challenges caused by the absence of shared data caches. MMStencil sustains consistently high hardware utilization across diverse stencil shapes and dimensions.

**Authors**: Aaron Jarmusch, Nathan Graddon, Sunita Chandrasekaran

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T20:38:09Z

**Summary**: The rapid development in scientific research provides a need for more compute power, which is partly being solved by GPUs. This paper presents a microarchitectural analysis of the modern NVIDIA Blackwell architecture by studying GPU performance   features with thought through microbenchmarks. We unveil key subsystems, including the memory hierarchy, SM execution   pipelines, and the SM sub-core units, including the 5th generation tensor cores supporting FP4 and FP6 precisions.   To understand the different key features of the NVIDIA GPU, we study latency, throughput, cache behavior, and scheduling   details, revealing subtle tuning metrics in the design of Blackwell. To develop a comprehensive analysis, we compare the   Blackwell architecture with the previous Hopper architecture by using the GeForce RTX 5080 and H100 PCIe, respectively. We   evaluate and compare results, presenting both generational improvements and performance regressions. Additionally, we   investigate the role of power efficiency and energy consumption under varied workloads. Our findings provide actionable insights   for application developers, compiler writers, and performance engineers to optimize workloads on Blackwell-based platforms,   and contribute new data to the growing research on GPU architectures.

### Enabling the Write-Back Page Cache with Strong Consistency in   Distributed Userspace File Systems
**Authors**: Haoyu Li, Jingkai Fu, Qing Li, Windsor Hsu, Asaf Cidon

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T19:51:09Z

**Summary**: Cloud platforms host thousands of tenants that demand POSIX semantics, high throughput, and rapid evolution from their storage layer. Kernel-native distributed file systems supply raw speed, but their privileged code base couples every release to the kernel, widens the blast radius of crashes, and slows innovation. FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs: they run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the FUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong consistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak consistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow write-through I/O, an limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems out of write-intensive cloud workloads.   To this end, We present DistFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that delivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DistFUSE achieves this by offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing coordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design eliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong consistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DistFUSE achieves up to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the existing write-through design of FUSE-based distributed file system.

### FAFO: Over 1 million TPS on a single node running EVM while still   Merkleizing every block
**Authors**: Ryan Zarick, Isaac Zhang, Daniel Wong, Thomas Kim, Bryan Pellegrino, Mignon Li, Kelvin Wong

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T19:31:06Z

**Summary**: Current blockchain execution throughput is limited by data contention, reducing execution layer parallelism. Fast Ahead-of-Formation Optimization (FAFO) is the first blockchain transaction scheduler to address this problem by reordering transactions before block formation for maximum concurrency. FAFO uses CPU-optimized cache-friendly Bloom filters to efficiently detect conflicts and schedule parallel transaction execution at high throughput and low overhead.   We integrate the Rust EVM client (REVM) into FAFO and achieve over 1.1 million native ETH transfers per second and over half a million ERC20 transfers per second on a single node (Table 1), with 91% lower cost compared to state-of-the-art sharded execution. Unlike many other existing high throughput blockchain execution clients, FAFO uses QMDB to Merkleize world state after every block, enabling light clients and stateless validation for ZK-based vApps. FAFO scales with minimal synchronization overhead, scaling linearly with additional CPU resources until it fully exploits the maximum parallelism of the underlying transaction flow. FAFO proves that the high throughput necessary to support future decentralized applications can be achieved with a streamlined execution layer and innovations in blockchain transaction scheduler design. FAFO is open-sourced at https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/fafo.

### DroidSpeak: KV Cache Sharing for Cross-LLM Communication and Multi-LLM   Serving
**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Yuyang Huang, Jiayi Yao, Shaoting Feng, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Hanchen Li, Yihua Cheng, Junchen Jiang, Shan Lu, Madan Musuvathi, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T18:22:53Z

**Summary**: Compound AI systems, such as agentic systems, are an emerging trend in large-scale enterprise settings, with multiple LLMs specialized for different users, tasks, and/or roles working together. In these scenarios, different models often process inputs that share the same context prefix. Although much work was done in the past to enable the reuse of prefix KV caches across inputs for a single model, how to enable one model to reuse the prefix KV caches of a different model remains an open question.   We introduce DroidSpeak, the first distributed LLM inference system that enables KV cache reuse across distributed nodes running inference of different LLMs, so long as the LLMs have the same architecture. We present the first study that aims at understanding the impact of sharing KV caches across different LLMs, and if/when such sharing affects quality. Inspired by the findings, we present DroidSpeak, which selectively recomputes a few layers of the KV cache produced by another LLM and reuses the remaining layers, with negligible quality loss. Moreover, carefully pipelining the layer-wise re-computation and the loading of reused KV cache further improves the inference performance. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 4x throughput improvement and about 3.1x faster prefill (time to first token), with negligible loss of quality in F1 scores, Rouge-L or code similarity score, compared to the baseline which does not allow any sharing across models.

### Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive   Token-Level Computation
**Authors**: Sangmin Bae, Yujin Kim, Reza Bayat, Sungnyun Kim, Jiyoun Ha, Tal Schuster, Adam Fisch, Hrayr Harutyunyan, Ziwei Ji, Aaron Courville, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T17:49:00Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

### PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following   Models Need for Efficient Generation
**Authors**: Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jiaxin Li, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T16:14:49Z

**Summary**: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV.

### FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Junbin Kang, Mingkai Dong, Mingyu Liu, Lu Zhang, Shaohong Guo, Ziyan Qiu, Mingzhen You, Ziyi Tian, Anqi Yu, Tianhong Ding, Xinwei Hu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T15:09:01Z

**Summary**: Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year.

### Pruning the Tree: Rethinking RPKI Architecture From The Ground Up
**Authors**: Haya Schulmann, Niklas Vogel

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T09:45:34Z

**Summary**: Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism for BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its adoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such as X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols, which introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and inefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design choices, although based on established standards, create significant performance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder scalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.   In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of complexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world impact. We show that over 70\% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is spent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it unnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI), a backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while substantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and ROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose encodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more efficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of iRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time, 18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory footprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to at least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the feasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in constrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without impacting existing operations.

### ElasticMM: Efficient Multimodal LLMs Serving with Elastic Multimodal   Parallelism
**Authors**: Zedong Liu, Shenggan Cheng, Guangming Tan, Yang You, Dingwen Tao

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T08:53:48Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we propose Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

### Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks   for AI generated text detection
**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T07:05:28Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

**Summary**: We present a thorough analysis of the use of modern heterogeneous systems interconnected by various cachecoherent links, including CXL, NVLink-C2C, and Infinity Fabric. We studied a wide range of server systems that combined CPUs from different vendors and various types of coherent memory devices, including CXL memory expander, CXL pool, CXL shared memory, GH200 GPU, and AMD MI300a HBM. For this study, we developed a heterogeneous memory benchmark suite, Heimdall, to profile the performance of such heterogeneous systems and present a detailed performance comparison across systems. By leveraging H E I M DA L L , we unveiled the detailed architecture design in these systems, drew observations on optimizing performance for workloads, and pointed out directions for future development of cache coherent heterogeneous systems.

### InstCache: A Predictive Cache for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Longwei Zou, Yan Liu, Jiamu Kang, Tingfeng Liu, Jiangang Kong, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-07-14T02:22:43Z

**Summary**: The revolutionary capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting rapidly growing popularity and leading to soaring user requests to inference serving systems. Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce computation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference engines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the token level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request volume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full instruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role. However, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it rare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting challenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this challenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving systems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the representation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of spatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential instructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an effective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that InstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of traditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per output token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets, respectively.

### Advancing Reliable Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models under   Visual Variations
**Authors**: Yiwen Liang, Hui Chen, Yizhe Xiong, Zihan Zhou, Mengyao Lyu, Zijia Lin, Shuaicheng Niu, Sicheng Zhao, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-07-13T05:37:33Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

### Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs
**Authors**: Chenchen Gu, Xiang Lisa Li, Rohith Kuditipudi, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2025-07-13T04:42:28Z

**Summary**: Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

### Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Xianglong Liu, Jing Liu, Yuhang Li, Jiwen Lu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T22:14:01Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.

### Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chien Van Nguyen, Ruiyi Zhang, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Puneet Mathur, Viet Dac Lai, Haoliang Wang, Jayakumar Subramanian, Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui, Nikos Vlassis, Franck Dernoncourt, Thien Huu Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-07-20T03:49:03Z

**Summary**: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

### HotSwap: Enabling Live Dependency Sharing in Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Rui Li, Devesh Tiwari, Gene Cooperman

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T19:57:51Z

**Summary**: This work presents HotSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous research has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific functions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production workloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential. Without cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally poor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each function in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies function-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function in the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap demonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In this strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new function instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be shared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, HotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that HotSwap can save 88\% of space, compared with a previous function-specific method, PreBaking, when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.

### KV Cache Steering for Inducing Reasoning in Small Language Models
**Authors**: Max Belitsky, Dawid J. Kopiczko, Michael Dorkenwald, M. Jehanzeb Mirza, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T17:59:36Z

**Summary**: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

**Summary**: Previous generations of cellular communication, such as 5G, have been designed with the objective of improving key performance indicators (KPIs) such as throughput, latency, etc. However, to meet the evolving KPI demands as well as the ambitious sustainability targets for the ICT industry, 6G will need to be designed differently. Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the performance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve. Moreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate technological enablers, making the design space of the system even more complex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability indicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in literature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to them. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system design based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its input: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key Values (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers to satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in Hexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies between the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for determining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been introduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its application in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use case defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected. Lastly, results from proof-of-concept demonstrations for a subset of the selected enablers have also been provided, which reinforce the efficacy of the KG method for designing a sustainable 6G system.

### Reciprocating Locks
**Authors**: Dave Dice, Alex Kogan

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T14:27:25Z

**Summary**: We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

### BayesTTA: Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language   Models via Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
**Authors**: Shuang Cui, Jinglin Xu, Yi Li, Xiongxin Tang, Jiangmeng Li, Jiahuan Zhou, Fanjiang Xu, Fuchun Sun, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T14:02:54Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting; entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data, adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment. We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets. Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining efficiency. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/cuishuang99/BayesTTA}{https://github.com/cuishuang99/BayesTTA}.

### InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via   ICL-oriented Prefix Caching
**Authors**: Yilun Wang, Pengfei Chen, Haiyu Huang, Zilong He, Gou Tan, Chuanfu Zhang, Jingkai He, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T12:21:29Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.   In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.

**Authors**: Ekaterina Kochmar, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Kseniia Petukhova, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Anaïs Tack, Justin Vasselli

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T10:57:36Z

**Summary**: This shared task has aimed to assess pedagogical abilities of AI tutors powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on evaluating the quality of tutor responses aimed at student's mistake remediation within educational dialogues. The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate the AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification, precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34 (for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching 96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the shared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their performance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly available to support future research in this critical domain.

### xpSHACL: Explainable SHACL Validation using Retrieval-Augmented   Generation and Large Language Models
**Authors**: Gustavo Correa Publio, José Emilio Labra Gayo

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T09:18:41Z

**Summary**: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and consistency.

### Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated   Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Wongi Jeong, Kyungryeol Lee, Hoigi Seo, Se Young Chun

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T09:07:43Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.

### Observation of the electric Breit-Rabi Effect
**Authors**: S. -Z. Wang, S. -B. Wang, Z. -J. Tao, T. Xia, Z. -T. Lu

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T02:57:44Z

**Summary**: The response of an atom to external electric and magnetic fields can reveal fundamental atomic properties. It has long been verified that, in a static magnetic field, those atomic energy levels with hyperfine interactions shift according to the Breit-Rabi formula, which introduces nonlinear dependence on the magnetic field. On the other hand, the corresponding Breit-Rabi dependence on a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of experimental challenges. Here we precisely measure the Stark shift of the $6s^2\ ^1S_0\ \leftrightarrow\ 6s6p\ ^1P_1$ transition of $^{171}$Yb ($I$ = 1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field up to 120 kV/cm. We observe the electric Breit-Rabi effect displaying high-order ($E^4$ and $E^6$) DC Stark shifts. These effects arise from the influence of the strong electric field on hyperfine interactions.

### Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Real Students' Abilities in Mathematics and   Reading Comprehension?
**Authors**: KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-07-11T00:36:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model- and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable proxies based on our findings.

### Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with   Approximate Leverage Scores
**Authors**: Vivek Chari, Benjamin Van Durme

**Updated**: 2025-07-10T20:03:35Z

**Summary**: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache, which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked (query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families.

### Multi-Granular Spatio-Temporal Token Merging for Training-Free   Acceleration of Video LLMs
**Authors**: Jeongseok Hyun, Sukjun Hwang, Su Ho Han, Taeoh Kim, Inwoong Lee, Dongyoon Wee, Joon-Young Lee, Seon Joo Kim, Minho Shim

**Updated**: 2025-07-10T17:59:02Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

### Scaling RL to Long Videos
**Authors**: Yukang Chen, Wei Huang, Baifeng Shi, Qinghao Hu, Hanrong Ye, Ligeng Zhu, Zhijian Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Xiaojuan Qi, Sifei Liu, Hongxu Yin, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-07-10T17:47:40Z

**Summary**: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

### Parallel CPU-GPU Execution for LLM Inference on Constrained GPUs
**Authors**: Jiakun Fan, Yanglin Zhang, Xiangchen Li, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-07-10T17:10:49Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments.   We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings. APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference efficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for scheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient real-time LLM applications.

### KVFlow: Efficient Prefix Caching for Accelerating LLM-Based Multi-Agent   Workflows
**Authors**: Zaifeng Pan, Ajjkumar Patel, Zhengding Hu, Yipeng Shen, Yue Guan, Wan-Lu Li, Lianhui Qin, Yida Wang, Yufei Ding

**Updated**: 2025-07-10T03:39:23Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) based agentic workflows have become a popular paradigm for coordinating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks. To improve serving efficiency, existing LLM systems employ prefix caching to reuse key-value (KV) tensors corresponding to agents' fixed prompts, thereby avoiding redundant computation across repeated invocations. However, current systems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy, which fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches shortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial recomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV cache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the agent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a steps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future activation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node level, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently manage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a fully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required tensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next step, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation. Compared to SGLang with hierarchical radix cache, KVFlow achieves up to 1.83$\times$ speedup for single workflows with large prompts, and up to 2.19$\times$ speedup for scenarios with many concurrent workflows.

### Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with   Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing
**Authors**: Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-07-10T01:51:17Z

**Summary**: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.   We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

### Stabilization of the first-order phase transition character and   Enhancement of the Electrocaloric Effect by NBT substitution in BaTiO$_3$   ceramics
**Authors**: M. Karakaya, I. Gurbuz, L. Fulanovic, U. Adem

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T21:18:35Z

**Summary**: The electrocaloric properties of BaTiO$_3$-based lead-free ferroelectric materials have been widely investigated. One approach to achieving a large electrocaloric response is to exploit the substantial polarization change associated with the first-order phase transition at the Curie temperature. Following this strategy, we investigated the electrocaloric response of (1$-x$)BaTiO$_3$-$x$Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ (BT-NBT) ceramics for x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. In this BT-rich region of the solid solution, it is established that increasing the NBT content enhances the tetragonality of BaTiO$_3$. We show that this increase in tetragonality helps maintain the first-order nature of the phase transition and enables a correspondingly large electrocaloric response, despite the simultaneous enhancement of relaxor ferroelectric character with NBT substitution. A significantly large effective electrocaloric temperature change ($\Delta T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) of ~1.65 K was obtained for the x = 0.20 composition under an applied field of 40 kV/cm using direct electrocaloric measurements, in reasonable agreement with the indirect results.

### PromptTea: Let Prompts Tell TeaCache the Optimal Threshold
**Authors**: Zishen Huang, Chunyu Yang, Mengyuan Ren

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T10:53:05Z

**Summary**: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.

### Saffron-1: Safety Inference Scaling
**Authors**: Ruizhong Qiu, Gaotang Li, Tianxin Wei, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T07:47:59Z

**Summary**: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

### SlimCaching: Edge Caching of Mixture-of-Experts for Distributed   Inference
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T05:43:43Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input. However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy, we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee. For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective. To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference latency compared to existing baselines.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T04:43:59Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### SpindleKV: A Novel KV Cache Reduction Method Balancing Both Shallow and   Deep Layers
**Authors**: Zicong Tang, Shi Luohe, Zuchao Li, Baoyuan Qi, Guoming Liu, Lefei Zhang, Ping Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T03:33:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV, which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar or even better model performance.

### TokenSwift: Lossless Acceleration of Ultra Long Sequence Generation
**Authors**: Tong Wu, Junzhe Shen, Zixia Jia, Yuxuan Wang, Zilong Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-07-09T02:35:21Z

**Summary**: Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths. Code can be found at https://github.com/bigai-nlco/TokenSwift.

### Optomechanical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing
**Authors**: Margaret Pavlovich, Peter Rakich, Shruti Puri

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T21:23:30Z

**Summary**: Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.

### Multi-Queue SSD I/O Modeling & Its Implications for Data Structure   Design
**Authors**: Erin Ransom, Andrew Lim, Michael Mitzenmacher

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T19:20:30Z

**Summary**: Understanding the performance profiles of storage devices and how best to utilize them has always been non-trivial due to factors such as seek times, caching, scheduling, concurrent access, flash wear-out, and garbage collection. However, analytical frameworks that provide simplified abstractions of storage performance can still be accurate enough to evaluate external memory algorithms and data structures at the design stage. For example, the Disk Access Machine (DAM) model assumes that a storage device transfers data in fixed-size blocks of size B and that all transfers have unit latency. This abstraction is already sufficient to explain some of the benefits of data structures such as B-trees and Log-Structured Merge trees (LSM trees); however, storage technology advances have significantly reduced current models' accuracy and utility.   This paper introduces the Multi-Queue Solid State Drive (MQSSD) model, a new storage abstraction. This model builds upon previous models and aims to more accurately represent the performance characteristics of modern storage hardware. We identify key performance-critical aspects of modern multi-queue solid-state drives on which we base our model and demonstrate these characteristics on actual hardware. We then show how our model can be applied to LSM-tree-based storage engines to optimize them for modern storage hardware. We highlight that leveraging concurrent access is crucial for fully utilizing the high throughput of multi-queue SSDs, enabling designs that may appear counterintuitive under traditional paradigms We then validate these insights through experiments using Facebook's LSM-tree-based key-value store, RocksDB. We conclude that the MQSSD model offers a more accurate abstraction of modern hardware than previous models, allowing for greater insight and optimization.

### FastVAR: Linear Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Cached Token Pruning
**Authors**: Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Taolin Zhang, Jiangshan Wang, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T12:34:10Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.

### An Ensemble Embedding Approach for Improving Semantic Caching   Performance in LLM-based Systems
**Authors**: Shervin Ghaffari, Zohre Bahranifard, Mohammad Akbari

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T09:20:12Z

**Summary**: Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM) systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once, and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation, which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems. We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in LLM-based systems.

### Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through   Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Xiaoye Qu, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T07:10:06Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers. Codes are provided in the https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.

### Torpor: GPU-Enabled Serverless Computing for Low-Latency,   Resource-Efficient Inference
**Authors**: Minchen Yu, Ao Wang, Dong Chen, Haoxuan Yu, Xiaonan Luo, Zhuohao Li, Wei Wang, Ruichuan Chen, Dapeng Nie, Haoran Yang, Yu Ding

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T02:15:07Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing offers a compelling cloud model for online inference services. However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for GPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this paper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency inference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous inference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically swaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model swapping). Torpor uses various techniques, including asynchronous API redirection, GPU runtime sharing, pipelined model execution, and efficient GPU memory management, to minimize latency overhead caused by model swapping. Additionally, we design an interference-aware request scheduling algorithm that utilizes high-speed GPU interconnects to meet latency service-level objectives (SLOs) for individual inference functions. We have implemented Torpor and evaluated its performance in a production environment. Utilizing late binding and model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference functions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance comparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a GPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that Torpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the platform, respectively.

### RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders
**Authors**: Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-08T00:51:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

### Helix Parallelism: Rethinking Sharding Strategies for Interactive   Multi-Million-Token LLM Decoding
**Authors**: Nidhi Bhatia, Ankit More, Ritika Borkar, Tiyasa Mitra, Ramon Matas, Ritchie Zhao, Maximilian Golub, Dheevatsa Mudigere, Brian Pharris, Bita Darvish Rouhani

**Updated**: 2025-07-07T19:47:24Z

**Summary**: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN) weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention. When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously, DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further capping efficiency.   We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

**Authors**: Meng Wei, Chenyang Wan, Xiqian Yu, Tai Wang, Yuqiang Yang, Xiaohan Mao, Chenming Zhu, Wenzhe Cai, Hanqing Wang, Yilun Chen, Xihui Liu, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-07-07T17:49:41Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding, long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision, language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues, while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse, supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost. Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

### The Case for Instance-Optimized LLMs in OLAP Databases
**Authors**: Bardia Mohammadi, Laurent Bindschaedler

**Updated**: 2025-07-07T13:10:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance analytics systems with powerful data summarization, cleaning, and semantic transformation capabilities. However, deploying LLMs at scale -- processing millions to billions of rows -- remains prohibitively expensive in computation and memory. We present IOLM-DB, a novel system that makes LLM-enhanced database queries practical through query-specific model optimization. Instead of using general-purpose LLMs, IOLM-DB generates lightweight, specialized models tailored to each query's specific needs using representative data samples. IOLM-DB reduces model footprints by up to 76% and increases throughput by up to 3.31$\times$ while maintaining accuracy through aggressive compression techniques, including quantization, sparsification, and structural pruning. We further show how our approach enables higher parallelism on existing hardware and seamlessly supports caching and batching strategies to reduce overheads. Our prototype demonstrates that leveraging LLM queries inside analytics systems is feasible at scale, opening new possibilities for future OLAP applications.

### A fast MPI-based Distributed Hash-Table as Surrogate Model demonstrated   in a coupled reactive transport HPC simulation
**Authors**: Max Lübke, Marco De Lucia, Stefan Petri, Bettina Schnor

**Updated**: 2025-07-07T09:25:21Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

### Performance Evaluation of General Purpose Large Language Models for   Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms Code Generation
**Authors**: Daichi Mukunoki, Shun-ichiro Hayashi, Tetsuya Hoshino, Takahiro Katagiri

**Updated**: 2025-07-07T06:33:59Z

**Summary**: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate (1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that the code is faster than the reference code.

### RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy in Language Modeling
**Authors**: Xiuying Wei, Anunay Yadav, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-07-06T15:08:49Z

**Summary**: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work, rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs) and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks, applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase in a summarization SFT task.

### A LoD of Gaussians: Unified Training and Rendering for Ultra-Large Scale   Reconstruction with External Memory
**Authors**: Felix Windisch, Lukas Radl, Thomas Köhler, Michael Steiner, Dieter Schmalstieg, Markus Steinberger

**Updated**: 2025-07-05T15:51:57Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

### SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs
**Authors**: Jiahui Wang, Zuyan Liu, Yongming Rao, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-07-05T15:40:51Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test.

### Heterogeneous Memory Benchmarking Toolkit
**Authors**: Golsana Ghaemi, Gabriel Franco, Kazem Taram, Renato Mancuso

**Updated**: 2025-07-05T13:37:48Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an open-source kernel-level heterogeneous memory characterization framework (MemScope) for embedded systems. MemScope enables precise characterization of the temporal behavior of available memory modules under configurable contention stress scenarios. MemScope leverages kernel-level control over physical memory allocation, cache maintenance, CPU state, interrupts, and I/O device activity to accurately benchmark heterogeneous memory subsystems. This gives us the privilege to directly map pieces of contiguous physical memory and instantiate allocators, allowing us to finely control cores to create and eliminate interference. Additionally, we can minimize noise and interruptions, guaranteeing more consistent and precise results compared to equivalent user-space solutions. Running our Framework on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 CPU-FPGA platform demonstrates its capability to precisely benchmark bandwidth and latency across various memory types, including PL-side DRAM and BRAM, in a multi-core system.

**Summary**: We introduce an efficient and elegant combination generator for producing all combinations of size less than or equal to K, designed for exhaustive generation and combinatorial optimization tasks. This generator can be implemented to achieve what we define as optimal efficiency: constant amortized time, optimal cache utilization, embarrassingly parallel execution, and a recursive structure compatible with pruning-based search. These properties are difficult to satisfy simultaneously in existing generators. For example, classical Gray code or lexicographic generators are typically list-based and sequentially defined, making them difficult to vectorized, inefficient in cache usage, and inherently hard to parallelize. Generators based on unranking methods, while easy to parallelize, are non-recursive. These limitations reduce their applicability in our target applications, where both computational efficiency and recursion are crucial. We adapt Bird's algebra of programming-style calculation to derive our algorithms, a formalism for developing correct-by-construction programs from specifications. As a result, all generators in this paper are first formulated in their clearest specification, and efficient definitions are derived constructively through equational reasoning, resulting in concise and elegant divide-and-conquer definitions. Beyond presenting a combination generator, we extend our approach to construct generators for K-permutations, nested combinations of combinations, and nested permutation-combination structures. To the best of our knowledge, the literature has not previously reported generators for these nested structures. We also develop sequential variants that produce configurations in Gray code-compatible orders -- such as the revolving door ordering -- which are particularly useful for constructing nested generators.

### PFCS: Prime Factorization Cache System for Deterministic Data   Relationship Discovery
**Authors**: Duy Le

**Updated**: 2025-07-05T06:55:45Z

**Summary**: Cache systems fundamentally limit modern computing performance due to their inability to precisely capture data relationships. While achieving 85-92% hit rates, traditional systems rely on statistical heuristics that cannot guarantee relationship discovery, leading to suboptimal prefetching and resource waste. We present PFCS (Prime Factorization Cache System), which leverages the mathematical uniqueness of prime factorization to achieve deterministic relationship discovery with zero false positives. PFCS assigns unique primes to data elements and represents relationships as composite numbers, enabling the recovery of perfect relationships through factorization. A comprehensive evaluation across database, ML, and HPC workloads demonstrates an average performance improvement of x 6.2, 98.9% hit rates, and a 38% power reduction compared to state-of-the-art systems. The mathematical foundation provides formal guarantees impossible with approximation-based approaches, establishing a new paradigm for cache system design

**Updated**: 2025-07-05T01:08:40Z

**Summary**: The battle for a more secure Internet is waged on many fronts, including the most basic of networking protocols. Our focus is the IPv4 Identifier (IPID), an IPv4 header field as old as the Internet with an equally long history as an exploited side channel for scanning network properties, inferring off-path connections, and poisoning DNS caches. This article taxonomizes the 25-year history of IPID-based exploits and the corresponding changes to IPID selection methods. By mathematically analyzing these methods' correctness and security and empirically evaluating their performance, we reveal recommendations for best practice as well as shortcomings of current operating system implementations, emphasizing the value of systematic evaluations in network security.

### Memory- and compute-optimized geometric multigrid GMGPolar for   curvilinear coordinate representations -- Applications to fusion plasma
**Authors**: Julian Litz, Philippe Leleux, Carola Kruse, Joscha Gedicke, Martin J. Kühn

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T21:09:51Z

**Summary**: Tokamak fusion reactors are actively studied as a means of realizing energy production from plasma fusion. However, due to the substantial cost and time required to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical experiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks, supporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor designs. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that arise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been shown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson equation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared to other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely refactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different matrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the Sherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line solvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache access of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach, memory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are obtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can be attained.

### Quantum Algorithm for the Fixed-Radius Neighbor Search
**Authors**: Luca Cappelli, Claudio Sanavio, Alessandro Andrea Zecchi, Giuseppe Murante, Sauro Succi

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T10:01:10Z

**Summary**: The neighbor search is a computationally demanding problem, usually both time- and memory-consuming. The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the long execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We derive an efficient circuit for solving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles $N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within the fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by cache miss. We explicitly write the Grover's operator and analyze its gate complexity. The whole algorithm has complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^{\frac{1}{2}}N^{2})$ in the worst-case scenario, where $M$ is the number of neighboring pairs, and uses $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ number of qubits. By employing extra ancilla qubits the depth of the circuit can be brought down to $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ at the cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits for unstructured dataset, or $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log N))$ qubits for structured datasets. Finally we assess the resilience of the model to the readout error, suggesting an error correction-free strategy to check the accuracy of the results.

### Low-Light Enhancement via Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination   Guidance
**Authors**: Le-Anh Tran, Chung Nguyen Tran, Ngoc-Luu Nguyen, Nhan Cach Dang, Jordi Carrabina, David Castells-Rufas, Minh Son Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T09:35:00Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance (EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions, effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE), and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is available at https://github.com/tranleanh/ednig.

### Numerical investigation of the effect of high voltage frequency on the   density of RONS species in the air atmospheric pressure gas discharge
**Authors**: Fariborz Momtazzadeh, Farshad Sohbatzadeh, Hamed Soltani Ahmadi, Ramin Mehrabifard

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T09:03:18Z

**Summary**: In the last few decades, studies in various fields of plasma technology have expanded and its application in different processes has increased. Therefore, the achievement of a desirable and practical plasma with specific characteristics is of particular importance. The frequency of the applied voltage is one of the important factors that play a role in the physical and chemical characteristics. In this research, changes in the density of active species produced in an electrical discharge using a dielectric barrier and air working gas have been investigated from a frequency of 500 Hz to 500 kHz, and by applying a constant voltage of 2 kV, have been investigated. For this purpose, 87 different reactions with specific collision cross-sections were defined in COMSOL Multiphysics. Other parameters, including current-voltage waveform, electric field, and species densitywere evaluated. The results show that under completely identical conditions, the electron temperature distribution changes with increasing applied frequency, and the density of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species RONS decreases, but O shows an increasing trend. It should be noted that the simulation results are in good agreement with previous experimental and simulation reports. These results offer valuable insights into optimizing plasma parameters for different applications, potentially resulting in better treatment outcomes across a range of therapeutic domains.

### CAOTE: KV Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention Output Error-Based Token   Selection
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T06:49:31Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T06:36:38Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS, a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention, FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method, Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

### Robust and Efficient Embedded Convex Optimization through First-Order   Adaptive Caching
**Authors**: Ishaan Mahajan, Brian Plancher

**Updated**: 2025-07-04T00:16:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks, achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2) complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.

### HGCA: Hybrid GPU-CPU Attention for Long Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Weishu Deng, Yujie Yang, Peiran Du, Lingfeng Xiang, Zhen Lin, Chen Zhong, Song Jiang, Hui Lu, Jia Rao

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T20:20:33Z

**Summary**: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV) caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable, high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on commodity GPU hardware.

### Less is Enough: Training-Free Video Diffusion Acceleration via   Runtime-Adaptive Caching
**Authors**: Xin Zhou, Dingkang Liang, Kaijin Chen, Tianrui Feng, Xiwu Chen, Hongkai Lin, Yikang Ding, Feiyang Tan, Hengshuang Zhao, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T17:59:54Z

**Summary**: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/EasyCache.

### HybridTier: an Adaptive and Lightweight CXL-Memory Tiering System
**Authors**: Kevin Song, Jiacheng Yang, Zixuan Wang, Jishen Zhao, Sihang Liu, Gennady Pekhimenko

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T17:11:28Z

**Summary**: Modern workloads are demanding increasingly larger memory capacity. Compute Express Link (CXL)-based memory tiering has emerged as a promising solution for addressing this problem by utilizing traditional DRAM alongside slow-tier CXL memory devices. We analyze prior tiering systems and observe two challenges for high-performance memory tiering: adapting to skewed but dynamically varying data hotness distributions while minimizing memory and cache overhead due to tiering.   To address these challenges, we propose HybridTier, an adaptive and lightweight tiering system for CXL memory. HybridTier tracks both long-term data access frequency and short-term access momentum \emph{simultaneously} to accurately capture and adapt to shifting hotness distributions. HybridTier reduces the metadata memory overhead by tracking data accesses \emph{probabilistically}, obtaining higher memory efficiency by trading off a small amount of tracking inaccuracy that has a negligible impact on application performance. To reduce cache overhead, HybridTier uses lightweight data structures that optimize for data locality to track data hotness. Our evaluations show that HybridTier outperforms prior systems by up to $91\%$ ($19\%$ geomean), incurring $2.0-7.8\times$ less memory overhead and $1.7-3.5\times$ less cache misses.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T16:06:35Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

### OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device   Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan, Zhaocong Yuan, Shaojie Zhuo, Chen Feng, Yicheng Lin, Chenzheng Su, Xiaopeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T14:20:41Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

### Skip-Vision: Efficient and Scalable Acceleration of Vision-Language   Models via Adaptive Token Skipping
**Authors**: Weili Zeng, Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Yichao Yan

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T08:22:27Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.

### Direct Reconstruction of Terahertz-driven Subcycle Electron Emission   Dynamics
**Authors**: Jiakang Mao, Yushan Zeng, Hongyang Li, Liwei Song, Ye Tian, Ruxin Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T07:49:18Z

**Summary**: While field-driven electron emission is theoretically understood down to the subcycle regime, its direct experimental temporal characterization using long-wavelength terahertz (THz) fields remains elusive. Here, by driving a graphite tip with phase-stable quasi-single-cycle THz pulses, we reveal distinct subcycle electron emission dynamics including: (1) At a carrier-envelope phase (CEP) near zero, spectral peaks scale linearly with THz field strength, characteristic of subcycle emission; (2) At the opposite CEP, dominant deceleration fields generate stationary low-energy peaks. Crucially, we develop a pump-probe-free, direct reconstruction method extracting electron pulse profiles solely from measured energy spectra, obtaining durations from 97.3 to 114.3 fs as the field increases (191-290 kV/cm). Phase-resolved simulations further reveal a 71.2% modulation in the cutoff energy and a near-total (99.7%) suppression of the emission current. This work not only validates the Fowler-Nordheim model under THz excitation but also establishes a general framework for the direct temporal characterization of subcycle electron emission, opening pathways for precise electron control in ultrafast electron sources and lightwave nanoelectronics.

### Fast-dLLM: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion LLM by Enabling KV   Cache and Parallel Decoding
**Authors**: Chengyue Wu, Hao Zhang, Shuchen Xue, Zhijian Liu, Shizhe Diao, Ligeng Zhu, Ping Luo, Song Han, Enze Xie

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T04:51:05Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.

**Updated**: 2025-07-03T01:22:57Z

**Summary**: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation: error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity demanded by practical scientific applications.

### Autoregressive Image Generation with Linear Complexity: A Spatial-Aware   Decay Perspective
**Authors**: Yuxin Mao, Zhen Qin, Jinxing Zhou, Hui Deng, Xuyang Shen, Bin Fan, Jing Zhang, Yiran Zhong, Yuchao Dai

**Updated**: 2025-07-02T12:27:06Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.

### Learned-Database Systems Security
**Authors**: Roei Schuster, Jin Peng Zhou, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Paul Grubbs, Nicolas Papernot

**Updated**: 2025-07-02T10:16:58Z

**Summary**: A learned database system uses machine learning (ML) internally to improve performance. We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML attacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting users or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches, potentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared to attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as they cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the difference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of the same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks that the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of potentially-increased attack surface in learned database systems and develop a framework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our framework to a broad set of learned components currently being explored in the database community. To empirically validate the vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against these. We show that the use of ML cause leakage of past queries in a database, enable a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory blowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enable index users to snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own keys. We find that adversarial ML is an universal threat against learned components in database systems, point to open research gaps in our understanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing mitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose learned component is shared between multiple parties.

### EdgeLoRA: An Efficient Multi-Tenant LLM Serving System on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Zheyu Shen, Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang, Yuning Zhang, Guoheng Sun, Wanghao Ye, Ang Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-02T07:47:28Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining. Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings, processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.

### Breaking the Boundaries of Long-Context LLM Inference: Adaptive KV   Management on a Single Commodity GPU
**Authors**: He Sun, Li Li, Mingjun Xiao, Chengzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-02T05:12:29Z

**Summary**: Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks. However, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a PC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory demands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify important tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory. The KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a commodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation overhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the first efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single commodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system employs an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into variable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights across different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission overheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which minimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of each chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the dynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference. Experimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference latency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In scenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup.

### AIRES: Accelerating Out-of-Core GCNs via Algorithm-System Co-Design
**Authors**: Shakya Jayakody, Youpeng Zhao, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-02T00:35:43Z

**Summary**: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.   In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage (GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput. Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing benchmarks.

### PAE MobiLLM: Privacy-Aware and Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning on the Mobile   Device via Additive Side-Tuning
**Authors**: Xingke Yang, Liang Li, Zhiyi Wan, Sicong Li, Hao Wang, Xiaoqi Qi, Jiang Liu, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Xin Fu, Miao Pan

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T22:27:21Z

**Summary**: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

### Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Your Off-the-Shelf Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava, Matthew Gwilliam

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T21:27:40Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

### FlashDP: Private Training Large Language Models with Efficient DP-SGD
**Authors**: Liangyu Wang, Junxiao Wang, Jie Ren, Zihang Xiang, David E. Keyes, Di Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T19:28:37Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern. Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data, yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus, necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods. Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a \textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.

### VEDA: Efficient LLM Generation Through Voting-based KV Cache Eviction   and Dataflow-flexible Accelerator
**Authors**: Zhican Wang, Hongxiang Fan, Haroon Waris, Gang Wang, Zhenyu Li, Jianfei Jiang, Yanan Sun, Guanghui He

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T14:30:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks but pose significant computational and memory challenges for edge deployment due to their intensive resource demands. This work addresses the efficiency of LLM inference by algorithm-hardware-dataflow tri-optimizations. We propose a novel voting-based KV cache eviction algorithm, balancing hardware efficiency and algorithm accuracy by adaptively identifying unimportant kv vectors. From a dataflow perspective, we introduce a flexible-product dataflow and a runtime reconfigurable PE array for matrix-vector multiplication. The proposed approach effectively handles the diverse dimensional requirements and solves the challenges of incrementally varying sequence lengths. Additionally, an element-serial scheduling scheme is proposed for nonlinear operations, such as softmax and layer normalization (layernorm). Results demonstrate a substantial reduction in latency, accompanied by a significant decrease in hardware complexity, from O(N) to O(1). The proposed solution is realized in a custom-designed accelerator, VEDA, which outperforms existing hardware platforms. This research represents a significant advancement in LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating real-time processing, enhancing data privacy, and enabling model customization.

 ### Missing baryons recovered: a measurement of the gas fraction in galaxies   and groups with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and CMB lensing
**Authors**: Boryana Hadzhiyska, Simone Ferraro, Gerrit S. Farren, Noah Sailer, Rongpu Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:59:24Z

**Summary**: We present new constraints on the halo masses and matter density profiles of DESI galaxy groups by cross-correlating samples of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) galaxies with the publicly available CMB lensing convergence map from ACT DR6. This provides an independent, lensing-based calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected samples, finding $\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.18$, 13.03 and 13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration. The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem. We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300 simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius by $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.

### Better Understanding Triple Differences Estimators
**Authors**: Marcelo Ortiz-Villavicencio, Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:52:57Z

**Summary**: Triple Differences (DDD) designs are widely used in empirical work to relax parallel trends assumptions in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) settings. This paper highlights that common DDD implementations -- such as taking the difference between two DiDs or applying three-way fixed effects regressions -- are generally invalid when identification requires conditioning on covariates. In staggered adoption settings, the common DiD practice of pooling all not-yet-treated units as a comparison group can introduce additional bias, even when covariates are not required for identification. These insights challenge conventional empirical strategies and underscore the need for estimators tailored specifically to DDD structures. We develop regression adjustment, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators that remain valid under covariate-adjusted DDD parallel trends. For staggered designs, we demonstrate how to effectively utilize multiple comparison groups to obtain more informative inferences. Simulations and three empirical applications highlight bias reductions and precision gains relative to standard approaches. A companion R package is available.

### A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Raghav Singhal, Zachary Horvitz, Ryan Teehan, Mengye Ren, Zhou Yu, Kathleen McKeown, Rajesh Ranganath

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:52:45Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits. Code is available at https://github.com/zacharyhorvitz/Fk-Diffusion-Steering .

### Harmony in Divergence: Towards Fast, Accurate, and Memory-efficient   Zeroth-order LLM Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Qitao Tan, Jun Liu, Zheng Zhan, Caiwei Ding, Yanzhi Wang, Xiaolong Ma, Jaewoo Lee, Jin Lu, Geng Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:50:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiZO-E86D.

### CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Jiwei Li, Chris Shum

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:43:56Z

**Summary**: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.   CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.   The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

### Automated Interpretation of Non-Destructive Evaluation Contour Maps   Using Large Language Models for Bridge Condition Assessment
**Authors**: Viraj Nishesh Darji, Callie C. Liao, Duoduo Liao

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:39:03Z

**Summary**: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

### Lessons from the TREC Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts   (PLABA) track
**Authors**: Brian Ondov, William Xia, Kush Attal, Ishita Unde, Jerry He, Hoa Dang, Ian Soboroff, Dina Demner-Fushman

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:23:52Z

**Summary**: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.   Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.   Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.   Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

### Learning to Reason at the Frontier of Learnability
**Authors**: Thomas Foster, Anya Sims, Johannes Forkel, Mattie Fellows, Jakob Foerster

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:21:27Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

### DPMT: Dual Process Multi-scale Theory of Mind Framework for Real-time   Human-AI Collaboration
**Authors**: Xiyun Li, Yining Ding, Yuhua Jiang, Yunlong Zhao, Runpeng Xie, Shuang Xu, Yuanhua Ni, Yiqin Yang, Bo Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:13:21Z

**Summary**: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM) module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

### Sparse Rewards Can Self-Train Dialogue Agents
**Authors**: Barrett Martin Lattimer, Varun Gangal, Ryan McDonald, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:06:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Model (LLM) agents, especially in multi-turn dialogue tasks, have been primarily driven by supervised fine-tuning and high-quality human feedback. However, as base LLM models continue to improve, acquiring meaningful human feedback has become increasingly challenging and costly. In certain domains, base LLM agents may eventually exceed human capabilities, making traditional feedback-driven methods impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-improvement paradigm that empowers LLM agents to autonomously enhance their performance without external human feedback. Our method, Juxtaposed Outcomes for Simulation Harvesting (JOSH), is a self-alignment algorithm that leverages a sparse reward simulation environment to extract ideal behaviors and further train the LLM on its own outputs. We present ToolWOZ, a sparse reward tool-calling simulation environment derived from MultiWOZ. We demonstrate that models trained with JOSH, both small and frontier, significantly improve tool-based interactions while preserving general model capabilities across diverse benchmarks. Our code and data are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/asappresearch/josh-llm-simulation-training

### DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of   Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits
**Authors**: Garapati Keerthana, Manik Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:00:27Z

**Summary**: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.   We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.   We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.

**Authors**: Shuiguang Deng, Di Yu, Changze Lv, Xin Du, Linshan Jiang, Xiaofan Zhao, Wentao Tong, Xiaoqing Zheng, Weijia Fang, Peng Zhao, Gang Pan, Schahram Dustdar, Albert Y. Zomaya

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:47:52Z

**Summary**: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

### On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for   Multi-Programming Language Understanding
**Authors**: Haoyuan Wu, Rui Ming, Jilong Gao, Hangyu Zhao, Xueyi Chen, Yikai Yang, Haisheng Zheng, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:43:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.

**Authors**: Paweł Budzianowski, Wesley Maa, Matthew Freed, Jingxiang Mo, Winston Hsiao, Aaron Xie, Tomasz Młoduchowski, Viraj Tipnis, Benjamin Bolte

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:15:09Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training \href{https://github.com/kscalelabs/evla }{codebase} to foster further research.

**Authors**: Sumanth Doddapaneni, Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan, Dilip Venkatesh, Raj Dabre, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Mitesh M. Khapra

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:14:51Z

**Summary**: Evaluating machine-generated text remains a significant challenge in NLP, especially for non-English languages. Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly available to enable further research in this important area.

### Evaluating the Effectiveness of Cost-Efficient Large Language Models in   Benchmark Biomedical Tasks
**Authors**: Israt Jahan, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Chun Peng, Jimmy Huang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:13:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better), with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

### Extreme value distribution for GRB prompt data -- How unexpected was the   BOAT event?
**Authors**: Stefano Covino

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:11:12Z

**Summary**: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to be unpredictable in time and position. A few (observationally) exceptional events have been observed, as GRB221009A that stands out for its fluence and peak flux, being orders of magnitude higher than what measured so far. Analyzing the observed fluence, peak flux or duration distributions typically requires one to assume some scenarios, and the consistency of the observed data with the predictions turns out to be an important model diagnostic. However, it is also of interest to model these distributions using general statistical properties that do not rely on specific model assumptions, allowing one to derive inferences only based on the consistency of the observed distributions with the hypothesis of one single population of events that generate them. We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and durations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM instruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and modelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism. The GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number of observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena producing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences, peak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single population of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A constitutes a striking exception. The probability to observe such an event, assuming it is a cosmological GRB, is low, with a median value of about one event per millennium for the fluence and about one event per century for the peak flux.

### Toward Practical Fluid Antenna Systems: Co-Optimizing Hardware and   Software for Port Selection and Beamforming
**Authors**: Sai Xu, Kai-Kit Wong, Yanan Du, Hanjiang Hong, Chan-Byoung Chae, Baiyang Liu, Kin-Fai Tong

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:07:36Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a hardware-software co-design approach to efficiently optimize beamforming and port selection in fluid antenna systems (FASs). To begin with, a fluid-antenna (FA)-enabled downlink multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network is modeled, and a weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated. Second, a method that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with random port selection (RPS) is proposed to jointly optimize beamforming and port selection, while also assessing the benefits and limitations of random selection. Third, an instruction-driven deep learning accelerator based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is developed to minimize inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, a scheduling algorithm is introduced to reduce redundant computations and minimize the idle time of computing cores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GNN-RPS approach achieves competitive communication performance. Furthermore, experimental evaluations indicate that the FPGA-based accelerator maintains low latency while simultaneously executing beamforming inference for multiple port selections.

### Architecting Human-AI Cocreation for Technical Services -- Interaction   Modes and Contingency Factors
**Authors**: Jochen Wulf, Jurg Meierhofer, Frank Hannich

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:06:03Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), offer transformative potential for value co-creation in technical services. However, persistent challenges like hallucinations and operational brittleness limit their autonomous use, creating a critical need for robust frameworks to guide human-AI collaboration. Drawing on established Human-AI teaming research and analogies from fields like autonomous driving, this paper develops a structured taxonomy of human-agent interaction. Based on case study research within technical support platforms, we propose a six-mode taxonomy that organizes collaboration across a spectrum of AI autonomy. This spectrum is anchored by the Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL) model for full automation and the Human-Augmented Model (HAM) for passive AI assistance. Between these poles, the framework specifies four distinct intermediate structures. These include the Human-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human approval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows with deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation upon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables discretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key contingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system reliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a systematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human oversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the trade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of safer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems.

### KROMA: Ontology Matching with Knowledge Retrieval and Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Lam Nguyen, Erika Barcelos, Roger French, Yinghui Wu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:00:11Z

**Summary**: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.

### Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jinhao Liu, Dengyun Peng, Jiannan Guan, Peng Wang, Mengkang Hu, Yuhang Zhou, Te Gao, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:57:54Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

### QuantEIT: Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference for Chest   Electrical Impedance Tomography
**Authors**: Hao Fang, Sihao Teng, Hao Yu, Siyi Yuan, Huaiwu He, Zhe Liu, Yunjie Yang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:57:53Z

**Summary**: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here, we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network (QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced robustness to noise.

### On the importance of tail assumptions in climate extreme event   attribution
**Authors**: Mengran Li, Daniela Castro-Camilo

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:35:17Z

**Summary**: Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, posing serious threats to human life, biodiversity, and ecosystems. A key objective of extreme event attribution (EEA) is to assess whether and to what extent anthropogenic climate change influences such events. Central to EEA is the accurate statistical characterization of atmospheric extremes, which are inherently multivariate or spatial due to their measurement over high-dimensional grids. Within the counterfactual causal inference framework of Pearl, we evaluate how tail assumptions affect attribution conclusions by comparing three multivariate modeling approaches for estimating causation metrics. These include: (i) the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution, which imposes an invariant tail dependence structure; (ii) the factor copula model of Castro-Camilo and Huser (2020), which offers flexible subasymptotic behavior; and (iii) the model of Huser and Wadsworth (2019), which smoothly transitions between different forms of extremal dependence. We assess the implications of these modeling choices in both simulated scenarios (under varying forms of model misspecification) and real data applications, using weekly winter maxima over Europe from the M\'et\'eo-France CNRM model and daily precipitation from the ACCESS-CM2 model over the U.S. Our findings highlight that tail assumptions critically shape causality metrics in EEA. Misspecification of the extremal dependence structure can lead to substantially different and potentially misleading attribution conclusions, underscoring the need for careful model selection and evaluation when quantifying the influence of climate change on extreme events.

### Efficient Temporal Tokenization for Mobility Prediction with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Haoyu He, Haozheng Luo, Yan Chen, Qi R. Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:31:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4% improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Photonic Fabric Platform for AI Accelerators
**Authors**: Jing Ding, Trung Diep

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:14:56Z

**Summary**: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM (PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA, without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and 1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of fixed memory to compute.

### Progressively Exploring and Exploiting Cost-Free Data to Break   Fine-Grained Classification Barriers
**Authors**: Li-Jun Zhao, Zhen-Duo Chen, Zhi-Yuan Xue, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:58:15Z

**Summary**: Current fine-grained classification research primarily focuses on fine-grained feature learning. However, in real-world scenarios, fine-grained data annotation is challenging, and the features and semantics are highly diverse and frequently changing. These issues create inherent barriers between traditional experimental settings and real-world applications, limiting the effectiveness of conventional fine-grained classification methods. Although some recent studies have provided potential solutions to these issues, most of them still rely on limited supervised information and thus fail to offer effective solutions. In this paper, based on theoretical analysis, we propose a novel learning paradigm to break the barriers in fine-grained classification. This paradigm enables the model to progressively learn during inference, thereby leveraging cost-free data to more accurately represent fine-grained categories and adapt to dynamic semantic changes. On this basis, an efficient EXPloring and EXPloiting strategy and method (EXP2) is designed. Thereinto, useful inference data samples are explored according to class representations and exploited to optimize classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate the general effectiveness of our method, providing guidance for future in-depth understanding and exploration of real-world fine-grained classification.

### Inflated hot Jupiters: inferring average atmospheric velocity via Ohmic   models coupled with internal dynamo evolution
**Authors**: Daniele Viganò, Soumya Sengupta, Clàudia Soriano-Guerrero, Rosalba Perna, Albert Elias-López, Sandeep Kumar, Taner Akgün

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:58:03Z

**Summary**: The inflated radii observed in hundreds of hot Jupiters (HJ) represent a long-standing open issue. In this study, we quantitatively investigate this phenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic induction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets with {\tt MESA}, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium temperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that extends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind intensities, averaged in the region $p\lesssim 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.

### Agentic Neural Networks: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Textual   Backpropagation
**Authors**: Xiaowen Ma, Chenyang Lin, Yao Zhang, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:52:19Z

**Summary**: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

### DreamScene: 3D Gaussian-based End-to-end Text-to-3D Scene Generation
**Authors**: Haoran Li, Yuli Tian, Kun Lan, Yong Liao, Lin Wang, Pan Hui, Peng Yuan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:45:54Z

**Summary**: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and 4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at https://dreamscene-project.github.io.

### Interpretable Imitation Learning via Generative Adversarial STL   Inference and Control
**Authors**: Wenliang Liu, Danyang Li, Erfan Aasi, Daniela Rus, Roberto Tron, Calin Belta

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:44:19Z

**Summary**: Imitation learning methods have demonstrated considerable success in teaching autonomous systems complex tasks through expert demonstrations. However, a limitation of these methods is their lack of interpretability, particularly in understanding the specific task the learning agent aims to accomplish. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning method that combines Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference and control synthesis, enabling the explicit representation of the task as an STL formula. This approach not only provides a clear understanding of the task but also supports the integration of human knowledge and allows for adaptation to out-of-distribution scenarios by manually adjusting the STL formulas and fine-tuning the policy. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-inspired approach to train both the inference and policy networks, effectively narrowing the gap between expert and learned policies. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, showcasing its practical applicability and adaptability.

**Authors**: Casper Bröcheler, Thomas Vroom, Derrick Timmermans, Alan van den Akker, Guangzhi Tang, Charalampos S. Kouzinopoulos, Rico Möckel

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:32:45Z

**Summary**: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

### A regression-based approach for bidirectional proximal causal inference   in the presence of unmeasured confounding
**Authors**: Jiaqi Min, Xueyue Zhang, Shanshan Luo

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:28:11Z

**Summary**: Proxy variables are commonly used in causal inference when unmeasured confounding exists. While most existing proximal methods assume a unidirectional causal relationship between two primary variables, many social and biological systems exhibit complex feedback mechanisms that imply bidirectional causality. In this paper, using regression-based models, we extend the proximal framework to identify bidirectional causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We establish the identification of bidirectional causal effects and develop a sensitivity analysis method for violations of the proxy structural conditions. Building on this identification result, we derive bidirectional two-stage least squares estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normal under standard regularity conditions. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach delivers unbiased causal effect estimates and outperforms some standard methods. The simulation results also confirm the reliability of the sensitivity analysis procedure. Applying our methodology to a state-level panel dataset from 1985 to 2014 in the United States, we examine the bidirectional causal effects between abortion rates and murder rates. The analysis reveals a consistent negative effect of abortion rates on murder rates, while also detecting a potential reciprocal effect from murder rates to abortion rates that conventional unidirectional analyses have not considered.

### DUALRec: A Hybrid Sequential and Language Model Framework for   Context-Aware Movie Recommendation
**Authors**: Yitong Li, Raoul Grasman

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:22:05Z

**Summary**: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec (Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

### Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
**Authors**: Yutao Jin, Haowen Xiao, Jielei Chu, Fengmao Lv, Yuxiao Li, Tianrui Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:21:24Z

**Summary**: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

### Estimating Cognitive Effort from Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy   (fNIRS) Signals using Machine Learning
**Authors**: Shayla Sharmin, Roghayeh Leila Barmaki

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:20:54Z

**Summary**: The estimation of cognitive effort could potentially help educators to modify material to enhance learning effectiveness and student engagement. Where cognitive load refers how much work the brain is doing while someone is learning or doing a task cognitive effort consider both load and behavioral performance. Cognitive effort can be captured by measuring oxygen flow and behavioral performance during a task. This study infers cognitive effort metrics using machine learning models based on oxygenated hemoglobin collected by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy from the prefrontal cortex during an educational gameplay. In our study, sixteen participants responded to sixteen questions in an in-house Unity-based educational game. The quiz was divided into two sessions, each session consisting of two task segments. We extracted temporal statistical and functional connectivity features from collected oxygenated hemoglobin and analyzed their correlation with quiz performance. We trained multiple machine learning models to predict quiz performance from oxygenated hemoglobin features and achieved accuracies ranging from 58\% to 67\% accuracy. These predictions were used to calculate cognitive effort via relative neural involvement and efficiency, which consider both brain activation and behavioral performance. Although quiz score predictions achieved moderate accuracy, the derived relative neural efficiency and involvement values remained robust. Since both metrics are based on the relative positions of standardized brain activation and performance scores, even small misclassifications in predicted scores preserved the overall cognitive effort trends observed during gameplay.

### Exploiting Primacy Effect To Improve Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bianca Raimondi, Maurizio Gabbrielli

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:18:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.

### Preprint: Did I Just Browse A Website Written by LLMs?
**Authors**: Sichang "Steven" He, Ramesh Govindan, Harsha V. Madhyastha

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:09:04Z

**Summary**: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient, because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content has complex markup and diverse genres.   We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web ecosystem.

### Reframing attention as a reinforcement learning problem for causal   discovery
**Authors**: Turan Orujlu, Christian Gumbsch, Martin V. Butz, Charley M Wu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:50:57Z

**Summary**: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore, we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover graphs of dynamic causal processes.

### The Levers of Political Persuasion with Conversational AI
**Authors**: Kobi Hackenburg, Ben M. Tappin, Luke Hewitt, Ed Saunders, Sid Black, Hause Lin, Catherine Fist, Helen Margetts, David G. Rand, Christopher Summerfield

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:50:09Z

**Summary**: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims. Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27% respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly, where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased factual accuracy.

### Confidence Intervals for Random Forest Permutation Importance with   Missing Data
**Authors**: Nico Föge, Markus Pauly

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:49:50Z

**Summary**: Random Forests are renowned for their predictive accuracy, but valid inference, particularly about permutation-based feature importances, remains challenging. Existing methods, such as the confidence intervals (CIs) from Ishwaran et al. (2019), are promising but assume complete feature observation. However, real-world data often contains missing values. In this paper, we investigate how common imputation techniques affect the validity of Random Forest permutation-importance CIs when data are incomplete. Through an extensive simulation and real-world benchmark study, we compare state-of-the-art imputation methods across various missing-data mechanisms and missing rates. Our results show that single-imputation strategies lead to low CI coverage. As a remedy, we adapt Rubin's rule to aggregate feature-importance estimates and their variances over several imputed datasets and account for imputation uncertainty. Our numerical results indicate that the adjusted CIs achieve better nominal coverage.

### The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars
**Authors**: Alexandra Lorange, Jérôme Pétri, Mattéo Sautron

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:16:31Z

**Summary**: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination $i$, thus $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light-curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between those two angles ($i$ and $\zeta$) for a significant fraction of our sample, between 1/2 and 2/3, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one third of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.

### Using LLMs to identify features of personal and professional skills in   an open-response situational judgment test
**Authors**: Cole Walsh, Rodica Ivan, Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Colleen Robb

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:59:17Z

**Summary**: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

### Large Language Models as Innovators: A Framework to Leverage Latent   Space Exploration for Novelty Discovery
**Authors**: Mateusz Bystroński, Mikołaj Hołysz, Grzegorz Piotrowski, Nitesh V. Chawla, Tomasz Kajdanowicz

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:54:28Z

**Summary**: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.

### Permutation patterns in streams
**Authors**: Benjamin Aram Berendsohn

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:46:45Z

**Summary**: Permutation patterns and pattern avoidance are central, well-studied concepts in combinatorics and computer science. Given two permutations $\tau$ and $\pi$, the pattern matching problem (PPM) asks whether $\tau$ contains $\pi$. This problem arises in various contexts in computer science and statistics and has been studied extensively in exact-, parameterized-, approximate-, property-testing- and other formulations.   In this paper, we study pattern matching in a streaming setting, when the input $\tau$ is revealed sequentially, one element at a time. There is extensive work on the space complexity of various statistics in streams of integers. The novelty of our setting is that the input stream is a permutation, which allows inferring some information about future inputs. Our algorithms crucially take advantage of this fact, while existing lower bound techniques become difficult to apply.   We show that the complexity of the problem changes dramatically depending on the pattern $\pi$. The space requirement is: $\Theta(k\log{n})$ for the monotone patterns $\pi = 12\dots k$, or $\pi = k\dots21$, $O(\sqrt{n\log{n}})$ for $\pi \in \{312,132\}$, $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ for $\pi \in \{231,213\}$, and $\widetilde{\Theta}_{\pi}(n)$ for all other $\pi$. If $\tau$ is an arbitrary sequence of integers (not necessary a permutation), we show that the complexity is $\widetilde{\Theta}_{\pi}(n)$ in all except the first (monotone) cases.

### Towards scientific discovery with dictionary learning: Extracting   biological concepts from microscopy foundation models
**Authors**: Konstantin Donhauser, Kristina Ulicna, Gemma Elyse Moran, Aditya Ravuri, Kian Kenyon-Dean, Cian Eastwood, Jason Hartford

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:37:43Z

**Summary**: Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract semantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models (LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.

### HoH: A Dynamic Benchmark for Evaluating the Impact of Outdated   Information on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jie Ouyang, Tingyue Pan, Mingyue Cheng, Ruiran Yan, Yucong Luo, Jiaying Lin, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:34:45Z

**Summary**: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/0russwest0/HoH.

### SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data   Memorization and Knowledge Injection
**Authors**: Aleksandr Gashkov, Aleksandr Perevalov, Maria Eltsova, Andreas Both

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:28:08Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems, generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf. LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM, s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is possible.

### Depth3DLane: Fusing Monocular 3D Lane Detection with Self-Supervised   Monocular Depth Estimation
**Authors**: Max van den Hoven, Kishaan Jeeveswaran, Pieter Piscaer, Thijs Wensveen, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:23:47Z

**Summary**: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information. Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry. Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

### InTraVisTo: Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool
**Authors**: Nicolò Brunello, Davide Rigamonti, Andrea Sassella, Vincenzo Scotti, Mark James Carman

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:23:47Z

**Summary**: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity. Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool, InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram). With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

### Bias in Decision-Making for AI's Ethical Dilemmas: A Comparative Study   of ChatGPT and Claude
**Authors**: Yile Yan, Yuqi Zhu, Wentao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:09:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study investigates protected attributes in LLMs through systematic evaluation of their responses to ethical dilemmas. Using two prominent models - GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet - we analyzed their decision-making patterns across multiple protected attributes including age, gender, race, appearance, and disability status. Through 11,200 experimental trials involving both single-factor and two-factor protected attribute combinations, we evaluated the models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering of preferences. Our findings reveal significant protected attributeses in both models, with consistent preferences for certain features (e.g., "good-looking") and systematic neglect of others. Notably, while GPT-3.5 Turbo showed stronger preferences aligned with traditional power structures, Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated more diverse protected attribute choices. We also found that ethical sensitivity significantly decreases in more complex scenarios involving multiple protected attributes. Additionally, linguistic referents heavily influence the models' ethical evaluations, as demonstrated by differing responses to racial descriptors (e.g., "Yellow" versus "Asian"). These findings highlight critical concerns about the potential impact of LLM biases in autonomous decision-making systems and emphasize the need for careful consideration of protected attributes in AI development. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on AI ethics by providing a systematic framework for evaluating protected attributes in LLMs' ethical decision-making capabilities.

### Modeling Fair Play in Detective Stories with Language Models
**Authors**: Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:55:18Z

**Summary**: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story, and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right. Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which greatly contributes to their poor quality.

### DistFlow: A Fully Distributed RL Framework for Scalable and Efficient   LLM Post-Training
**Authors**: Zhixin Wang, Tianyi Zhou, Liming Liu, Ao Li, Jiarui Hu, Dian Yang, Jinlong Hou, Siyuan Feng, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Qi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:41:49Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the pivotal post-training technique for large language model. Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe, goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.

**Authors**: Runcong Zhao, Artem Bobrov, Jiazheng Li, Yulan He

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:37:12Z

**Summary**: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.

### Visual Grounding Methods for Efficient Interaction with Desktop   Graphical User Interfaces
**Authors**: El Hassane Ettifouri, Jessica López Espejel, Laura Minkova, Tassnim Dardouri, Walid Dahhane

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:35:01Z

**Summary**: Most visual grounding solutions primarily focus on realistic images. However, applications involving synthetic images, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), remain limited. This restricts the development of autonomous computer vision-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents for automatic application interaction. Enabling AI to effectively understand and interact with GUIs is crucial to advancing automation in software testing, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we explore Instruction Visual Grounding (IVG), a multi-modal approach to object identification within a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and a GUI screen, IVG locates the coordinates of the element on the screen where the instruction should be executed. We propose two main methods: (1) IVGocr, which combines a Large Language Model (LLM), an object detection model, and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module; and (2) IVGdirect, which uses a multimodal architecture for end-to-end grounding. For each method, we introduce a dedicated dataset. In addition, we propose the Central Point Validation (CPV) metric, a relaxed variant of the classical Central Proximity Score (CPS) metric. Our final test dataset is publicly released to support future research.

### Question-Answer Extraction from Scientific Articles Using Knowledge   Graphs and Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hosein Azarbonyad, Zi Long Zhu, Georgios Cheirmpos, Zubair Afzal, Vikrant Yadav, Georgios Tsatsaronis

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:31:52Z

**Summary**: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research, scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

### RAG-based Architectures for Drug Side Effect Retrieval in LLMs
**Authors**: Shad Nygren, Pinar Avci, Andre Daniels, Reza Rassol, Afshin Beheshti, Diego Galeano

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:20:52Z

**Summary**: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.

### Team of One: Cracking Complex Video QA with Model Synergy
**Authors**: Jun Xie, Zhaoran Zhao, Xiongjun Guan, Yingjian Zhu, Hongzhu Yi, Xinming Wang, Feng Chen, Zhepeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:12:44Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs) via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways. An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator, selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for future Video-LMM development.

**Authors**: Dawar Khan, Xinyu Liu, Omar Mena, Donggang Jia, Alexandre Kouyoumdjian, Ivan Viola

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:10:07Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present AIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running on XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across four XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified evaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based setups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our findings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

### DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Tamim Al Mahmud, Najeeb Jebreel, Josep Domingo-Ferrer, David Sanchez

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:56:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

### Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language   Models on Social Media
**Authors**: Wenlu Fan, Yuqi Zhu, Chenyang Wang, Bin Wang, Wentao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:53:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.

### CodeEdu: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Platform for Personalized Coding   Education
**Authors**: Jianing Zhao, Peng Gao, Jiannong Cao, Zhiyuan Wen, Chen Chen, Jianing Yin, Ruosong Yang, Bo Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:52:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in improving coding education by providing support for code writing, explanation, and debugging. However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess students' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material aligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning. Current work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to understand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent research has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated problems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in the field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu, an innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool use to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static pipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student needs. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically, including task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA, step-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report generation, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task efficiency. Automated evaluations reveal that CodeEdu substantially enhances students' coding performance.

### Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube
**Authors**: Alex Wen

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:39:58Z

**Summary**: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.

### LightCurve MoE: A Dynamic Sparse Routing Mixture-of-Experts Architecture   for Efficient Stellar Light Curve Classification
**Authors**: Cunshi Wang, Yu Bai, Xinrui Song, Jiacheng Xu, Henggeng Han, Yuyang Li, Xinjie Hu, Huiqin Yang, Jifeng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:34:56Z

**Summary**: The classification of stellar light curves has become a key task in modern time-domain astronomy, fueled by the rapid growth of data from large-scale surveys such as Kepler and TESS. Although deep learning models have achieved high accuracy in this area, their computational costs can limit scalability. To tackle this issue, we propose LightCurve MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that combines dynamic sparse routing with a dual-gating mechanism to balance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Our model includes five specialized experts, each using a different feature extraction method-such as wavelet transforms, Gramian angular fields, and recurrence plots-to capture unique patterns in the light curves. A dual-gating mechanism evaluates these expert outputs by analyzing both frequency and time-domain features, allowing the model to adaptively weigh each expert's contribution. During inference, only the top 3 out of 5 experts are activated per sample using a Top-k routing strategy, reducing computational cost by 40% compared to dense models while preserving strong accuracy (96%). The model also includes entropy regularization and a technique to retain inactive experts during training, ensuring stable and effective learning. By combining sparse computation with multi-modal feature fusion, LightCurve MoE offers a scalable solution for future large-scale photometric surveys like LSST and Global Open Transient Telescope Array (GOTTA), where processing efficiency is crucial due to the massive volume of daily data.

### Efficient Bayesian analysis of kilonovae and GRB afterglows with fiesta
**Authors**: Hauke Koehn, Thibeau Wouters, Peter T. H. Pang, Mattia Bulla, Henrik Rose, Hannah Wichern, Tim Dietrich

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:34:49Z

**Summary**: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) are electromagnetic transients that can accompany binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Therefore, studying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining cosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common method to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian posterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However, sampling the posterior is computationally costly, and because of the many likelihood evaluations needed in this process, detailed models are too expensive to be used directly in inference. In the present article, we address this problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning (ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that can accelerate likelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for the state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, as well as a new surrogate for the KN emission as modeled by the possis code. Our surrogates enable evaluation of the lightcurve posterior within minutes. We also provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on the flowMC package which scale efficiently to higher dimensions when adding up to tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX framework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate training and posterior sampling. We apply our framework to reanalyze AT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A using our surrogates, thus employing the new pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference.

### One Step Closer: Creating the Future to Boost Monocular Semantic Scene   Completion
**Authors**: Haoang Lu, Yuanqi Su, Xiaoning Zhang, Hao Hu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:24:58Z

**Summary**: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past, present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships. Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and 3D scene completion accuracy.

### Code Readability in the Age of Large Language Models: An Industrial Case   Study from Atlassian
**Authors**: Wannita Takerngsaksiri, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn, Micheal Fu, Jirat Pasuksmit, Kun Chen, Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:09:05Z

**Summary**: Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process, especially in the age of large language models (LLMs) that can automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.

### Debiased Machine Learning for Unobserved Heterogeneity: High-Dimensional   Panels and Measurement Error Models
**Authors**: Facundo Argañaraz, Juan Carlos Escanciano

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:00:24Z

**Summary**: Developing robust inference for models with nonparametric Unobserved Heterogeneity (UH) is both important and challenging. We propose novel Debiased Machine Learning (DML) procedures for valid inference on functionals of UH, allowing for partial identification of multivariate target and high-dimensional nuisance parameters. Our main contribution is a full characterization of all relevant Neyman-orthogonal moments in models with nonparametric UH, where relevance means informativeness about the parameter of interest. Under additional support conditions, orthogonal moments are globally robust to the distribution of the UH. They may still involve other high-dimensional nuisance parameters, but their local robustness reduces regularization bias and enables valid DML inference. We apply these results to: (i) common parameters, average marginal effects, and variances of UH in panel data models with high-dimensional controls; (ii) moments of the common factor in the Kotlarski model with a factor loading; and (iii) smooth functionals of teacher value-added. Monte Carlo simulations show substantial efficiency gains from using efficient orthogonal moments relative to ad-hoc choices. We illustrate the practical value of our approach by showing that existing estimates of the average and variance effects of maternal smoking on child birth weight are robust.

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:55:51Z

**Summary**: Recent observations with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) have revealed 19 nearby M dwarfs showing bright circularly polarised radio emission. One of the possible sources of such emission is through magnetic star-planet interactions (MSPI) with unseen close-in planets. We present initial results from a spectroscopic survey with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs designed to characterize this sample and further investigate the origin of the radio emission. We provide four new insights into the sample. I) We uniformly characterize the stellar properties, constraining their effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities, rotation periods, stellar radii, and stellar inclinations where possible. Further, from a homogenous analysis of the HPF spectra, we infer their chromospheric activity and spectroscopic multiplicity states. From this, we identify GJ 625, GJ 1151, and LHS 2395 as single, quiescent stars amenable to precise RV follow-up, making them strong MSPI candidates. II) We show that the distribution of stellar inclinations are compatible with an isotropic distribution, providing no evidence for a preference to pole-on configurations. III) We refine the radial velocity solution for GJ 625 b, the only currently known close-in planet in the sample, reducing the uncertainty in its orbital period by a factor of three, to facilitate future phase-dependent radio analysis. IV) Finally, we identify GJ 3861 as a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of $P=14.841181_{-0.00010}^{+0.00011}$ d, making it the only confirmed binary with a relatively short orbit in the sample, where we surmise the radio emission is likely related to magnetospheric interactions between the two stars. These results advance our understanding of radio-emitting M dwarfs and establish an observational foundation for identifying MSPI.

### Data-Driven Reduced-Order Models for Port-Hamiltonian Systems with   Operator Inference
**Authors**: Yuwei Geng, Lili Ju, Boris Kramer, Zhu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:37:22Z

**Summary**: Hamiltonian operator inference has been developed in [Sharma, H., Wang, Z., Kramer, B., Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 431, p.133122, 2022] to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models (ROMs) for Hamiltonian systems. The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.

### ExtracTable: Human-in-the-Loop Transformation of Scientific Corpora into   Structured Knowledge
**Authors**: Lena John, Ahmed Malek Ghanmi, Tim Wittenborg, Sören Auer, Oliver Karras

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:35:18Z

**Summary**: As the volume of scientific literature grows, efficient knowledge organization becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional approaches to structuring scientific content are time-consuming and require significant domain expertise, highlighting the need for tool support. We present ExtracTable, a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow and framework that assists researchers in transforming unstructured publications into structured representations. The workflow combines large language models (LLMs) with user-defined schemas and is designed for downstream integration into knowledge graphs (KGs). Developed and evaluated in the context of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), ExtracTable automates key steps such as document preprocessing and data extraction while ensuring user oversight through validation. In an evaluation with ORKG community participants following the Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP), ExtracTable demonstrated high usability and practical value. Participants gave it an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84.17 (A+, the highest rating). The time to progress from a research interest to literature-based insights was reduced from between 4 hours and 2 weeks to an average of 24:40 minutes. By streamlining corpus creation and structured data extraction for knowledge graph integration, ExtracTable leverages LLMs and user models to accelerate literature reviews. However, human validation remains essential to ensure quality, and future work will address improving extraction accuracy and entity linking to existing knowledge resources.

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:31:19Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires robust benchmarks that encompass not only academic domains but also industrial fields to effectively evaluate their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce two Korean expert-level benchmarks. KMMLU-Redux, reconstructed from the existing KMMLU, consists of questions from the Korean National Technical Qualification exams, with critical errors removed to enhance reliability. KMMLU-Pro is based on Korean National Professional Licensure exams to reflect professional knowledge in Korea. Our experiments demonstrate that these benchmarks comprehensively represent industrial knowledge in Korea. We release our dataset publicly available.

### On consistency of the MLE under finite mixtures of location-scale   distributions with a structural parameter
**Authors**: Guanfu Liu, Pengfei Li, Yukun Liu, Xiaolong Pu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:16:55Z

**Summary**: We provide a general and rigorous proof for the strong consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of the cumulative distribution function of the mixing distribution and structural parameter under finite mixtures of location-scale distributions with a structural parameter. The consistency results do not require the parameter space of location and scale to be compact. We illustrate the results by applying them to finite mixtures of location-scale distributions with the component density function being one of the commonly used density functions: normal, logistic, extreme-value, or $t$. An extension of the strong consistency results to finite mixtures of multivariate elliptical distributions is also discussed.

### SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Liangbin Xie, Yu Li, Shian Du, Menghan Xia, Xintao Wang, Fanghua Yu, Ziyan Chen, Pengfei Wan, Jiantao Zhou, Chao Dong

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:15:39Z

**Summary**: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

**Authors**: Yaowei Jin, Junjie Wang, Wenkai Xiang, Duanhua Cao, Dan Teng, Zhehuan Fan, Jiacheng Xiong, Xia Sheng, Chuanlong Zeng, Mingyue Zheng, Qian Shi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:15:35Z

**Summary**: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.

### OntView: What you See is What you Meant
**Authors**: Carlos Bobed, Carlota Quintana, Eduardo Mena, Jorge Bobed, Fernando Bobillo

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:06:49Z

**Summary**: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users' ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological frameworks.   In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm, showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload, OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts (according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics. OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

### The Emperor's New Chain-of-Thought: Probing Reasoning Theater Bias in   Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Yubo Fan, Zhenheng Tang, Nuo Chen, Wenxuan Wang, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:06:10Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and o1 are increasingly used as automated evaluators, raising critical questions about their vulnerability to the aesthetics of reasoning in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We introduce THEATER, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate this vulnerability-termed Reasoning Theater Bias (RTB)-by comparing LLMs and LRMs across subjective preference and objective factual datasets. Through investigation of six bias types including Simple Cues and Fake Chain-of-Thought, we uncover three key findings: (1) in a critical paradox, reasoning-specialized LRMs are consistently more susceptible to RTB than general-purpose LLMs, particularly in subjective tasks; (2) this creates a task-dependent trade-off, where LRMs show more robustness on factual tasks but less on subjective ones; and (3) we identify 'shallow reasoning'-plausible but flawed arguments-as the most potent form of RTB. To address this, we design and evaluate two prompting strategies: a targeted system prompt that improves accuracy by up to 12% on factual tasks but only 1-3% on subjective tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that shows similarly limited effectiveness in the more vulnerable subjective domains. Our work reveals that RTB is a deep-seated challenge for LRM-based evaluation and provides a systematic framework for developing more genuinely robust and trustworthy LRMs.

### Modeling HMI observables for the study of solar oscillations
**Authors**: D. Fournier, N. M. Kostogryz, L. Gizon, J. Schou, V. Witzke, A. I. Shapiro, I. Milic

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:00:05Z

**Summary**: Context: Helioseismology aims to infer the properties of the solar interior by analyzing observations of acoustic oscillations. The interpretation of the helioseismic data is however complicated by the non-trivial relationship between helioseismic observables and the physical perturbations associated with acoustic modes, as well as by various instrumental effects. Aims: We aim to improve our understanding of the signature of acoustic modes measured in the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) continuum intensity and Doppler velocity observables by accounting for radiative transfer, solar background rotation, and spacecraft velocity. Methods: We start with a background model atmosphere that accurately reproduces solar limb darkening and the Fe I 6173{\AA} spectral line profile. We employ first-order perturbation theory to model the effect of acoustic oscillations on inferred intensity and velocity. By solving the radiative transfer equation in the atmosphere, we synthesize the spectral line, convolve it with the six HMI spectral windows, and deduce continuum intensity (hmi.Ic_45s) and Doppler velocity (hmi.V_45s) according to the HMI algorithm. Results: We analytically derive the relationship between mode displacement in the atmosphere and the HMI observables, and show that both intensity and velocity deviate significantly from simple approximations. Specifically, the continuum intensity does not simply reflect the true continuum value, while the line-of-sight velocity does not correspond to a straightforward projection of the velocity at a fixed height in the atmosphere. Our results indicate that these deviations are substantial, with amplitudes of approximately 10% and phase shifts of around 10 degrees across the detector for both observables. Moreover, these effects are highly dependent on the acoustic mode under consideration and the position on the solar disk.

### Encapsulated Composition of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video Models for   High-Quality Video Synthesis
**Authors**: Tongtong Su, Chengyu Wang, Bingyan Liu, Jun Huang, Dongming Lu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:59:02Z

**Summary**: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes: https://github.com/Tonniia/EVS.

### PRIDE -- Parameter-Efficient Reduction of Identity Discrimination for   Equality in LLMs
**Authors**: Maluna Menke, Thilo Hagendorff

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:44:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of 100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1% additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%. Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements. These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT, the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

### Search-Optimized Quantization in Biomedical Ontology Alignment
**Authors**: Oussama Bouaggad, Natalia Grabar

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:42:20Z

**Summary**: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately 70%.

### From Words to Collisions: LLM-Guided Evaluation and Adversarial   Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios
**Authors**: Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Korbinian Moller, Amr Alanwar, Johannes Betz

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:39:33Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.

### DailyLLM: Context-Aware Activity Log Generation Using Multi-Modal   Sensors and LLMs
**Authors**: Ye Tian, Xiaoyuan Ren, Zihao Wang, Onat Gungor, Xiaofan Yu, Tajana Rosing

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:33:30Z

**Summary**: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing. The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.

### Prompt-Tuning Bandits: Enabling Few-Shot Generalization for Efficient   Multi-Task Offline RL
**Authors**: Finn Rietz, Oleg Smirnov, Sara Karimi, Lele Cao

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:29:35Z

**Summary**: Prompting has emerged as the dominant paradigm for adapting large, pre-trained transformer-based models to downstream tasks. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. This limits generalization and adaptation, especially in low-data or open-world settings where sample efficiency is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, inference-time, bandit-based prompt-tuning framework. The bandit explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance, while avoiding costly fine-tuning of the transformer backbone. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines. These results highlights the importance of adaptive prompt selection mechanisms for efficient generalization in offline multi-task RL.

### The Judge Variable: Challenging Judge-Agnostic Legal Judgment Prediction
**Authors**: Guillaume Zambrano

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:28:53Z

**Summary**: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made available.

### VFaith: Do Large Multimodal Models Really Reason on Seen Images Rather   than Previous Memories?
**Authors**: Jiachen Yu, Yufei Zhan, Ziheng Wu, Yousong Zhu, Jinqiao Wang, Minghui Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:23:14Z

**Summary**: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced. However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore, evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction. Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task. We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench, further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

**Summary**: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.

### Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Weiyi You, Mingyang Zhang, Leheng Zhang, Xingyu Zhou, Kexuan Shi, Shuhang Gu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:13:07Z

**Summary**: Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.

**Authors**: Boris Bonev, Thorsten Kurth, Ankur Mahesh, Mauro Bisson, Jean Kossaifi, Karthik Kashinath, Anima Anandkumar, William D. Collins, Michael S. Pritchard, Alexander Keller

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:05:51Z

**Summary**: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable, geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting. The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3 delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8 to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches, FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on 1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model- and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a single GPU, producing a 60-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly resolution in under 4 minutes. Its computational efficiency, medium-range probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.

### LLaPipe: LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Automated Data   Preparation Pipeline Construction
**Authors**: Jing Chang, Chang Liu, Jinbin Huang, Rui Mao, Jianbin Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:52:19Z

**Summary**: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy (Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).

### Fast Graph Vector Search via Hardware Acceleration and   Delayed-Synchronization Traversal
**Authors**: Wenqi Jiang, Hang Hu, Torsten Hoefler, Gustavo Alonso

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:52:14Z

**Summary**: Vector search systems are indispensable in large language model (LLM) serving, search engines, and recommender systems, where minimizing online search latency is essential. Among various algorithms, graph-based vector search (GVS) is particularly popular due to its high search performance and quality. However, reducing GVS latency by intra-query parallelization remains challenging due to limitations imposed by both existing hardware architectures (CPUs and GPUs) and the inherent difficulty of parallelizing graph traversals. To efficiently serve low-latency GVS, we co-design hardware and algorithm by proposing Falcon and Delayed-Synchronization Traversal (DST). Falcon is a hardware GVS accelerator that implements efficient GVS operators, pipelines these operators, and reduces memory accesses by tracking search states with an on-chip Bloom filter. DST is an efficient graph traversal algorithm that simultaneously improves search performance and quality by relaxing traversal orders to maximize accelerator utilization. Evaluation across various graphs and datasets shows that Falcon, prototyped on FPGAs, together with DST, achieves up to 4.3x and 19.5x lower latency and up to 8.0x and 26.9x improvements in energy efficiency over CPU- and GPU-based GVS systems.

**Authors**: Retief Louw, Emma Sharratt, Febe de Wet, Christiaan Jacobs, Annelien Smith, Herman Kamper

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:49:41Z

**Summary**: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases, but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for children's learning.

### CogniQ-H: A Soft Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Paradigm for   Automated Data Preparation
**Authors**: Jing Chang, Chang Liu, Jinbin Huang, Rui Mao, Jianbin Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:43:22Z

**Summary**: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive, evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to 13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

### PosePilot: Steering Camera Pose for Generative World Models with   Self-supervised Depth
**Authors**: Bu Jin, Weize Li, Baihan Yang, Zhenxin Zhu, Junpeng Jiang, Huan-ang Gao, Haiyang Sun, Kun Zhan, Hengtong Hu, Xueyang Zhang, Peng Jia, Hao Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:43:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) systems have highlighted the potential of world models in achieving robust and generalizable performance across both ordinary and challenging driving conditions. However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.

### To Code or not to Code? Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language   Models via Expectation-Maximization
**Authors**: Haozhe Wang, Long Li, Chao Qu, Fengming Zhu, Weidi Xu, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:40:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.   While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

### LLM-driven Medical Report Generation via Communication-efficient   Heterogeneous Federated Learning
**Authors**: Haoxuan Che, Haibo Jin, Zhengrui Guo, Yi Lin, Cheng Jin, Hao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:39:50Z

**Summary**: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.

### CleanPose: Category-Level Object Pose Estimation via Causal Learning and   Knowledge Distillation
**Authors**: Xiao Lin, Yun Peng, Liuyi Wang, Xianyou Zhong, Minghao Zhu, Jingwei Yang, Yi Feng, Chengju Liu, Qijun Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:37:35Z

**Summary**: Category-level object pose estimation aims to recover the rotation, translation and size of unseen instances within predefined categories. In this task, deep neural network-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, previous studies show they suffer from spurious correlations raised by "unclean" confounders in models, hindering their performance on novel instances with significant variations. To address this issue, we propose CleanPose, a novel approach integrating causal learning and knowledge distillation to enhance category-level pose estimation. To mitigate the negative effect of unobserved confounders, we develop a causal inference module based on front-door adjustment, which promotes unbiased estimation by reducing potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to further improve generalization ability, we devise a residual-based knowledge distillation method that has proven effective in providing comprehensive category information guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks (REAL275, CAMERA25 and HouseCat6D) hightlight the superiority of proposed CleanPose over state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/chrislin0621/CleanPose.

### MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on   Continuous Modeling
**Authors**: Etienne Le Naour, Tahar Nabil, Ghislain Agoua

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:35:47Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.

### SafeAgent: Safeguarding LLM Agents via an Automated Risk Simulator
**Authors**: Xueyang Zhou, Weidong Wang, Lin Lu, Jiawen Shi, Guiyao Tie, Yongtian Xu, Lixing Chen, Pan Zhou, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:34:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.

 ### Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for Imbalanced Data -- An Empirical   Perspective
**Authors**: Pankaj Yadav, Vivek Vijay

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:50:51Z

**Summary**: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However, conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains. Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs. These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning, optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

### Harmony in Divergence: Towards Fast, Accurate, and Memory-efficient   Zeroth-order LLM Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Qitao Tan, Jun Liu, Zheng Zhan, Caiwei Ding, Yanzhi Wang, Xiaolong Ma, Jaewoo Lee, Jin Lu, Geng Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:50:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiZO-E86D.

### CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Jiwei Li, Chris Shum

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:43:56Z

**Summary**: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.   CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.   The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

### Automated Interpretation of Non-Destructive Evaluation Contour Maps   Using Large Language Models for Bridge Condition Assessment
**Authors**: Viraj Nishesh Darji, Callie C. Liao, Duoduo Liao

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:39:03Z

**Summary**: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

### Lessons from the TREC Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts   (PLABA) track
**Authors**: Brian Ondov, William Xia, Kush Attal, Ishita Unde, Jerry He, Hoa Dang, Ian Soboroff, Dina Demner-Fushman

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:23:52Z

**Summary**: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.   Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.   Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.   Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:21:27Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

### DPMT: Dual Process Multi-scale Theory of Mind Framework for Real-time   Human-AI Collaboration
**Authors**: Xiyun Li, Yining Ding, Yuhua Jiang, Yunlong Zhao, Runpeng Xie, Shuang Xu, Yuanhua Ni, Yiqin Yang, Bo Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:13:21Z

**Summary**: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM) module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

### Sparse Rewards Can Self-Train Dialogue Agents
**Authors**: Barrett Martin Lattimer, Varun Gangal, Ryan McDonald, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:06:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Model (LLM) agents, especially in multi-turn dialogue tasks, have been primarily driven by supervised fine-tuning and high-quality human feedback. However, as base LLM models continue to improve, acquiring meaningful human feedback has become increasingly challenging and costly. In certain domains, base LLM agents may eventually exceed human capabilities, making traditional feedback-driven methods impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-improvement paradigm that empowers LLM agents to autonomously enhance their performance without external human feedback. Our method, Juxtaposed Outcomes for Simulation Harvesting (JOSH), is a self-alignment algorithm that leverages a sparse reward simulation environment to extract ideal behaviors and further train the LLM on its own outputs. We present ToolWOZ, a sparse reward tool-calling simulation environment derived from MultiWOZ. We demonstrate that models trained with JOSH, both small and frontier, significantly improve tool-based interactions while preserving general model capabilities across diverse benchmarks.

### DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of   Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits
**Authors**: Garapati Keerthana, Manik Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T17:00:27Z

**Summary**: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.   We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.   We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.

### How Far Have Medical Vision-Language Models Come? A Comprehensive   Benchmarking Study
**Authors**: Che Liu, Jiazhen Pan, Weixiang Shen, Wenjia Bai, Daniel Rueckert, Rossella Arcucci

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:56:02Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs, ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert, OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third, performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation protocols.

**Summary**: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

### On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for   Multi-Programming Language Understanding
**Authors**: Haoyuan Wu, Rui Ming, Jilong Gao, Hangyu Zhao, Xueyi Chen, Yikai Yang, Haisheng Zheng, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:43:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.

**Authors**: Haiyuan Li, Hari Madhukumar, Peizheng Li, Yuelin Liu, Yiran Teng, Yulei Wu, Ning Wang, Shuangyi Yan, Dimitra Simeonidou

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:19:31Z

**Summary**: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

**Authors**: Sumanth Doddapaneni, Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan, Dilip Venkatesh, Raj Dabre, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Mitesh M. Khapra

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:14:51Z

**Summary**: Evaluating machine-generated text remains a significant challenge in NLP, especially for non-English languages. Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly available to enable further research in this important area.

### Evaluating the Effectiveness of Cost-Efficient Large Language Models in   Benchmark Biomedical Tasks
**Authors**: Israt Jahan, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Chun Peng, Jimmy Huang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:13:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better), with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

### Architecting Human-AI Cocreation for Technical Services -- Interaction   Modes and Contingency Factors
**Authors**: Jochen Wulf, Jurg Meierhofer, Frank Hannich

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:06:03Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), offer transformative potential for value co-creation in technical services. However, persistent challenges like hallucinations and operational brittleness limit their autonomous use, creating a critical need for robust frameworks to guide human-AI collaboration. Drawing on established Human-AI teaming research and analogies from fields like autonomous driving, this paper develops a structured taxonomy of human-agent interaction. Based on case study research within technical support platforms, we propose a six-mode taxonomy that organizes collaboration across a spectrum of AI autonomy. This spectrum is anchored by the Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL) model for full automation and the Human-Augmented Model (HAM) for passive AI assistance. Between these poles, the framework specifies four distinct intermediate structures. These include the Human-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human approval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows with deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation upon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables discretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key contingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system reliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a systematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human oversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the trade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of safer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems.

### KROMA: Ontology Matching with Knowledge Retrieval and Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Lam Nguyen, Erika Barcelos, Roger French, Yinghui Wu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T16:00:11Z

**Summary**: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.

### Equivalent and Compact Representations of Neural Network Controllers   With Decision Trees
**Authors**: Kevin Chang, Nathan Dahlin, Rahul Jain, Pierluigi Nuzzo

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:52:36Z

**Summary**: Over the past decade, neural network (NN)-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a variety of decision-making tasks. However, their black-box nature and the risk of unexpected behaviors pose a challenge to their deployment in real-world systems requiring strong guarantees of correctness and safety. We address these limitations by investigating the transformation of NN-based controllers into equivalent soft decision tree (SDT)-based controllers and its impact on verifiability. In contrast to existing work, we focus on discrete-output NN controllers including rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions as well as argmax operations. We then devise an exact yet efficient transformation algorithm which automatically prunes redundant branches. We first demonstrate the practical efficacy of the transformation algorithm applied to an autonomous driving NN controller within OpenAI Gym's CarRacing environment. Subsequently, we evaluate our approach using two benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym environment. Our results indicate that the SDT transformation can benefit formal verification, showing runtime improvements of up to $21 \times$ and $2 \times$ for MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v1, respectively.

### Efficient Temporal Tokenization for Mobility Prediction with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Haoyu He, Haozheng Luo, Yan Chen, Qi R. Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:31:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4% improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Photonic Fabric Platform for AI Accelerators
**Authors**: Jing Ding, Trung Diep

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T15:14:56Z

**Summary**: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM (PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA, without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and 1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of fixed memory to compute.

### Agentic Neural Networks: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Textual   Backpropagation
**Authors**: Xiaowen Ma, Chenyang Lin, Yao Zhang, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:52:19Z

**Summary**: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

### A Minimalist Controller for Autonomously Self-Aggregating Robotic   Swarms: Enabling Compact Formations in Multitasking Scenarios
**Authors**: Maria Eduarda Silva de Macedo, Ana Paula Chiarelli de Souza, Roberto Silvio Ubertino Rosso Jr., Yuri Kaszubowski Lopes

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:32:29Z

**Summary**: The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been well-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.

### DUALRec: A Hybrid Sequential and Language Model Framework for   Context-Aware Movie Recommendation
**Authors**: Yitong Li, Raoul Grasman

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:22:05Z

**Summary**: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec (Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

### Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
**Authors**: Yutao Jin, Haowen Xiao, Jielei Chu, Fengmao Lv, Yuxiao Li, Tianrui Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:21:24Z

**Summary**: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

### Exploiting Primacy Effect To Improve Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bianca Raimondi, Maurizio Gabbrielli

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:18:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.

### Device-Free Localization Using Commercial UWB Transceivers
**Authors**: Hyun Seok Lee

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:10:52Z

**Summary**: Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs. However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best performance with reasonable computational costs.

### DVFL-Net: A Lightweight Distilled Video Focal Modulation Network for   Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition
**Authors**: Hayat Ullah, Muhammad Ali Shafique, Abbas Khan, Arslan Munir

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:10:43Z

**Summary**: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.

**Authors**: Jan Trienes, Anastasiia Derzhanskaia, Roland Schwarzkopf, Markus Mühling, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:09:45Z

**Summary**: We present Marcel, a lightweight and open-source conversational agent designed to support prospective students with admission-related inquiries. The system aims to provide fast and personalized responses, while reducing workload of university staff. We employ retrieval-augmented generation to ground answers in university resources and to provide users with verifiable, contextually relevant information. To improve retrieval quality, we introduce an FAQ retriever that maps user questions to knowledge-base entries, allowing administrators to steer retrieval, and improving over standard dense/hybrid retrieval strategies. The system is engineered for easy deployment in resource-constrained academic settings. We detail the system architecture, provide a technical evaluation of its components, and report insights from a real-world deployment.

### Preprint: Did I Just Browse A Website Written by LLMs?
**Authors**: Sichang "Steven" He, Ramesh Govindan, Harsha V. Madhyastha

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T14:09:04Z

**Summary**: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient, because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content has complex markup and diverse genres.   We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web ecosystem.

### The Levers of Political Persuasion with Conversational AI
**Authors**: Kobi Hackenburg, Ben M. Tappin, Luke Hewitt, Ed Saunders, Sid Black, Hause Lin, Catherine Fist, Helen Margetts, David G. Rand, Christopher Summerfield

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:50:09Z

**Summary**: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims. Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27% respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly, where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased factual accuracy.

### Generalization in Reinforcement Learning for Radio Access Networks
**Authors**: Burak Demirel, Yu Wang, Cristian Tatino, Pablo Soldati

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:46:26Z

**Summary**: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges. Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) robustly reconstructs dynamically varying states from partial and noisy observations, while encoding static and semi-static information, such as radio nodes, cell attributes, and their topology, through graph representations; (ii) applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii) distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five 5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks, respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture, offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

### LOCUS: LOcalization with Channel Uncertainty and Sporadic Energy
**Authors**: Subrata Biswas, Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan, Violet Colwell, Jack Adiletta, Bashima Islam

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:42:41Z

**Summary**: Accurate sound source localization (SSL), such as direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, relies on consistent multichannel data. However, batteryless systems often suffer from missing data due to the stochastic nature of energy harvesting, degrading localization performance. We propose LOCUS, a deep learning framework that recovers corrupted features in such settings. LOCUS integrates three modules: (1) Information-Weighted Focus (InFo) to identify corrupted regions, (2) Latent Feature Synthesizer (LaFS) to reconstruct missing features, and (3) Guided Replacement (GRep) to restore data without altering valid inputs. LOCUS significantly improves DoA accuracy under missing-channel conditions, achieving up to 36.91% error reduction on DCASE and LargeSet, and 25.87-59.46% gains in real-world deployments. We release a 50-hour multichannel dataset to support future research on localization under energy constraints. Our code and data are available at: https://bashlab.github.io/locus_project/

### Application Placement with Constraint Relaxation
**Authors**: Damiano Azzolini, Marco Duca, Stefano Forti, Francesco Gallo, Antonio Ielo

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T13:20:58Z

**Summary**: Novel utility computing paradigms rely upon the deployment of multi-service applications to pervasive and highly distributed cloud-edge infrastructure resources. Deciding onto which computational nodes to place services in cloud-edge networks, as per their functional and non-functional constraints, can be formulated as a combinatorial optimisation problem. Most existing solutions in this space are not able to deal with \emph{unsatisfiable} problem instances, nor preferences, i.e. requirements that DevOps may agree to relax to obtain a solution. In this article, we exploit Answer Set Programming optimisation capabilities to tackle this problem. Experimental results in simulated settings show that our approach is effective on lifelike networks and applications.

### Using LLMs to identify features of personal and professional skills in   an open-response situational judgment test
**Authors**: Cole Walsh, Rodica Ivan, Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Colleen Robb

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:59:17Z

**Summary**: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

### Large Language Models as Innovators: A Framework to Leverage Latent   Space Exploration for Novelty Discovery
**Authors**: Mateusz Bystroński, Mikołaj Hołysz, Grzegorz Piotrowski, Nitesh V. Chawla, Tomasz Kajdanowicz

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:54:28Z

**Summary**: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.

**Authors**: Konstantin Donhauser, Kristina Ulicna, Gemma Elyse Moran, Aditya Ravuri, Kian Kenyon-Dean, Cian Eastwood, Jason Hartford

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:37:43Z

**Summary**: Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract semantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models (LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.

### HoH: A Dynamic Benchmark for Evaluating the Impact of Outdated   Information on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jie Ouyang, Tingyue Pan, Mingyue Cheng, Ruiran Yan, Yucong Luo, Jiaying Lin, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:34:45Z

**Summary**: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/0russwest0/HoH.

### SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data   Memorization and Knowledge Injection
**Authors**: Aleksandr Gashkov, Aleksandr Perevalov, Maria Eltsova, Andreas Both

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:28:08Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems, generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf. LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM, s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is possible.

### InTraVisTo: Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool
**Authors**: Nicolò Brunello, Davide Rigamonti, Andrea Sassella, Vincenzo Scotti, Mark James Carman

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:23:47Z

**Summary**: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity. Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool, InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram). With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

### Bias in Decision-Making for AI's Ethical Dilemmas: A Comparative Study   of ChatGPT and Claude
**Authors**: Yile Yan, Yuqi Zhu, Wentao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T12:09:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study investigates protected attributes in LLMs through systematic evaluation of their responses to ethical dilemmas. Using two prominent models - GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet - we analyzed their decision-making patterns across multiple protected attributes including age, gender, race, appearance, and disability status. Through 11,200 experimental trials involving both single-factor and two-factor protected attribute combinations, we evaluated the models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering of preferences. Our findings reveal significant protected attributeses in both models, with consistent preferences for certain features (e.g., "good-looking") and systematic neglect of others. Notably, while GPT-3.5 Turbo showed stronger preferences aligned with traditional power structures, Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated more diverse protected attribute choices. We also found that ethical sensitivity significantly decreases in more complex scenarios involving multiple protected attributes. Additionally, linguistic referents heavily influence the models' ethical evaluations, as demonstrated by differing responses to racial descriptors (e.g., "Yellow" versus "Asian"). These findings highlight critical concerns about the potential impact of LLM biases in autonomous decision-making systems and emphasize the need for careful consideration of protected attributes in AI development. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on AI ethics by providing a systematic framework for evaluating protected attributes in LLMs' ethical decision-making capabilities.

### Modeling Fair Play in Detective Stories with Language Models
**Authors**: Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:55:18Z

**Summary**: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story, and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right. Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which greatly contributes to their poor quality.

### DistFlow: A Fully Distributed RL Framework for Scalable and Efficient   LLM Post-Training
**Authors**: Zhixin Wang, Tianyi Zhou, Liming Liu, Ao Li, Jiarui Hu, Dian Yang, Jinlong Hou, Siyuan Feng, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Qi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:41:49Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the pivotal post-training technique for large language model. Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe, goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.

**Summary**: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.

### Visual Grounding Methods for Efficient Interaction with Desktop   Graphical User Interfaces
**Authors**: El Hassane Ettifouri, Jessica López Espejel, Laura Minkova, Tassnim Dardouri, Walid Dahhane

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:35:01Z

**Summary**: Most visual grounding solutions primarily focus on realistic images. However, applications involving synthetic images, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), remain limited. This restricts the development of autonomous computer vision-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents for automatic application interaction. Enabling AI to effectively understand and interact with GUIs is crucial to advancing automation in software testing, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we explore Instruction Visual Grounding (IVG), a multi-modal approach to object identification within a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and a GUI screen, IVG locates the coordinates of the element on the screen where the instruction should be executed. We propose two main methods: (1) IVGocr, which combines a Large Language Model (LLM), an object detection model, and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module; and (2) IVGdirect, which uses a multimodal architecture for end-to-end grounding. For each method, we introduce a dedicated dataset. In addition, we propose the Central Point Validation (CPV) metric, a relaxed variant of the classical Central Proximity Score (CPS) metric. Our final test dataset is publicly released to support future research.

### Question-Answer Extraction from Scientific Articles Using Knowledge   Graphs and Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hosein Azarbonyad, Zi Long Zhu, Georgios Cheirmpos, Zubair Afzal, Vikrant Yadav, Georgios Tsatsaronis

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:31:52Z

**Summary**: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research, scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

### RAG-based Architectures for Drug Side Effect Retrieval in LLMs
**Authors**: Shad Nygren, Pinar Avci, Andre Daniels, Reza Rassol, Afshin Beheshti, Diego Galeano

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:20:52Z

**Summary**: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval.

**Authors**: Jun Xie, Zhaoran Zhao, Xiongjun Guan, Yingjian Zhu, Hongzhu Yi, Xinming Wang, Feng Chen, Zhepeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:12:44Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs) via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways. An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator, selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for future Video-LMM development.

**Authors**: Dawar Khan, Xinyu Liu, Omar Mena, Donggang Jia, Alexandre Kouyoumdjian, Ivan Viola

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T11:10:07Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present AIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running on XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across four XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified evaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based setups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our findings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

### DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Tamim Al Mahmud, Najeeb Jebreel, Josep Domingo-Ferrer, David Sanchez

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:56:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

### Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language   Models on Social Media
**Authors**: Wenlu Fan, Yuqi Zhu, Chenyang Wang, Bin Wang, Wentao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:53:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.

### CodeEdu: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Platform for Personalized Coding   Education
**Authors**: Jianing Zhao, Peng Gao, Jiannong Cao, Zhiyuan Wen, Chen Chen, Jianing Yin, Ruosong Yang, Bo Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:52:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in improving coding education by providing support for code writing, explanation, and debugging. However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess students' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material aligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning. Current work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to understand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent research has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated problems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in the field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu, an innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool use to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static pipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student needs. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically, including task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA, step-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report generation, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task efficiency. Automated evaluations reveal that CodeEdu substantially enhances students' coding performance.

### GeoPF: Infusing Geometry into Potential Fields for Reactive Planning in   Non-trivial Environments
**Authors**: Yuhe Gong, Riddhiman Laha, Luis Figueredo

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:36:52Z

**Summary**: Reactive intelligence remains one of the cornerstones of versatile robotics operating in cluttered, dynamic, and human-centred environments. Among reactive approaches, potential fields (PF) continue to be widely adopted due to their simplicity and real-time applicability. However, existing PF methods typically oversimplify environmental representations by relying on isotropic, point- or sphere-based obstacle approximations. In human-centred settings, this simplification results in overly conservative paths, cumbersome tuning, and computational overhead -- even breaking real-time requirements. In response, we propose the Geometric Potential Field (GeoPF), a reactive motion-planning framework that explicitly infuses geometric primitives -- points, lines, planes, cubes, and cylinders -- their structure and spatial relationship in modulating the real-time repulsive response. Extensive quantitative analyses consistently show GeoPF's higher success rates, reduced tuning complexity (a single parameter set across experiments), and substantially lower computational costs (up to 2 orders of magnitude) compared to traditional PF methods. Real-world experiments further validate GeoPF reliability, robustness, and practical ease of deployment, as well as its scalability to whole-body avoidance. GeoPF provides a fresh perspective on reactive planning problems driving geometric-aware temporal motion generation, enabling flexible and low-latency motion planning suitable for modern robotic applications.

### GRAM-MAMBA: Holistic Feature Alignment for Wireless Perception with   Adaptive Low-Rank Compensation
**Authors**: Weiqi Yang, Xu Zhou, Jingfu Guan, Hao Du, Tianyu Bai

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:30:37Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments, unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing, combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA), outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in resource-constrained environments.

**Authors**: Wannita Takerngsaksiri, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn, Micheal Fu, Jirat Pasuksmit, Kun Chen, Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T10:09:05Z

**Summary**: Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process, especially in the age of large language models (LLMs) that can automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.

### ExtracTable: Human-in-the-Loop Transformation of Scientific Corpora into   Structured Knowledge
**Authors**: Lena John, Ahmed Malek Ghanmi, Tim Wittenborg, Sören Auer, Oliver Karras

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:35:18Z

**Summary**: As the volume of scientific literature grows, efficient knowledge organization becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional approaches to structuring scientific content are time-consuming and require significant domain expertise, highlighting the need for tool support. We present ExtracTable, a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow and framework that assists researchers in transforming unstructured publications into structured representations. The workflow combines large language models (LLMs) with user-defined schemas and is designed for downstream integration into knowledge graphs (KGs). Developed and evaluated in the context of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), ExtracTable automates key steps such as document preprocessing and data extraction while ensuring user oversight through validation. In an evaluation with ORKG community participants following the Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP), ExtracTable demonstrated high usability and practical value. Participants gave it an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84.17 (A+, the highest rating). The time to progress from a research interest to literature-based insights was reduced from between 4 hours and 2 weeks to an average of 24:40 minutes. By streamlining corpus creation and structured data extraction for knowledge graph integration, ExtracTable leverages LLMs and user models to accelerate literature reviews. However, human validation remains essential to ensure quality, and future work will address improving extraction accuracy and entity linking to existing knowledge resources.

**Authors**: Seokhee Hong, Sunkyoung Kim, Guijin Son, Soyeon Kim, Yeonjung Hong, Jinsik Lee

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:31:19Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires robust benchmarks that encompass not only academic domains but also industrial fields to effectively evaluate their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce two Korean expert-level benchmarks. KMMLU-Redux, reconstructed from the existing KMMLU, consists of questions from the Korean National Technical Qualification exams, with critical errors removed to enhance reliability. KMMLU-Pro is based on Korean National Professional Licensure exams to reflect professional knowledge in Korea. Our experiments demonstrate that these benchmarks comprehensively represent industrial knowledge in Korea. We release our dataset publicly available.

### SIC: Similarity-Based Interpretable Image Classification with Neural   Networks
**Authors**: Tom Nuno Wolf, Emre Kavak, Fabian Bongratz, Christian Wachinger

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:12:08Z

**Summary**: The deployment of deep learning models in critical domains necessitates a balance between high accuracy and interpretability. We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.

### The Emperor's New Chain-of-Thought: Probing Reasoning Theater Bias in   Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Yubo Fan, Zhenheng Tang, Nuo Chen, Wenxuan Wang, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T09:06:10Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and o1 are increasingly used as automated evaluators, raising critical questions about their vulnerability to the aesthetics of reasoning in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We introduce THEATER, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate this vulnerability-termed Reasoning Theater Bias (RTB)-by comparing LLMs and LRMs across subjective preference and objective factual datasets. Through investigation of six bias types including Simple Cues and Fake Chain-of-Thought, we uncover three key findings: (1) in a critical paradox, reasoning-specialized LRMs are consistently more susceptible to RTB than general-purpose LLMs, particularly in subjective tasks; (2) this creates a task-dependent trade-off, where LRMs show more robustness on factual tasks but less on subjective ones; and (3) we identify 'shallow reasoning'-plausible but flawed arguments-as the most potent form of RTB. To address this, we design and evaluate two prompting strategies: a targeted system prompt that improves accuracy by up to 12% on factual tasks but only 1-3% on subjective tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that shows similarly limited effectiveness in the more vulnerable subjective domains. Our work reveals that RTB is a deep-seated challenge for LRM-based evaluation and provides a systematic framework for developing more genuinely robust and trustworthy LRMs.

**Summary**: Optical time-frequency transfer establishes the metrological linkage in large-scale clock networks, which facilitates various applications. Fiber-based transfer benefits from the abundant deployment of fiber infrastructures to achieve this advantage. In this Review, we provide an overview of the advances in optical two-way time-frequency transfer, which began with characterizing the time-frequency transfer stability. Then, we discuss the system configuration, key modules, main challenges, and mainstream transfer methods.

### PRIDE -- Parameter-Efficient Reduction of Identity Discrimination for   Equality in LLMs
**Authors**: Maluna Menke, Thilo Hagendorff

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:44:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of 100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1% additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%. Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements. These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT, the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

### From Words to Collisions: LLM-Guided Evaluation and Adversarial   Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios
**Authors**: Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Korbinian Moller, Amr Alanwar, Johannes Betz

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:39:33Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.

### DailyLLM: Context-Aware Activity Log Generation Using Multi-Modal   Sensors and LLMs
**Authors**: Ye Tian, Xiaoyuan Ren, Zihao Wang, Onat Gungor, Xiaofan Yu, Tajana Rosing

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:33:30Z

**Summary**: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing. The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.

### The Judge Variable: Challenging Judge-Agnostic Legal Judgment Prediction
**Authors**: Guillaume Zambrano

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:28:53Z

**Summary**: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made available.

### AGENTS-LLM: Augmentative GENeration of Challenging Traffic Scenarios   with an Agentic LLM Framework
**Authors**: Yu Yao, Salil Bhatnagar, Markus Mazzola, Vasileios Belagiannis, Igor Gilitschenski, Luigi Palmieri, Simon Razniewski, Marcel Hallgarten

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T08:20:16Z

**Summary**: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.

**Summary**: Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design. The goal is to offer a structured and comprehensive reference for advancing secure blockchain systems in the quantum era.

### LLaPipe: LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Automated Data   Preparation Pipeline Construction
**Authors**: Jing Chang, Chang Liu, Jinbin Huang, Rui Mao, Jianbin Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:52:19Z

**Summary**: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy (Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).

### Fast Graph Vector Search via Hardware Acceleration and   Delayed-Synchronization Traversal
**Authors**: Wenqi Jiang, Hang Hu, Torsten Hoefler, Gustavo Alonso

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:52:14Z

**Summary**: Vector search systems are indispensable in large language model (LLM) serving, search engines, and recommender systems, where minimizing online search latency is essential. Among various algorithms, graph-based vector search (GVS) is particularly popular due to its high search performance and quality. However, reducing GVS latency by intra-query parallelization remains challenging due to limitations imposed by both existing hardware architectures (CPUs and GPUs) and the inherent difficulty of parallelizing graph traversals. To efficiently serve low-latency GVS, we co-design hardware and algorithm by proposing Falcon and Delayed-Synchronization Traversal (DST). Falcon is a hardware GVS accelerator that implements efficient GVS operators, pipelines these operators, and reduces memory accesses by tracking search states with an on-chip Bloom filter. DST is an efficient graph traversal algorithm that simultaneously improves search performance and quality by relaxing traversal orders to maximize accelerator utilization. Evaluation across various graphs and datasets shows that Falcon, prototyped on FPGAs, together with DST, achieves up to 4.3x and 19.5x lower latency and up to 8.0x and 26.9x improvements in energy efficiency over CPU- and GPU-based GVS systems.

**Authors**: Retief Louw, Emma Sharratt, Febe de Wet, Christiaan Jacobs, Annelien Smith, Herman Kamper

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:49:41Z

**Summary**: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases, but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for children's learning.

### CogniQ-H: A Soft Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Paradigm for   Automated Data Preparation
**Authors**: Jing Chang, Chang Liu, Jinbin Huang, Rui Mao, Jianbin Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:43:22Z

**Summary**: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive, evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to 13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

### To Code or not to Code? Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language   Models via Expectation-Maximization
**Authors**: Haozhe Wang, Long Li, Chao Qu, Fengming Zhu, Weidi Xu, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:40:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.   While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

### LLM-driven Medical Report Generation via Communication-efficient   Heterogeneous Federated Learning
**Authors**: Haoxuan Che, Haibo Jin, Zhengrui Guo, Yi Lin, Cheng Jin, Hao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:39:50Z

**Summary**: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.

### Mitigating Goal Misgeneralization via Minimax Regret
**Authors**: Karim Abdel Sadek, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Usman Anwar, Hannah Erlebach, Christian Schroeder de Witt, David Krueger, Michael Dennis

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:38:55Z

**Summary**: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER) objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to mitigating goal misgeneralization.

### SafeAgent: Safeguarding LLM Agents via an Automated Risk Simulator
**Authors**: Xueyang Zhou, Weidong Wang, Lin Lu, Jiawen Shi, Guiyao Tie, Yongtian Xu, Lixing Chen, Pan Zhou, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:34:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.

### ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of   RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems
**Authors**: Mohita Chowdhury, Yajie Vera He, Jared Joselowitz, Aisling Higham, Ernest Lim

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:31:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.

### Consistent Explainers or Unreliable Narrators? Understanding   LLM-generated Group Recommendations
**Authors**: Cedric Waterschoot, Nava Tintarev, Francesco Barile

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T07:20:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS). In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations. Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes. Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

### TopicAttack: An Indirect Prompt Injection Attack via Topic Transition
**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Yuexin Li, Yue Liu, Yangqiu Song, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T06:23:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a range of NLP tasks. However, their strong instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish instructions from data content make them vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks. In such attacks, instructions with malicious purposes are injected into external data sources, such as web documents. When LLMs retrieve this injected data through tools, such as a search engine and execute the injected instructions, they provide misled responses. Recent attack methods have demonstrated potential, but their abrupt instruction injection often undermines their effectiveness. Motivated by the limitations of existing attack methods, we propose TopicAttack, which prompts the LLM to generate a fabricated conversational transition prompt that gradually shifts the topic toward the injected instruction, making the injection smoother and enhancing the plausibility and success of the attack. Through comprehensive experiments, TopicAttack achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an attack success rate (ASR) over 90\% in most cases, even when various defense methods are applied. We further analyze its effectiveness by examining attention scores. We find that a higher injected-to-original attention ratio leads to a greater success probability, and our method achieves a much higher ratio than the baseline methods.

### FireQ: Fast INT4-FP8 Kernel and RoPE-aware Quantization for LLM   Inference Acceleration
**Authors**: Daehyeon Baek, Jieun Choi, Jimyoung Son, Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Hyojung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T06:15:50Z

**Summary**: As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

### LoopServe: An Adaptive Dual-phase LLM Inference Acceleration System for   Multi-Turn Dialogues
**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Zhanchao Xu, Yiming Li, Xuejia Chen, Darian Li, Anxin Tian, Qingfa Xiao, Cheng Deng, Jun Wang, Qing Li, Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T06:12:08Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

### HeCoFuse: Cross-Modal Complementary V2X Cooperative Perception with   Heterogeneous Sensors
**Authors**: Chuheng Wei, Ziye Qin, Walter Zimmer, Guoyuan Wu, Matthew J. Barth

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T06:02:22Z

**Summary**: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras (C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22% 3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust performance across diverse sensor deployments.

### Can Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks Be Detected and Removed?
**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Yuan Sui, Yufei He, Yue Liu, Yangqiu Song, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T05:48:55Z

**Summary**: Prompt injection attacks manipulate large language models (LLMs) by misleading them to deviate from the original input instructions and execute maliciously injected instructions, because of their instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between the original input instructions and maliciously injected instructions. To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we restrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than direct defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while there are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and open-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our crafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1) the segmentation removal method, which segments the injected document and removes parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the extraction removal method, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected instructions.

### Defense Against Prompt Injection Attack by Leveraging Attack Techniques
**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Zihao Zheng, Yangqiu Song, Dekai Wu, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T05:44:32Z

**Summary**: With the advancement of technology, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, powering LLM-integrated applications like Microsoft Copilot. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, new vulnerabilities, especially prompt injection attacks arise. These attacks trick LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing the attacker's instructions injected in data content, such as retrieved results. Recent attack methods leverage LLMs' instruction-following abilities and their inabilities to distinguish instructions injected in the data content, and achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). When comparing the attack and defense methods, we interestingly find that they share similar design goals, of inducing the model to ignore unwanted instructions and instead to execute wanted instructions. Therefore, we raise an intuitive question: Could these attack techniques be utilized for defensive purposes? In this paper, we invert the intention of prompt injection methods to develop novel defense methods based on previous training-free attack methods, by repeating the attack process but with the original input instruction rather than the injected instruction. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense techniques outperform existing training-free defense approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### KiC: Keyword-inspired Cascade for Cost-Efficient Text Generation with   LLMs
**Authors**: Woo-Chan Kim, Ji-Hoon Park, Seong-Whan Lee

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T05:34:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary. Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model. Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81 percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

### Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates for AI-Based Systems
**Authors**: Asma Yamani, Malak Baslyman, Moataz Ahmed

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T05:24:57Z

**Summary**: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

### Global Modeling Matters: A Fast, Lightweight and Effective Baseline for   Efficient Image Restoration
**Authors**: Xingyu Jiang, Ning Gao, Hongkun Dou, Xiuhui Zhang, Xiaoqing Zhong, Yue Deng, Hongjue Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T05:15:04Z

**Summary**: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions, significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet). Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T05:02:11Z

**Summary**: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents marks a significant shift in the research landscape by offering cognitive abilities that are competitive with human planning and reasoning. This paper explores the transformative potential of integrating Large Language Models into Multi-Agent (LMA) systems for addressing complex challenges in software engineering (SE). By leveraging the collaborative and specialized abilities of multiple agents, LMA systems enable autonomous problem-solving, improve robustness, and provide scalable solutions for managing the complexity of real-world software projects. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of recent primary studies to map the current landscape of LMA applications across various stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). To illustrate current capabilities and limitations, we perform two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art LMA frameworks. Additionally, we identify critical research gaps and propose a comprehensive research agenda focused on enhancing individual agent capabilities and optimizing agent synergy. Our work outlines a forward-looking vision for developing fully autonomous, scalable, and trustworthy LMA systems, laying the foundation for the evolution of Software Engineering 2.0.

### The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of   Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity
**Authors**: Parshin Shojaee, Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh, Maxwell Horton, Samy Bengio, Mehrdad Farajtabar

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T04:14:22Z

**Summary**: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

**Authors**: Niveen O. Jaffal, Mohammed Alkhanafseh, David Mohaisen

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T03:41:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming cybersecurity by enabling intelligent, adaptive, and automated approaches to threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. With their advanced language understanding and contextual reasoning, LLMs surpass traditional methods in tackling challenges across domains such as IoT, blockchain, and hardware security. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM applications in cybersecurity, focusing on two core areas: (1) the integration of LLMs into key cybersecurity domains, and (2) the vulnerabilities of LLMs themselves, along with mitigation strategies. By synthesizing recent advancements and identifying key limitations, this work offers practical insights and strategic recommendations for leveraging LLMs to build secure, scalable, and future-ready cyber defense systems.

### BifrostRAG: Bridging Dual Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question   Answering in Construction Safety
**Authors**: Yuxin Zhang, Xi Wang, Mo Hu, Zhenyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T03:39:14Z

**Summary**: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure (via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1 score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

### EvolveNav: Self-Improving Embodied Reasoning for LLM-Based   Vision-Language Navigation
**Authors**: Bingqian Lin, Yunshuang Nie, Khun Loun Zai, Ziming Wei, Mingfei Han, Rongtao Xu, Minzhe Niu, Jianhua Han, Liang Lin, Cewu Lu, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T03:23:12Z

**Summary**: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T03:19:43Z

**Summary**: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

### TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human   Action Prediction
**Authors**: Kojiro Takeyama, Yimeng Liu, Misha Sra

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T03:17:05Z

**Summary**: Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.

### Temporal reasoning for timeline summarisation in social media
**Authors**: Jiayu Song, Mahmud Elahi Akhter, Dana Atzil Slonim, Maria Liakata

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T03:12:59Z

**Summary**: This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarisation, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, such as social media threads. We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.

### From Firms to Computation: AI Governance and the Evolution of   Institutions
**Authors**: Michael S. Harre

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T02:52:58Z

**Summary**: The integration of agential artificial intelligence into socioeconomic systems requires us to reexamine the evolutionary processes that describe changes in our economic institutions. This article synthesizes three frameworks: multi-level selection theory, Aoki's view of firms as computational processes, and Ostrom's design principles for robust institutions. We develop a framework where selection operates concurrently across organizational levels, firms implement distributed inference via game-theoretic architectures, and Ostrom-style rules evolve as alignment mechanisms that address AI-related risks. This synthesis yields a multi-level Price equation expressed over nested games, providing quantitative metrics for how selection and governance co-determine economic outcomes. We examine connections to Acemoglu's work on inclusive institutions, analyze how institutional structures shape AI deployment, and demonstrate the framework's explanatory power via case studies. We conclude by proposing a set of design principles that operationalize alignment between humans and AI across institutional layers, enabling scalable, adaptive, and inclusive governance of agential AI systems. We conclude with practical policy recommendations and further research to extend these principles into real-world implementation.

### Linguistic and Embedding-Based Profiling of Texts generated by Humans   and Large Language Models
**Authors**: Sergio E. Zanotto, Segun Aroyehun

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T02:46:55Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.

### Dynamic Transmission Line Switching Amidst Wildfire-Prone Weather Under   Decision-Dependent Uncertainty
**Authors**: Juan-Alberto Estrada-Garcia, Ruiwei Jiang, Alexandre Moreira

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T02:41:17Z

**Summary**: During dry and windy seasons, environmental conditions significantly increase the risk of wildfires, exposing power grids to disruptions caused by transmission line failures. Wildfire propagation exacerbates grid vulnerability, potentially leading to prolonged power outages. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-stage optimization model that dynamically adjusts transmission grid topology in response to wildfire propagation, aiming to develop an optimal response policy. By accounting for decision-dependent uncertainty, where line survival probabilities depend on usage, we employ distributionally robust optimization to model uncertainty in line survival distributions. We adapt the stochastic nested decomposition algorithm and derive a deterministic upper bound for its finite convergence. To enhance computational efficiency, we exploit the Lagrangian dual problem structure for a faster generation of Lagrangian cuts. Using realistic data from the California transmission grid, we demonstrate the superior performance of dynamic response policies against two-stage alternatives through a comprehensive case study. In addition, we construct easy-to-implement policies that significantly reduce computational burden while maintaining good performance in real-time deployment.

### Reasoning about Uncertainty: Do Reasoning Models Know When They Don't   Know?
**Authors**: Zhiting Mei, Christina Zhang, Tenny Yin, Justin Lidard, Ola Shorinwa, Anirudha Majumdar

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T02:39:29Z

**Summary**: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

**Authors**: Ian R. McKenzie, Oskar J. Hollinsworth, Tom Tseng, Xander Davies, Stephen Casper, Aaron D. Tucker, Robert Kirk, Adam Gleave

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T01:26:48Z

**Summary**: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

### ParaStudent: Generating and Evaluating Realistic Student Code by   Teaching LLMs to Struggle
**Authors**: Mihran Miroyan, Rose Niousha, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Gireeja Ranade, Narges Norouzi

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T01:02:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect, iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns, incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at https://github.com/mmiroyan/ParaStudent.

### FuSeFL: Fully Secure and Scalable Cross-Silo Federated Learning
**Authors**: Sahar Ghoflsaz Ghinani, Elaheh Sadredini

**Updated**: 2025-07-18T00:50:44Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains. While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving large datasets and strict compliance requirements.   We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to 95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and efficiency at scale.
