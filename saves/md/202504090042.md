 ### State Tuning: State-based Test-Time Scaling on RWKV-7
**Authors**: Liu Xiao, Li Zhiyuan, Lin Yueyu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:04:30Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling has emerged as a prominent research direction in machine learning, enabling models to enhance their expressive capabilities during inference.Transformers, renowned for striking a delicate balance between efficiency and expressiveness, have benefited from test-time scaling techniques that leverage an expanding key-value (KV) cache to significantly improve performance.In this paper, we introduce a novel state-based approach to test-time scaling, which we term state tuning, tailored to the RNN-based RWKV-7 model.By exploiting the unique strengths of RWKV-7, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the target task without altering the model's pre-trained weights. Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we develop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and learn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method to dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and expressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller model can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the efficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of test-time scaling to deliver superior results. Our findings underscore the potential of state tuning as an effective strategy for advancing model performance in resource-constrained settings.

**Authors**: Ruikang Liu, Yuxuan Sun, Manyi Zhang, Haoli Bai, Xianzhi Yu, Tiezheng Yu, Chun Yuan, Lu Hou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:22:45Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this study, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, and QwQ-32B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes will be open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.

### Semantic Parsing with Candidate Expressions for Knowledge Base Question   Answering
**Authors**: Daehwan Nam, Gary Geunbae Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:27:48Z

**Summary**: Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also introduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask caching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching algorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We experimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. In addition, our semantic parser had a fast decoding speed in the experiments.

### LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are   Important
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, JiaMing Zhang, Xiong Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T03:22:15Z

**Summary**: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV}.

### FastVAR: Linear Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Cached Token Pruning
**Authors**: Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Taolin Zhang, Jiangshan Wang, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T01:35:39Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.

### Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yao Tao, Yehui Tang, Yun Wang, Mingjian Zhu, Hailin Hu, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-06T15:15:07Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

### ZSMerge: Zero-Shot KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient   Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Liu, Pei Liu, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-06T12:20:25Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZSMerge.

### Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2025-04-05T12:37:19Z

**Summary**: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

### Learning Cache Coherence Traffic for NoC Routing Design
**Authors**: Guochu Xiong, Xiangzhong Luo, Weichen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-05T00:59:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of multi-core systems highlights the need for efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC) design to ensure seamless communication. Cache coherence, essential for data consistency, substantially reduces task computation time by enabling data sharing among caches. As a result, routing serves two roles: facilitating data sharing (influenced by topology) and managing NoC-level communication. However, cache coherence is often overlooked in routing, causing mismatches between design expectations and evaluation outcomes. Two main challenges are the lack of specialized tools to assess cache coherence's impact and the neglect of topology selection in routing. In this work, we propose a cache coherence-aware routing approach with integrated topology selection, guided by our Cache Coherence Traffic Analyzer (CCTA). Our method achieves up to 10.52% lower packet latency, 55.51% faster execution time, and 49.02% total energy savings, underscoring the critical role of cache coherence in NoC design and enabling effective co-design.

**Authors**: Huda Ibeid, Vikram Narayana, Jeongnim Kim, Anthony Nguyen, Vitali Morozov, Ye Luo

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T17:56:44Z

**Summary**: The Aurora supercomputer is an exascale-class system designed to tackle some of the most demanding computational workloads. Equipped with both High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR memory, it provides unique trade-offs in performance, latency, and capacity. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the memory systems on the Aurora supercomputer, with a focus on evaluating the trade-offs between HBM and DDR memory systems. We explore how different memory configurations, including memory modes (Flat and Cache) and clustering modes (Quad and SNC4), influence key system performance metrics such as memory bandwidth, latency, CPU-GPU PCIe bandwidth, and MPI communication bandwidth. Additionally, we examine the performance of three representative HPC applications -- HACC, QMCPACK, and BFS -- each illustrating the impact of memory configurations on performance. By using microbenchmarks and application-level analysis, we provide insights into how to select the optimal memory system and configuration to maximize performance based on the application characteristics. The findings presented in this paper offer guidance for users of the Aurora system and similar exascale systems.

### Adaptive Semantic Prompt Caching with VectorQ
**Authors**: Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Shu Liu, Alejandro Cuadron, Mark Zhao, Stephan Krusche, Alfons Kemper, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T16:51:15Z

**Summary**: Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different embeddings. We propose VectorQ, an online framework with a threshold convergence guarantee to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of three diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 26x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 74%.

**Authors**: Abdalaziz Rashid Al-Maeeni, Aziz Temirkhanov, Artem Ryzhikov, Mikhail Hushchyn

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T15:30:20Z

**Summary**: High-precision modeling of systems is one of the main areas of industrial data analysis. Models of systems, their digital twins, are used to predict their behavior under various conditions. We have developed several models of a storage system using machine learning-based generative models. The system consists of several components: hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) storage pools with different RAID schemes and cache. Each storage component is represented by a probabilistic model that describes the probability distribution of the component performance in terms of IOPS and latency, depending on their configuration and external data load parameters. The results of the experiments demonstrate the errors of 4-10 % for IOPS and 3-16 % for latency predictions depending on the components and models of the system. The predictions show up to 0.99 Pearson correlation with Little's law, which can be used for unsupervised reliability checks of the models. In addition, we present novel data sets that can be used for benchmarking regression algorithms, conditional generative models, and uncertainty estimation methods in machine learning.

### Optimistic Learning for Communication Networks
**Authors**: George Iosifidis, Naram Mhaisen, Douglas J. Leith

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T14:55:27Z

**Summary**: AI/ML-based tools are at the forefront of resource management solutions for communication networks. Deep learning, in particular, is highly effective in facilitating fast and high-performing decision-making whenever representative training data is available to build offline accurate models. Conversely, online learning solutions do not require training and enable adaptive decisions based on runtime observations, alas are often overly conservative. This extensive tutorial proposes the use of optimistic learning (OpL) as a decision engine for resource management frameworks in modern communication systems. When properly designed, such solutions can achieve fast and high-performing decisions -- comparable to offline-trained models -- while preserving the robustness and performance guarantees of the respective online learning approaches. We introduce the fundamental concepts, algorithms and results of OpL, discuss the roots of this theory and present different approaches to defining and achieving optimism. We proceed to showcase how OpL can enhance resource management in communication networks for several key problems such as caching, edge computing, network slicing, and workload assignment in decentralized O-RAN platforms. Finally, we discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of this new resource management approach.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T13:27:49Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

### ARCANE: Adaptive RISC-V Cache Architecture for Near-memory Extensions
**Authors**: Vincenzo Petrolo, Flavia Guella, Michele Caon, Pasquale Davide Schiavone, Guido Masera, Maurizio Martina

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T22:48:33Z

**Summary**: Modern data-driven applications expose limitations of von Neumann architectures - extensive data movement, low throughput, and poor energy efficiency. Accelerators improve performance but lack flexibility and require data transfers. Existing compute in- and near-memory solutions mitigate these issues but face usability challenges due to data placement constraints. We propose a novel cache architecture that doubles as a tightly-coupled compute-near-memory coprocessor. Our RISC-V cache controller executes custom instructions from the host CPU using vector operations dispatched to near-memory vector processing units within the cache memory subsystem. This architecture abstracts memory synchronization and data mapping from application software while offering software-based Instruction Set Architecture extensibility. Our implementation shows $30\times$ to $84\times$ performance improvement when operating on 8-bit data over the same system with a traditional cache when executing a worst-case 32-bit CNN workload, with only $41.3\%$ area overhead.

### Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Xuran Ma, Yexin Liu, Yaofu Liu, Xianfeng Wu, Mingzhe Zheng, Zihao Wang, Ser-Nam Lim, Harry Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T03:30:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

### CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached   Knowledge Fusion
**Authors**: Jiayi Yao, Hanchen Li, Yuhan Liu, Siddhant Ray, Yihua Cheng, Qizheng Zhang, Kuntai Du, Shan Lu, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T22:49:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized.   This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality. The code is available at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### LLM Library Learning Fails: A LEGO-Prover Case Study
**Authors**: Ian Berlot-Attwell, Frank Rudzicz, Xujie Si

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T21:53:51Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in the coding, reasoning, and tool-using abilities of LLMs have spurred interest in library learning (i.e., online learning through the creation, storage, and retrieval of reusable and composable functions, knowledge, checklists, or lemmas). Such systems often promise improved task performance through the automatic creation of broadly applicable tools, as well as superior computational performance through the caching of reasoning (i.e., the storage of generated tools). However, we find strong reason to be skeptical. We perform a deep dive into one such system, LEGO-Prover, which purports to learn reusable lemmas for mathematical reasoning. We find no evidence of the direct reuse of learned lemmas, and find evidence against the soft reuse of learned lemmas (i.e., reuse by modifying relevant examples). Crucially, we find that LEGO-Prover does not in fact improve over the simple baseline of prompting the model - the improvements in task accuracy vanish once computational cost is accounted for. Our findings suggest that serious misconceptions exist as to the effectiveness of these techniques, that a serious re-examination of the state of LLM-based library learning is required, and that we require much stronger standards for evaluation including behavioural analysis and ensuring that an equal computational budget is used for baselines.

### Localized Definitions and Distributed Reasoning: A Proof-of-Concept   Mechanistic Interpretability Study via Activation Patching
**Authors**: Nooshin Bahador

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T18:54:50Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in fine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching (CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct answer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.

### Improved Compact Genetic Algorithms with Efficient Caching
**Authors**: Prasanta Dutta, Anirban Mukhopadhyay

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T18:47:26Z

**Summary**: Compact Genetic Algorithms (cGAs) are condensed variants of classical Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that use a probability vector representation of the population instead of the complete population. cGAs have been shown to significantly reduce the number of function evaluations required while producing outcomes similar to those of classical GAs. However, cGAs have a tendency to repeatedly generate the same chromosomes as they approach convergence, resulting in unnecessary evaluations of identical chromosomes. This article introduces the concept of caching in cGAs as a means of avoiding redundant evaluations of the same chromosomes. Our proposed approach operates equivalently to cGAs, but enhances the algorithm's time efficiency by reducing the number of function evaluations. We also present a data structure for efficient cache maintenance to ensure low overhead. The proposed caching approach has an asymptotically constant time complexity on average. The proposed method further generalizes the caching mechanism with higher selection pressure for elitism-based cGAs. We conduct a rigorous analysis based on experiments on benchmark optimization problems using two well-known cache replacement strategies. The results demonstrate that caching significantly reduces the number of function evaluations required while maintaining the same level of performance accuracy.

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG pipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a pool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the generated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved documents in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder high throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG, a system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG pipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By reusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation and system-level efficiency. To fully realize the benefits of KV-cache reuse, HyperRAG incorporates a range of system-level optimizations designed to enhance efficiency and scalability. Experiments show that HyperRAG achieves a 2 - 3 throughput improvement with decoder-only rerankers while also delivering higher downstream performance compared with traditional RAG service.

**Summary**: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash. The open source code for HW simulator, methods, and experiments in this paper is available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/dynamic-sparsity .

### Cognitive Memory in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lianlei Shan, Shixian Luo, Zezhou Zhu, Yu Yuan, Yong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T09:58:19Z

**Summary**: This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

### FlowKV: A Disaggregated Inference Framework with Low-Latency KV Cache   Transfer and Load-Aware Scheduling
**Authors**: Weiqing Li, Guochao Jiang, Xiangyong Ding, Zhangcheng Tao, Chuzhan Hao, Chenfeng Xu, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T08:58:05Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated inference has become an essential framework that separates the prefill (P) and decode (D) stages in large language model inference to improve throughput. However, the KV cache transfer faces significant delays between prefill and decode nodes. The block-wise calling method and discontinuous KV cache memory allocation increase the number of calls to the transmission kernel. Additionally, existing frameworks often fix the roles of P and D nodes, leading to computational imbalances. In this paper, we propose FlowKV, a novel disaggregated inference framework, which reduces the average transmission latency of KV cache by 96%, from 0.944s to 0.053s, almost eliminating the transfer time relative to the total request latency by optimizing the KV cache transfer. FlowKV introduces the Load-Aware Scheduler for balanced request scheduling and flexible PD node allocation. This design maximizes hardware resource utilization, achieving peak system throughput across various scenarios, including normal, computational imbalance, and extreme overload conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowKV significantly accelerates inference by 15.2%-48.9% on LongBench dataset compared to the baseline and supports applications with heterogeneous GPUs.

**Authors**: Waris Gill, Justin Cechmanek, Tyler Hutcherson, Srijith Rajamohan, Jen Agarwal, Muhammad Ali Gulzar, Manvinder Singh, Benoit Dion

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T04:27:02Z

**Summary**: This report investigates enhancing semantic caching effectiveness by employing specialized, fine-tuned embedding models. Semantic caching relies on embedding similarity rather than exact key matching, presenting unique challenges in balancing precision, query latency, and computational efficiency. We propose leveraging smaller, domain-specific embedding models, fine-tuned with targeted real-world and synthetically generated datasets. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that compact embedding models fine-tuned for just one epoch on specialized datasets significantly surpass both state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary alternatives in precision and recall. Moreover, we introduce a novel synthetic data generation pipeline for the semantic cache that mitigates the challenge of limited domain-specific annotated data, further boosting embedding performance. Our approach effectively balances computational overhead and accuracy, establishing a viable and efficient strategy for practical semantic caching implementations.

**Authors**: Helen Mayer, James Richards

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T02:24:21Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of distributed caching algorithms employed in modern distributed systems. We evaluate various caching strategies including Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), and Time-Aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) against metrics such as hit ratio, latency reduction, memory overhead, and scalability. Our analysis reveals that while traditional algorithms like LRU remain prevalent, hybrid approaches incorporating machine learning techniques demonstrate superior performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we analyze implementation patterns across different distributed architectures and provide recommendations for algorithm selection based on specific workload characteristics.

### Scaling Test-Time Inference with Policy-Optimized, Dynamic   Retrieval-Augmented Generation via KV Caching and Decoding
**Authors**: Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Venkataramana Runkana

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T01:23:22Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through dynamic retrieval strategies and reinforcement fine-tuning. This approach significantly improves large language models on knowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex reasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques: Policy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use of retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS), which dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual needs. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of retrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as a lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without requiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive tasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a novel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance, mitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also incorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning depth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for faster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework reduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves significant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This integrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable RAG systems across diverse applications.

### A Pilot Study on Tunable Precision Emulation via Automatic BLAS   Offloading
**Authors**: Hang Liu, Junjie Li, Yinzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T18:51:53Z

**Summary**: This study explores the use of automatic BLAS offloading and INT8-based emulation for accelerating traditional HPC workloads on modern GPU architectures. Through the use of low-bitwidth integer units and cache-coherent Unified Memory Architecture, we emulate double-precision matrix multiplications in the MuST application without code changes. We find that accuracy depends on both arithmetic precision and the properties of the operator, which can be dealt with through tunable precision emulation. Unlike traditional mixed-precision approaches, this method preserves original algorithms while optimizing hardware utilization. We showcases the potential of improving accuracy and performance at the same time. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven hardware to transform HPC, advocating for adaptive precision strategies in future scientific computing.

### MERE: Hardware-Software Co-Design for Masking Cache Miss Latency in   Embedded Processors
**Authors**: Dean You, Jieyu Jiang, Xiaoxuan Wang, Yushu Du, Zhihang Tan, Wenbo Xu, Hui Wang, Jiapeng Guan, Zhenyuan Wang, Ran Wei, Shuai Zhao, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:38:25Z

**Summary**: Runahead execution is a technique to mask memory latency caused by irregular memory accesses. By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of long-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the cache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache misses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been limited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For implementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of area-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.   Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC and a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment, we show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with minimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By re-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design approach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building on this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe cache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a comprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide out-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads below 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1% performance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.

### Hexa-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware Training for   Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:57:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Jian Chen, Zhuoming Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ruihang Lai, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Avner May, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T01:58:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for Llama3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks.

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T01:49:58Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### Beyond Quacking: Deep Integration of Language Models and RAG into DuckDB
**Authors**: Anas Dorbani, Sunny Yasser, Jimmy Lin, Amine Mhedhbi

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T19:48:17Z

**Summary**: Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management.   To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.

### Fundamentals of Caching Layered Data objects
**Authors**: Agrim Bari, Gustavo de Veciana, George Kesidis

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T18:21:43Z

**Summary**: The effective management of large amounts of data processed or required by today's cloud or edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This paper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be stored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional data layer enhances the "quality" of the object's version but comes with an incremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in various scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding, future Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where additional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or devices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations offer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.   In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied caching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering. To this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered LRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as the number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and overheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we show that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed performance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of layers.

### Surfactants Screen Slide Electrification
**Authors**: Xiaomei Li, Zhongyuan Ni, Xiaoteng Zhou, Lisa S. Bauer, Diego Diaz, Gabriele Schäfer, Hans-Jürgen Butt

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T18:00:48Z

**Summary**: Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.

### MergeVQ: A Unified Framework for Visual Generation and Representation   with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization
**Authors**: Siyuan Li, Luyuan Zhang, Zedong Wang, Juanxi Tian, Cheng Tan, Zicheng Liu, Chang Yu, Qingsong Xie, Haonan Lu, Haoqian Wang, Zhen Lei

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T17:39:19Z

**Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.

### SentenceKV: Efficient LLM Inference via Sentence-Level Semantic KV   Caching
**Authors**: Yuxuan Zhu, Ali Falahati, David H. Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T17:08:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

### Knowledge-Aware Iterative Retrieval for Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Seyoung Song

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T14:21:15Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.

### EMO: Edge Model Overlays to Scale Model Size in Federated Learning
**Authors**: Di Wu, Weibo He, Wanglei Feng, Zhenyu Wen, Bin Qian, Blesson Varghese

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T12:34:58Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) trains machine learning models on edge devices with distributed data. However, the computational and memory limitations of these devices restrict the training of large models using FL. Split Federated Learning (SFL) addresses this challenge by distributing the model across the device and server, but it introduces a tightly coupled data flow, leading to computational bottlenecks and high communication costs. We propose EMO as a solution to enable the training of large models in FL while mitigating the challenges of SFL. EMO introduces Edge Model Overlay(s) between the device and server, enabling the creation of a larger ensemble model without modifying the FL workflow. The key innovation in EMO is Augmented Federated Learning (AFL), which builds an ensemble model by connecting the original (smaller) FL model with model(s) trained in the overlay(s) to facilitate horizontal or vertical scaling. This is accomplished through three key modules: a hierarchical activation replay cache to decouple AFL from FL, a convergence-aware communication controller to optimize communication overhead, and an ensemble inference module. Evaluations on a real-world prototype show that EMO improves accuracy by up to 17.77% compared to FL, and reduces communication costs by up to 7.17x and decreases training time by up to 6.9x compared to SFL.

**Authors**: Jewon Lee, Ki-Ung Song, Seungmin Yang, Donguk Lim, Jaeyeon Kim, Wooksu Shin, Bo-Kyeong Kim, Yong Jae Lee, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T09:10:32Z

**Summary**: Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.

### High specific impulse electrospray propulsion with small capillary   emitters
**Authors**: Manel Caballero-Pérez, Marc Galobardes-Esteban, Manuel Gamero-Castaño

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T07:04:30Z

**Summary**: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using smaller capillary emitters to achieve higher specific impulse ($I_\text{sp}$) in electrospray propulsion. Four ionic liquids were characterized using capillary emitters with tip diameters from 15 to 50 $\mu$m. Smaller diameter capillaries produced smaller and more stable Taylor cones. This stabilization enabled steady cone-jet operation at significantly lower flow rates compared to larger emitters. This was unexpected because when the jet diameter is much smaller than far-field geometric features, the minimum flow rate is thought to be solely determined by the physical properties of the propellant. Using the smaller emitters and acceleration voltages of 10 kV, specific impulses up to 3000 s could be achieved with efficiencies above 50%, approximately doubling the $I_\text{sp}$ observed with larger emitters. For one of the liquids and the smallest emitters, the beam consisted solely of ions at the lowest flow rates, similarly to studies using externally wetted and porous emitters. Another important finding was that at sufficiently low flow rates, a significant fraction of the propellant fed to the emitter is not accelerated by the electrostatic field. These propellant losses make the time-of-flight technique unreliable for determining the $I_\text{sp}$.

### SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T17:37:32Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

### CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T12:32:23Z

**Summary**: Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting, offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future. However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.

### Rethinking Key-Value Cache Compression Techniques for Large Language   Model Serving
**Authors**: Wei Gao, Xinyu Zhou, Peng Sun, Tianwei Zhang, Yonggang Wen

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T12:23:31Z

**Summary**: Key-Value cache (\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a promising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g., FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in production.

**Authors**: Elayne Lemos, Rodrigo Oliveira, Jairson Rodrigues, Rosalvo F. Oliveira Neto

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T11:58:37Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Machine Learning models at cloud have grown by tech companies. Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep Learning (DL) techniques and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We explore deploying DL models using for experiments the GECToR model, a DL solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware usage and cost at each cloud provider by 7 execution environments with 10 experiments reproduced. We found that while GPUs excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without GPU. Our analysis also identifies that processor cache size is crucial for cost-effective CPU deployments, enabling over 50% of cost reduction compared to GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based DL inference solutions without GPUs, benefiting resource-constrained users like startups.

### AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for   Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T11:13:18Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

### Mitigating Cache Noise in Test-Time Adaptation for Large Vision-Language   Models
**Authors**: Haotian Zhai, Xinyu Chen, Can Zhang, Tianming Sha, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T10:28:04Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted significant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA methods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached feature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these features to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval methods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme samples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class distributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of cached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive and reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called "Cache, Residual, Gaussian" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable residual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes with text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but also incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model intra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy features. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and adaptability.

### Training-Free Text-Guided Image Editing with Visual Autoregressive Model
**Authors**: Yufei Wang, Lanqing Guo, Zhihao Li, Jiaxing Huang, Pichao Wang, Bihan Wen, Jian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T09:46:56Z

**Summary**: Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. The code will be released.

### Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache
**Authors**: Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T03:28:44Z

**Summary**: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

### Skip-Vision: Efficient and Scalable Acceleration of Vision-Language   Models via Adaptive Token Skipping
**Authors**: Weili Zeng, Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Yichao Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T02:19:29Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.

### EEdit: Rethinking the Spatial and Temporal Redundancy for Efficient   Image Editing
**Authors**: Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T11:14:17Z

**Summary**: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

### FB$^+$-tree: A Memory-Optimized B$^+$-tree with Latch-Free Update
**Authors**: Yuan Chen, Ao Li, Wenhai Li, Lingfeng Deng

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T11:09:06Z

**Summary**: B$^+$-trees are prevalent in traditional database systems due to their versatility and balanced structure. While binary search is typically utilized for branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in main-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch operations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce fewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in range scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new high-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree (FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries, FB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix on each level of its inner nodes\textemdash referred to as features, which allows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines between B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case, FB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to function as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that combines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support efficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle atomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate latch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive experiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that FB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based indexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\ \sim\ $3.7x under 96 threads. FB$^+$-tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads, especially update workloads under contention and scan workloads.

### COSMIC: Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for Robust CLIP   Test-Time Adaptation
**Authors**: Fanding Huang, Jingyan Jiang, Qinting Jiang, Hebei Li, Faisal Nadeem Khan, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T10:34:45Z

**Summary**: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) face significant challenges in test-time adaptation to novel domains. While cache-based methods show promise by leveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable feature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during querying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances adaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and graph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations: Dual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual Semantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating textual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2 features to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual graphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class relationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on cross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50. Code is available at github.com/hf618/COSMIC.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T09:46:34Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### MVREC: A General Few-shot Defect Classification Model Using Multi-View   Region-Context
**Authors**: Shuai Lyu, Rongchen Zhang, Zeqi Ma, Fangjian Liao, Dongmei Mo, Waikeung Wong

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T09:19:53Z

**Summary**: Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

### PQCache: Product Quantization-based KVCache for Long Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hailin Zhang, Xiaodong Ji, Yilin Chen, Fangcheng Fu, Xupeng Miao, Xiaonan Nie, Weipeng Chen, Bin Cui

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T08:13:50Z

**Summary**: As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the intermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management community, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use PQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench and low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.

### Cocktail: Chunk-Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wei Tao, Bin Zhang, Xiaoyang Qu, Jiguang Wan, Jianzong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T03:20:34Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been able to handle longer and longer contexts. However, a context that is too long may cause intolerant inference latency and GPU memory usage. Existing methods propose mixed-precision quantization to the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs based on token granularity, which is time-consuming in the search process and hardware inefficient during computation. This paper introduces a novel approach called Cocktail, which employs chunk-adaptive mixed-precision quantization to optimize the KV cache. Cocktail consists of two modules: chunk-level quantization search and chunk-level KV cache computation. Chunk-level quantization search determines the optimal bitwidth configuration of the KV cache chunks quickly based on the similarity scores between the corresponding context chunks and the query, maintaining the model accuracy. Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache computation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the hardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

### TopV: Compatible Token Pruning with Inference Time Optimization for Fast   and Low-Memory Multimodal Vision Language Model
**Authors**: Cheng Yang, Yang Sui, Jinqi Xiao, Lingyi Huang, Yu Gong, Chendi Li, Jinghua Yan, Yu Bai, Ponnuswamy Sadayappan, Xia Hu, Bo Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-03-29T23:00:27Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demand substantial computational resources during inference, largely due to the extensive visual input tokens for representing visual information. Previous studies have noted that visual tokens tend to receive less attention than text tokens, suggesting their lower importance during inference and potential for pruning. However, their methods encounter several challenges: reliance on greedy heuristic criteria for token importance and incompatibility with FlashAttention and KV cache. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{TopV}, a compatible \textbf{TO}ken \textbf{P}runing with inference Time Optimization for fast and low-memory \textbf{V}LM, achieving efficient pruning without additional training or fine-tuning. Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning as an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens while remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only perform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces KV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost function considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial Distance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each source visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token pruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-03-29T04:43:11Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1\% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

**Summary**: Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

**Authors**: Hanling Zhang, Rundong Su, Zhihang Yuan, Pengtao Chen, Mingzhu Shen Yibo Fan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T18:00:12Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generation models, especially Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT), have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images. However, these models often face significant computational bottlenecks, particularly in attention mechanisms, which hinder their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DiTFastAttnV2, a post-training compression method designed to accelerate attention in MMDiT. Through an in-depth analysis of MMDiT's attention patterns, we identify key differences from prior DiT-based methods and propose head-wise arrow attention and caching mechanisms to dynamically adjust attention heads, effectively bridging this gap. We also design an Efficient Fused Kernel for further acceleration. By leveraging local metric methods and optimization techniques, our approach significantly reduces the search time for optimal compression schemes to just minutes while maintaining generation quality. Furthermore, with the customized kernel, DiTFastAttnV2 achieves a 68% reduction in attention FLOPs and 1.5x end-to-end speedup on 2K image generation without compromising visual fidelity.

### Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through   Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Xiaoye Qu, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T16:15:19Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, a novel DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration without quality loss and high fidelity to original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish long-skip connections as critical architectural components for training stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T14:11:37Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### A Refined Analysis of Massive Activations in LLMs
**Authors**: Louis Owen, Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury, Abhay Kumar, Fabian Güra

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T11:08:34Z

**Summary**: Motivated in part by their relevance for low-precision training and quantization, massive activations in large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a topic of interest. However, existing analyses are limited in scope, and generalizability across architectures is unclear. This paper helps address some of these gaps by conducting an analysis of massive activations across a broad range of LLMs, including both GLU-based and non-GLU-based architectures. Our findings challenge several prior assumptions, most importantly: (1) not all massive activations are detrimental, i.e. suppressing them does not lead to an explosion of perplexity or a collapse in downstream task performance; (2) proposed mitigation strategies such as Attention KV bias are model-specific and ineffective in certain cases. We consequently investigate novel hybrid mitigation strategies; in particular pairing Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) with Attention KV bias or Dynamic Tanh (DyT) successfully balances the mitigation of massive activations with preserved downstream model performance in the scenarios we investigated. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bluorion-com/refine_massive_activations.

**Authors**: Jiyu Chen, Shuang Peng, Daxiong Luo, Fan Yang, Renshou Wu, Fangyuan Li, Xiaoxin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T07:26:37Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) encounter challenges in processing long sequences on edge devices due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and growing memory demands from Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache optimizations struggle with irreversible token eviction in long-output tasks, while alternative sequence modeling architectures prove costly to adopt within established Transformer infrastructure. We present EdgeInfinite, a memory-efficient solution for infinite contexts that integrates compressed memory into Transformer-based LLMs through a trainable memory-gating module. This approach maintains full compatibility with standard Transformer architectures, requiring fine-tuning only a small part of parameters, and enables selective activation of the memory-gating module for long and short context task routing. The experimental result shows that EdgeInfinite achieves comparable performance to baseline Transformer-based LLM on long context benchmarks while optimizing memory consumption and time to first token.

**Summary**: The growing prevalence of data-intensive workloads, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), high-performance computing (HPC), in-memory databases, and real-time analytics, has exposed limitations in conventional memory technologies like DRAM. While DRAM offers low latency and high throughput, it is constrained by high costs, scalability challenges, and volatility, making it less viable for capacity-bound and persistent applications in modern datacenters.   Recently, Compute Express Link (CXL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling high-speed, cacheline-granular communication between CPUs and external devices. By leveraging CXL technology, NAND flash can now be used as memory expansion, offering three-fold benefits: byte-addressability, scalable capacity, and persistence at a low cost. Samsung's CXL Memory Module Hybrid (CMM-H) is the first product to deliver these benefits through a hardware-only solution, i.e., it does not incur any OS and IO overheads like conventional block devices. In particular, CMM-H integrates a DRAM cache with NAND flash in a single device to deliver near-DRAM latency. This paper presents the first publicly available study for comprehensive characterizations of an FPGA-based CMM-H prototype. Through this study, we address users' concerns about whether a wide variety of applications can successfully run on a memory device backed by NAND flash medium. Additionally, based on these characterizations, we provide key insights into how to best take advantage of the CMM-H device.

### Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory   Controller Design
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T17:48:14Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T17:37:12Z

**Summary**: We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules. To minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic electric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external magnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer mu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial direction and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the difference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between sections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field inside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and above, rising to 500 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical studies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline is maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric field of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below 1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the direction of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104 hours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for measuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The design principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly applicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in molecules, atoms, and neutrons.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T15:21:19Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### WindowKV: Task-Adaptive Group-Wise KV Cache Window Selection for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Youhui Zuo, Sibo Wei, Chen Zhang, Zhuorui Liu, Wenpeng Lu, Dawei Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T14:11:37Z

**Summary**: With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational components. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

### Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit and Real-Time: An Empirical Evaluation
**Authors**: Ashutosh Pradhan, Daniele Ottaviano, Yi Jiang, Haozheng Huang, Alexander Zuepke, Andrea Bastoni, Marco Caccamo

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T12:14:56Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of embedded hardware platforms poses significant challenges for real-time workloads. Architectural features such as Intel RDT, Arm QoS, and Arm MPAM are either unavailable on commercial embedded platforms or designed primarily for server environments optimized for average-case performance and might fail to deliver the expected real-time guarantees. Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) includes isolation features-among others, hardware per-way cache partitioning-that can improve the real-time guarantees of complex embedded multicore systems and facilitate real-time analysis. However, the DSU also targets average cases, and its real-time capabilities have not yet been evaluated. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of three real-world deployments of the Arm DSU on Rockchip RK3568, Rockchip RK3588, and NVIDIA Orin platforms. We integrate support for the DSU at the operating system and hypervisor level and conduct a large-scale evaluation using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with varying types and intensities of interference. Our results make extensive use of performance counters and indicate that, although effective, the quality of partitioning and isolation provided by the DSU depends on the type and the intensity of the interfering workloads. In addition, we uncover and analyze in detail the correlation between benchmarks and different types and intensities of interference.

### Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach
**Authors**: Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Yang Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Yehui Tang, Xudong Lu, Zhihang Liu, Yun Zheng, Yu Liu, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T11:46:22Z

**Summary**: Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.

### FlooNoC: A 645 Gbps/link 0.15 pJ/B/hop Open-Source NoC with Wide   Physical Links and End-to-End AXI4 Parallel Multi-Stream Support
**Authors**: Tim Fischer, Michael Rogenmoser, Thomas Benz, Frank K. Gürkaynak, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T09:53:15Z

**Summary**: The new generation of domain-specific AI accelerators is characterized by rapidly increasing demands for bulk data transfers, as opposed to small, latency-critical cache line transfers typical of traditional cache-coherent systems. In this paper, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC Network-on-Chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, non-blocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. Additionally, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multi-stream capable Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine simplifies network interfaces and eliminates inter-stream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Utilizing wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gbps per link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tbps for an 8x4 mesh of processors cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.

### Time and Memory Trade-off of KV-Cache Compression in Tensor Transformer   Decoding
**Authors**: Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T07:02:19Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache in the tensor version of transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference. While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanisms [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Furthermore, we introduce two types of tensor attention cache and present a trade-off between time and memory for two scenarios. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the time-memory tradeoff of KV-Cache compression in tensor attention decoding and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient tensor attention Transformer architectures.

### Solving AI Foundational Model Latency with Telco Infrastructure
**Authors**: Sebastian Barros

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T00:10:40Z

**Summary**: Latency remains a critical bottleneck for deploying foundational artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), in customer-facing, real-time applications. While cloud-based inference offers scalability, it frequently introduces delays unacceptable for interactive experiences, such as semantic search, personalized recommendations, or conversational interfaces. Telecommunications operators, historically adept at solving content latency challenges through partnerships with providers like Google and Facebook, now have a unique opportunity to address similar AI latency concerns. This paper presents a technical framework leveraging Telco infrastructure-spanning regional data centers, existing content delivery network (CDN) nodes, and near-radio access network (RAN) sites-as hierarchical "AI edges" for caching and partial inference. We explore the architectural feasibility of embedding semantic and vector-based AI inference caches within existing Telco assets, proposing tiered caching strategies and split-inference architectures that significantly reduce latency and compute costs. Additionally, we address technical challenges specific to Telcos, such as cache synchronization, model distribution, privacy, and hardware acceleration considerations. Finally, we discuss viable partnership models between telcos and AI providers, highlighting how this innovative use of telco infrastructure can unlock both improved AI user experience and new revenue streams.

### Unleashing Vecset Diffusion Model for Fast Shape Generation
**Authors**: Zeqiang Lai, Yunfei Zhao, Zibo Zhao, Haolin Liu, Fuyun Wang, Huiwen Shi, Xianghui Yang, Qingxiang Lin, Jingwei Huang, Yuhong Liu, Jie Jiang, Chunchao Guo, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T15:08:12Z

**Summary**: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Tencent/FlashVDM.

### SGDRC: Software-Defined Dynamic Resource Control for Concurrent DNN   Inference on NVIDIA GPUs
**Authors**: Yongkang Zhang, Haoxuan Yu, Chenxia Han, Cheng Wang, Baotong Lu, Yunzhe Li, Zhifeng Jiang, Yang Li, Xiaowen Chu, Huaicheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T13:59:53Z

**Summary**: Cloud service providers heavily colocate high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS), and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services on the same GPU to improve resource utilization in data centers. Among the critical shared GPU resources, there has been very limited analysis on the dynamic allocation of compute units and VRAM bandwidth, mainly for two reasons: (1) The native GPU resource management solutions are either hardware-specific, or unable to dynamically allocate resources to different tenants, or both; (2) NVIDIA doesn't expose interfaces for VRAM bandwidth allocation, and the software stack and VRAM channel architectures are black-box, both of which limit the software-level resource management. These drive prior work to design either conservative sharing policies detrimental to throughput, or static resource partitioning only applicable to a few GPU models.   To bridge this gap, this paper proposes SGDRC, a fully software-defined dynamic VRAM bandwidth and compute unit management solution for concurrent DNN inference services. SGDRC aims at guaranteeing service quality, maximizing the overall throughput, and providing general applicability to NVIDIA GPUs. SGDRC first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs through comprehensive reverse engineering and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. SGDRC applies bimodal tensors and tidal SM masking to dynamically allocate VRAM bandwidth and compute units, and guides the allocation of resources based on offline profiling. We evaluate 11 mainstream DNNs with real-world workloads on two NVIDIA GPUs. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, SGDRC achieves the highest SLO attainment rates (99.0% on average), and improves overall throughput by up to 1.47x and BE job throughput by up to 2.36x.

### Analyzing Modern NVIDIA GPU cores
**Authors**: Rodrigo Huerta, Mojtaba Abaie Shoushtary, José-Lorenzo Cruz, Antonio González

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T12:10:53Z

**Summary**: GPUs are the most popular platform for accelerating HPC workloads, such as artificial intelligence and science simulations. However, most microarchitectural research in academia relies on GPU core pipeline designs based on architectures that are more than 15 years old.   This paper reverse engineers modern NVIDIA GPU cores, unveiling many key aspects of its design and explaining how GPUs leverage hardware-compiler techniques where the compiler guides hardware during execution. In particular, it reveals how the issue logic works including the policy of the issue scheduler, the structure of the register file and its associated cache, and multiple features of the memory pipeline. Moreover, it analyses how a simple instruction prefetcher based on a stream buffer fits well with modern NVIDIA GPUs and is likely to be used. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the register file cache and the number of register file read ports on both simulation accuracy and performance.   By modeling all these new discovered microarchitectural details, we achieve 18.24% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in execution cycles than previous state-of-the-art simulators, resulting in an average of 13.98% MAPE with respect to real hardware (NVIDIA RTX A6000). Also, we demonstrate that this new model stands for other NVIDIA architectures, such as Turing. Finally, we show that the software-based dependence management mechanism included in modern NVIDIA GPUs outperforms a hardware mechanism based on scoreboards in terms of performance and area.

### Point-Cache: Test-time Dynamic and Hierarchical Cache for Robust and   Generalizable Point Cloud Analysis
**Authors**: Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Ming Cheng, Yongcai Wang, Deying Li, Chenhui Gou, Jianfei Cai

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T11:08:20Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-Cache.

### Devil is in the Uniformity: Exploring Diverse Learners within   Transformer for Image Restoration
**Authors**: Shihao Zhou, Dayu Li, Jinshan Pan, Juncheng Zhou, Jinglei Shi, Jufeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T02:58:41Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based approaches have gained significant attention in image restoration, where the core component, i.e, Multi-Head Attention (MHA), plays a crucial role in capturing diverse features and recovering high-quality results. In MHA, heads perform attention calculation independently from uniform split subspaces, and a redundancy issue is triggered to hinder the model from achieving satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by exploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads, which results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model, termed HINT, for image restoration. HINT contains two modules, i.e., the Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention (HMHA) and the Query-Key Cache Updating (QKCU) module, to address the redundancy problem that is rooted in vanilla MHA. Specifically, HMHA extracts diverse contextual features by employing heads to learn from subspaces of varying sizes and containing different information. Moreover, QKCU, comprising intra- and inter-layer schemes, further reduces the redundancy problem by facilitating enhanced interactions between attention heads within and across layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 benchmarks across 5 image restoration tasks, including low-light enhancement, dehazing, desnowing, denoising, and deraining, to demonstrate the superiority of HINT. The source code is available in the supplementary materials.

### Medha: Efficiently Serving Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference   Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Haoran Qiu, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Ramachandran Ramjee, Chaojie Zhang, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T01:58:40Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are effective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints -- like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time per Output Token (TPOT). Furthermore, no long-context inference solutions address head-of-line blocking today.   We present Medha, a system for efficient long-context LLM inference that introduces three key innovations: adaptive chunking with slack-aware scheduling to prevent head-ofline blocking, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TPOT. By combining these into a novel 3D parallelism serving engine, Medha achieves unprecedented scale -- supporting contexts up to 10M tokens with production-grade latency. Our evaluation shows Medha reduces median latency by up to 30x compared to state-of-the-art systems when serving a mix of short and long requests, while improving throughput by upwards of 5x. This enables, for the first time, efficient long-context LLM inference at scale without compromising on shorter request latencies or system efficiency.

### Visualizing the Invisible: A Generative AR System for Intuitive   Multi-Modal Sensor Data Presentation
**Authors**: Yunqi Guo, Kaiyuan Hou, Heming Fu, Hongkai Chen, Zhenyu Yan, Guoliang Xing, Xiaofan Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:56:01Z

**Summary**: Understanding sensor data can be difficult for non-experts because of the complexity and different semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This leads to a need for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we propose Vivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately reflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor variations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 503 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

### LogQuant: Log-Distributed 2-Bit Quantization of KV Cache with Superior   Accuracy Preservation
**Authors**: Han Chen, Zicong Jiang, Zining Zhang, Bingsheng He, Pingyi Luo, Mian Lu, Yuqiang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:24:45Z

**Summary**: We introduce LogQuant, a groundbreaking 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in large language model (LLM) inference, delivering substantial memory savings while preserving superior performance. Previous methods either assume that later tokens are more important or attempt to predict important tokens based on earlier attention patterns. Both approaches, however, can result in performance bottlenecks or frequent mispredictions.   LogQuant takes a different approach. By applying a log-based filtering mechanism, it selectively compresses the KV Cache across the entire context, achieving better performance with the same or even reduced memory footprint compared to existing methods. In benchmark tests, it enhances throughput by 25% and boosts batch size by 60% without increasing memory consumption. For challenging tasks such as Math and Code Completion, LogQuant improves accuracy by 40% to 200% at the same compression ratio, outperforming comparable techniques.LogQuant integrates effortlessly with popular inference frameworks like Python's transformers library. Implementation can be available in https://github.com/Concyclics/LogQuantKV.

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:52:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.

### Integrating Prefetcher Selection with Dynamic Request Allocation   Improves Prefetching Efficiency
**Authors**: Mengming Li, Qijun Zhang, Yongqing Ren, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T06:45:13Z

**Summary**: Hardware prefetching plays a critical role in hiding the off-chip DRAM latency. The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory access patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching algorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these algorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since these prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing prefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under such circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed to mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions suffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is inaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.   In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and widely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the demand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to Alecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for training and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only harmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also significantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital for temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based prefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in eight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by 5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling various types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement, Alecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the prefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage overhead.

### CalibQuant: 1-Bit KV Cache Quantization for Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Insu Han, Zeliang Zhang, Zhiyuan Wang, Yifan Zhu, Susan Liang, Jiani Liu, Haiting Lin, Mingjie Zhao, Chenliang Xu, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T23:47:51Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse applications. However, their computational overhead during deployment remains a critical bottleneck. While Key-Value (KV) caching effectively trades memory for computation to enhance inference efficiency, the growing memory footprint from extensive KV caches significantly reduces throughput and restricts prolonged deployment on memory-constrained GPU devices. To address this challenge, we propose CalibQuant, a simple yet highly effective visual quantization strategy that drastically reduces both memory and computational overhead. Specifically, CalibQuant introduces an extreme 1-bit quantization scheme, complemented by novel post-scaling and calibration techniques tailored to the intrinsic patterns of KV caches, thereby ensuring high efficiency without compromising model performance. Leveraging Triton for runtime optimization, we achieve a 10x throughput increase on InternVL models. Our method is designed to be plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating with various existing MLLMs without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving multimodal capabilities. Codes are available at https://github.com/insuhan/calibquant.

### Skew-Symmetric Matrix Decompositions on Shared-Memory Architectures
**Authors**: Ishna Satyarth, Chao Yin, Devin A. Matthews, Maggie Myers, Robert van de Geijn, RuQing G. Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T21:27:53Z

**Summary**: The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra, particularly in comparison to that of general and symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. This work examines the factorization of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$ into its $LTL^\mathrm{T}$ decomposition, where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $T$ is tridiagonal. This is also known as a triangular tridiagonalization. This operation is a means for computing the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$ as well as for solving systems of equations, across fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Its application also often requires pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. We compare and contrast previously-published algorithms with those systematically derived using the FLAME methodology. Performant parallel CPU implementations are achieved by fusing operations at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead. A key factor is the employment of new capabilities of the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework, which now supports casting level-2 and level-3 BLAS-like operations by leveraging its gemm and other kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. A prototype, concise C++ API facilitates the translation of correct-by-construction algorithms into correct code. Experiments verify that the resulting implementations greatly exceed the performance of previous work.

### Compositional Caching for Training-free Open-vocabulary Attribute   Detection
**Authors**: Marco Garosi, Alessandro Conti, Gaowen Liu, Elisa Ricci, Massimiliano Mancini

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T21:00:37Z

**Summary**: Attribute detection is crucial for many computer vision tasks, as it enables systems to describe properties such as color, texture, and material. Current approaches often rely on labor-intensive annotation processes which are inherently limited: objects can be described at an arbitrary level of detail (e.g., color vs. color shades), leading to ambiguities when the annotators are not instructed carefully. Furthermore, they operate within a predefined set of attributes, reducing scalability and adaptability to unforeseen downstream applications. We present Compositional Caching (ComCa), a training-free method for open-vocabulary attribute detection that overcomes these constraints. ComCa requires only the list of target attributes and objects as input, using them to populate an auxiliary cache of images by leveraging web-scale databases and Large Language Models to determine attribute-object compatibility. To account for the compositional nature of attributes, cache images receive soft attribute labels. Those are aggregated at inference time based on the similarity between the input and cache images, refining the predictions of underlying Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Importantly, our approach is model-agnostic, compatible with various VLMs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ComCa significantly outperforms zero-shot and cache-based baselines, competing with recent training-based methods, proving that a carefully designed training-free approach can successfully address open-vocabulary attribute detection.

### Mitigating KV Cache Competition to Enhance User Experience in LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen, Masahiro Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T18:50:09Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) serving, the KV-cache (KVC) bottleneck causes high tail Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT), impairing user experience, particularly in time-sensitive applications. However, satisfying both TTFT and TBT service-level objectives (SLOs) is challenging. To address this, we propose a system, named CacheOPT for mitigating KV Cache competition, based on key insights from our measurements, incorporating novel components. First, it estimates a request's output length, bounding the deviation with a high specified probability, adjusted based on the request arrival rate. Second, it allocates the estimated KVC demand to a request, and reuses other requests' allocated KVC to avoid preemptions while reducing waiting time. Third, it proactively allocates KVC before instead of at the time a request exhausts its allocation and reserves KVC globally to prevent preemptions. Fourth, it chooses a request that has long TBT SLO, long job remaining time and short preemption time to preempt. Fifth, it selects the shortest-latency strategy between swapping and recomputation for preemptions. Experiments show that CacheOPT achieves up to 3.29$\times$ and 2.83$\times$ lower tail TBT and tail TTFT, 47\% and 53\% higher TTFT and TBT SLO attainments, and supports up to 1.58$\times$ higher request arrival rate than the state-of-the-art methods.

### EconoServe: Maximizing Multi-Resource Utilization with SLO Guarantees in   LLM Serving
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T18:16:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EconoServe. EconoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EconoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EconoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

### xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression
**Authors**: Chi-Chih Chang, Chien-Yu Lin, Yash Akhauri, Wei-Cheng Lin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Luis Ceze, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T17:06:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV.

### HERMES: High-Performance RISC-V Memory Hierarchy for ML Workloads
**Authors**: Pranav Suryadevara

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:47:48Z

**Summary**: The growth of machine learning (ML) workloads has underscored the importance of efficient memory hierarchies to address bandwidth, latency, and scalability challenges. HERMES focuses on optimizing memory subsystems for RISC-V architectures to meet the computational needs of ML models such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. This project explores state-of-the-art techniques such as advanced prefetching, tensor-aware caching, and hybrid memory models. The cornerstone of HERMES is the integration of shared L3 caches with fine-grained coherence protocols equipped with specialized pathways to deep-learning accelerators such as Gemmini. Simulation tools like Gem5 and DRAMSim2 were used to evaluate baseline performance and scalability under representative ML workloads. The findings of this study highlight the design choices, and the anticipated challenges, paving the way for low-latency scalable memory operations for ML applications.

### Exploring the Integration of Key-Value Attention Into Pure and Hybrid   Transformers for Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: DeShin Hwa, Tobias Holmes, Klaus Drechsler

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:38:31Z

**Summary**: While CNNs were long considered state of the art for image processing, the introduction of Transformer architectures has challenged this position. While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.

### BitDecoding: Unlocking Tensor Cores for Long-Context LLMs Decoding with   Low-Bit KV Cache
**Authors**: Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Ting Cao, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T15:22:41Z

**Summary**: The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs. However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/DD-DuDa/BitDecoding.

### Choosing Augmentation Parameters in OSQP- A New Approach based on   Conjugate Directions
**Authors**: Avinash Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T13:09:03Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a new method to select the augmentation parameters in the operator splitting quadratic program (OSQP) algorithm so as to reduce the computation time of overall algorithm. The selection is based upon the information of conjugate directions of the coefficient matrix of a linear system of equations present in the algorithm. This selection makes it possible to cache these conjugate directions, instead of computing them at each iteration, resulting in faster computation of the solution of the linear system thus reducing the overall computation time. This reduction is demonstrated by a numerical example.

### Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV   Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Minsu Kim, Seongmin Hong, RyeoWook Ko, Soongyu Choi, Hunjong Lee, Junsoo Kim, Joo-Young Kim, Jongse Park

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T11:56:50Z

**Summary**: Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to achieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging, rendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.

### Register Dispersion: Reducing the Footprint of the Vector Register File   in Vector Engines of Low-Cost RISC-V CPUs
**Authors**: Vasileios Titopoulos, George Alexakis, Kosmas Alexandridis, Chrysostomos Nicopoulos, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T11:00:35Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Machine Learning (ML) applications at the edge on resource-constrained devices has accentuated the need for efficient ML processing on low-cost processors. While traditional CPUs provide programming flexibility, their general-purpose architecture often lacks the throughput required for complex ML models. The augmentation of a RISC-V processor with a vector unit can provide substantial data-level parallelism. However, increasing the data-level parallelism supported by vector processing would make the Vector Register File (VRF) a major area consumer in ultra low-cost processors, since 32 vector registers are required for RISC-V Vector ISA compliance. This work leverages the insight that many ML vectorized kernels require a small number of active vector registers, and proposes the use of a physically smaller VRF that dynamically caches only the vector registers currently accessed by the application. This approach, called Register Dispersion, maps the architectural vector registers to a smaller set of physical registers. The proposed ISA-compliant VRF is significantly smaller than a full-size VRF and operates like a conventional cache, i.e., it only stores the most recently accessed vector registers. Essential registers remain readily accessible within the compact VRF, while the others are offloaded to the cache/memory sub-system. The compact VRF design is demonstrated to yield substantial area and power savings, as compared to using a full VRF, with no or minimal impact on performance. This effective trade-off renders the inclusion of vector units in low-cost processors feasible and practical.

### iFlame: Interleaving Full and Linear Attention for Efficient Mesh   Generation
**Authors**: Hanxiao Wang, Biao Zhang, Weize Quan, Dong-Ming Yan, Peter Wonka

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T03:18:49Z

**Summary**: This paper propose iFlame, a novel transformer-based network architecture for mesh generation. While attention-based models have demonstrated remarkable performance in mesh generation, their quadratic computational complexity limits scalability, particularly for high-resolution 3D data. Conversely, linear attention mechanisms offer lower computational costs but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this trade-off, we propose an interleaving autoregressive mesh generation framework that combines the efficiency of linear attention with the expressive power of full attention mechanisms. To further enhance efficiency and leverage the inherent structure of mesh representations, we integrate this interleaving approach into an hourglass architecture, which significantly boosts efficiency. Our approach reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to pure attention-based models. To improve inference efficiency, we implemented a caching algorithm that almost doubles the speed and reduces the KV cache size by seven-eighths compared to the original Transformer. We evaluate our framework on ShapeNet and Objaverse, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality 3D meshes efficiently. Our results indicate that the proposed interleaving framework effectively balances computational efficiency and generative performance, making it a practical solution for mesh generation. The training takes only 2 days with 4 GPUs on 39k data with a maximum of 4k faces on Objaverse.

### Jenga: Effective Memory Management for Serving LLM with Heterogeneity
**Authors**: Chen Zhang, Kuntai Du, Shu Liu, Woosuk Kwon, Xiangxi Mo, Yufeng Wang, Xiaoxuan Liu, Kaichao You, Zhuohan Li, Mingsheng Long, Jidong Zhai, Joseph Gonzalez, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T02:28:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but expensive to run, especially as inference workloads grow. To lower costs, maximizing the request batch size by managing GPU memory efficiently is crucial. While PagedAttention has recently been proposed to improve the efficiency of memory management, we find that the growing heterogeneity in the embeddings dimensions, attention, and access patterns of modern LLM architectures introduces new challenges for memory allocation.   In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1) minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes, and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching logic to enhance memory reuse.   We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations. Evaluations show that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases serving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average).

 ### Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion   Tokens
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.

### Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models
**Authors**: Hansheng Chen, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Zexiang Xu, Fujun Luan, Leonidas Guibas, Gordon Wetzstein, Sai Bi

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:59:42Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

### InteractVLM: 3D Interaction Reasoning from 2D Foundational Models
**Authors**: Sai Kumar Dwivedi, Dimitrije Antić, Shashank Tripathi, Omid Taheri, Cordelia Schmid, Michael J. Black, Dimitrios Tzionas

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:59:33Z

**Summary**: We introduce InteractVLM, a novel method to estimate 3D contact points on human bodies and objects from single in-the-wild images, enabling accurate human-object joint reconstruction in 3D. This is challenging due to occlusions, depth ambiguities, and widely varying object shapes. Existing methods rely on 3D contact annotations collected via expensive motion-capture systems or tedious manual labeling, limiting scalability and generalization. To overcome this, InteractVLM harnesses the broad visual knowledge of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data. However, directly applying these models is non-trivial, as they reason only in 2D, while human-object contact is inherently 3D. Thus we introduce a novel Render-Localize-Lift module that: (1) embeds 3D body and object surfaces in 2D space via multi-view rendering, (2) trains a novel multi-view localization model (MV-Loc) to infer contacts in 2D, and (3) lifts these to 3D. Additionally, we propose a new task called Semantic Human Contact estimation, where human contact predictions are conditioned explicitly on object semantics, enabling richer interaction modeling. InteractVLM outperforms existing work on contact estimation and also facilitates 3D reconstruction from an in-the wild image. Code and models are available at https://interactvlm.is.tue.mpg.de.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:58:57Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on mobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.   We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design choices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with minimal memory footprints.   Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an 18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.   Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient deployments at significantly smaller scales.

### Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward   Hacking in Explanations
**Authors**: Pedro Ferreira, Wilker Aziz, Ivan Titov

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:49:23Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.

### Distributed Tensor Principal Component Analysis with Data Heterogeneity
**Authors**: Elynn Chen, Xi Chen, Wenbo Jing, Yichen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:43:01Z

**Summary**: As tensors become widespread in modern data analysis, Tucker low-rank Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has become essential for dimensionality reduction and structural discovery in tensor datasets. Motivated by the common scenario where large-scale tensors are distributed across diverse geographic locations, this paper investigates tensor PCA within a distributed framework where direct data pooling is impractical.   We offer a comprehensive analysis of three specific scenarios in distributed Tensor PCA: a homogeneous setting in which tensors at various locations are generated from a single noise-affected model; a heterogeneous setting where tensors at different locations come from distinct models but share some principal components, aiming to improve estimation across all locations; and a targeted heterogeneous setting, designed to boost estimation accuracy at a specific location with limited samples by utilizing transferred knowledge from other sites with ample data.   We introduce novel estimation methods tailored to each scenario, establish statistical guarantees, and develop distributed inference techniques to construct confidence regions. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that these distributed methods achieve sharp rates of accuracy by efficiently aggregating shared information across different tensors, while maintaining reasonable communication costs. Empirical validation through simulations and real-world data applications highlights the advantages of our approaches, particularly in managing heterogeneous tensor data.

### PHEONA: An Evaluation Framework for Large Language Model-based   Approaches to Computational Phenotyping
**Authors**: Sarah Pungitore, Shashank Yadav, Vignesh Subbian

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:43:00Z

**Summary**: Computational phenotyping is essential for biomedical research but often requires significant time and resources, especially since traditional methods typically involve extensive manual data review. While machine learning and natural language processing advancements have helped, further improvements are needed. Few studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) for these tasks despite known advantages of LLMs for text-based tasks. To facilitate further research in this area, we developed an evaluation framework, Evaluation of PHEnotyping for Observational Health Data (PHEONA), that outlines context-specific considerations. We applied and demonstrated PHEONA on concept classification, a specific task within a broader phenotyping process for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) respiratory support therapies. From the sample concepts tested, we achieved high classification accuracy, suggesting the potential for LLM-based methods to improve computational phenotyping processes.

### The challenge of uncertainty quantification of large language models in   medicine
**Authors**: Zahra Atf, Seyed Amir Ahmad Safavi-Naini, Peter R. Lewis, Aref Mahjoubfar, Nariman Naderi, Thomas R. Savage, Ali Soroush

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:24:11Z

**Summary**: This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent provisionality of medical knowledge.

### Enhancing LLM-Based Short Answer Grading with Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Yucheng Chu, Peng He, Hang Li, Haoyu Han, Kaiqi Yang, Yu Xue, Tingting Li, Joseph Krajcik, Jiliang Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:17:41Z

**Summary**: Short answer assessment is a vital component of science education, allowing evaluation of students' complex three-dimensional understanding. Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.

### MiLo: Efficient Quantized MoE Inference with Mixture of Low-Rank   Compensators
**Authors**: Beichen Huang, Yueming Yuan, Zelei Shao, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:09:26Z

**Summary**: A critical approach for efficiently deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with massive parameters is quantization. However, state-of-the-art MoE models suffer from non-negligible accuracy loss with extreme quantization, such as under 4 bits. To address this, we introduce MiLo, a novel method that augments highly quantized MoEs with a mixture of low-rank compensators. These compensators consume only a small amount of additional memory but significantly recover accuracy loss from extreme quantization. MiLo also identifies that MoEmodels exhibit distinctive characteristics across weights due to their hybrid dense-sparse architectures, and employs adaptive rank selection policies along with iterative optimizations to close the accuracy gap. MiLo does not rely on calibration data, allowing it to generalize to different MoE models and datasets without overfitting to a calibration set. To avoid the hardware inefficiencies of extreme quantization, such as 3-bit, MiLo develops Tensor Core-friendly 3-bit kernels, enabling measured latency speedups on 3-bit quantized MoE models. Our evaluation shows that MiLo outperforms existing methods on SoTA MoE models across various tasks.

### AnomalousNet: A Hybrid Approach with Attention U-Nets and Change Point   Detection for Accurate Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion in Video Data
**Authors**: Yusef Ahsini, Marc Escoto, J. Alberto Conejero

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:08:17Z

**Summary**: Anomalous diffusion occurs in a wide range of systems, including protein transport within cells, animal movement in complex habitats, pollutant dispersion in groundwater, and nanoparticle motion in synthetic materials. Accurately estimating the anomalous diffusion exponent and the diffusion coefficient from the particle trajectories is essential to distinguish between sub-diffusive, super-diffusive, or normal diffusion regimes. These estimates provide a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the system, facilitating the identification of particle behaviors and the detection of changes in diffusion states. However, analyzing short and noisy video data, which often yield incomplete and heterogeneous trajectories, poses a significant challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We introduce a data-driven method that integrates particle tracking, an attention   U-Net architecture, and a change-point detection algorithm to address these issues. This approach not only infers the anomalous diffusion parameters with high accuracy but also identifies temporal transitions between different states, even in the presence of noise and limited temporal resolution. Our methodology demonstrated strong performance in the 2nd Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge benchmark within the top submissions for video tasks.

### Do PhD-level LLMs Truly Grasp Elementary Addition? Probing Rule Learning   vs. Memorization in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yang Yan, Yu Lu, Renjun Xu, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:57:10Z

**Summary**: Despite high benchmark scores, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail simple problem, raising a critical question: Do LLMs learn mathematical principles or merely memorize patterns? Rather than designing increasingly complex benchmarks like recent works, we investigate this using elementary two-integer addition ($0$ to $2^{64}$), probing two core properties: commutativity ($A+B=B+A$) and compositional generalization (via isomorphic symbolic mappings, e.g., $7 \rightarrow y$). While state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 73.8-99.8\% accuracy on numerical addition, performance collapses to $\leq$7.5\% under symbolic mapping, indicating failure to generalize learned rules. Non-monotonic performance scaling with digit count and frequent commutativity violations (over 1,700 cases of $A+B \neq B+A$) further support this. Explicitly providing addition rules degrades performance by 81.2\% on average, while self-explanation maintains baseline accuracy, suggesting LLM arithmetic processing is misaligned with human-defined principles. Our findings indicate current LLMs rely on memory pattern over genuine rule learning, highlighting architectural limitations and the need for new approaches to achieve true mathematical reasoning.

### How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today   to superintelligence
**Authors**: Tomek Korbak, Mikita Balesni, Buck Shlegeris, Geoffrey Irving

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:52:52Z

**Summary**: As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.   In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.

### Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved   Temporal Reasoning in Language Models
**Authors**: Adrián Bazaga, Rexhina Blloshmi, Bill Byrne, Adrià de Gispert

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:51:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:49:15Z

**Summary**: This article surveys Evaluation models to automatically detect hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and presents a comprehensive benchmark of their performance across six RAG applications. Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses. Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.

### PrefRAG: Preference-Driven Multi-Source Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Qingfei Zhao, Ruobing Wang, Yukuo Cen, Daren Zha, Shicheng Tan, Jie Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:38:59Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a reliable external knowledge augmentation technique to mitigate hallucination issues and parameterized knowledge limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing adaptive RAG (ARAG) systems excel at in-depth exploration within a single source but struggle to effectively and controllably explore different retrieval sources, as they fail to foresee their internal knowledge features. We develop a novel multi-source ARAG system, PrefRAG, which enhances RAG by enabling in-depth and controllable exploration of diverse retrieval sources through preference-driven adaptive retrieval and self-reflection. PrefRAG first fully explores controllable local sources in adaptive retrieval and supplements with the web when appropriate, ultimately selecting the optimal source for knowledge observation. Subsequently, PrefRAG feeds answer quality feedback into the retrieval process, optimizing it from the generation perspective to produce higher-quality responses. Extensive experiments confirm its superiority, high retrieval efficiency, and knowledge controllability. PrefRAG outperforms Vanilla RAG and the leading MS-ARAG by up to 25.6% and 13.9% respectively. Additionally, PrefRAG trained with DPO achieves higher performance. The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingFei1/PrefRAG.git.

### PINNverse: Accurate parameter estimation in differential equations from   noisy data with constrained physics-informed neural networks
**Authors**: Marius Almanstötter, Roman Vetter, Dagmar Iber

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:34:57Z

**Summary**: Parameter estimation for differential equations from measured data is an inverse problem prevalent across quantitative sciences. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving such problems, especially with sparse measurements and incomplete system information. However, PINNs face convergence issues, stability problems, overfitting, and complex loss function design. Here we introduce PINNverse, a training paradigm that addresses these limitations by reformulating the learning process as a constrained differential optimization problem. This approach achieves a dynamic balance between data loss and differential equation residual loss during training while preventing overfitting. PINNverse combines the advantages of PINNs with the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers to enable convergence on any point on the Pareto front. We demonstrate robust and accurate parameter estimation from noisy data in four classical ODE and PDE models from physics and biology. Our method enables accurate parameter inference also when the forward problem is expensive to solve.

### Behind the Spotlight: A systematic assessment of outshining using NIRCam   medium-bands in the JADES Origins Field
**Authors**: Thomas Harvey, Christopher J. Conselice, Nathan J. Adams, Duncan Austin, Qiong Li, Vadim Rusakov, Lewi Westcott, Caio M. Goolsby, Christopher C. Lovell, Rachel K. Cochrane, Aswin P. Vijayan, James Trussler

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:30:31Z

**Summary**: The spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST's NIRCam instrument has revolutionised our ability to probe the internal structure of early galaxies. By leveraging deep medium-band imaging in the Jades Origins Field, we assemble comprehensive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using 19 photometric bands for over 200 high-redshift galaxies ($z \geq 4.5$). We present an analysis of this sample with particular emphasis on investigating the "outshining" phenomenon, which can bias the inferred stellar populations by masking the presence of evolved stellar populations ($\geq$ 100 Myr) with the light of bright, young O and B-type stars. We address this problem by performing spatially-resolved SED-fitting of both binned and full pixel-by-pixel photometry, which we compare to the traditional integrated approach. We find evidence for systematic underestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies ($\leq 10^9 \rm M_\odot$) with bursty star formation, which can exceed a factor of 10 in individual cases, but on average is typically a factor of 1.25-2.5, depending on the binning methodology and SFH model used. The observed mass offset correlates with burstiness (SFR$_{10 \ \rm Myr}$/SFR$_{100 \ \rm Myr}$) and sSFR, such that galaxies with recently rising SFHs have larger mass offsets. The integrated SFH models which produce the most consistent stellar masses are the double power-law and non-parametric `continuity' models, although no integrated model fully reproduces all resolved SFHs. We apply an outshining correction factor to the Stellar Mass Function at $z=7$, finding little impact within the uncertainties. We conclude that outshining can be important in individual low-mass galaxies, but the overall impact is limited and should be considered alongside other systematic SED fitting effects.

### Bayesian local clustering of age-period mortality surfaces across   multiple countries
**Authors**: Giovanni Romanò, Emanuele Aliverti, Daniele Durante

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:23:19Z

**Summary**: Although traditional literature on mortality modeling has focused on single countries in isolation, recent contributions have progressively moved toward joint models for multiple countries. Besides favoring borrowing of information to improve age-period forecasts, this perspective has also potentials to infer local similarities among countries' mortality patterns in specific age classes and periods that could unveil unexplored demographic trends, while guiding the design of targeted policies. Advancements along this latter relevant direction are currently undermined by the lack of a multi-country model capable of incorporating the core structures of age-period mortality surfaces together with clustering patterns among countries that are not global, but rather vary locally across different combinations of ages and periods. We cover this gap by developing a novel Bayesian model for log-mortality rates that characterizes the age structure of mortality through a B-spline expansion whose country-specific dynamic coefficients encode both changes of this age structure across periods and also local clustering patterns among countries under a time-dependent random partition prior for these country-specific dynamic coefficients. While flexible, this formulation admits tractable posterior inference leveraging a suitably-designed Gibbs-sampler. The application to mortality data from 14 countries unveils local similarities highlighting both previously-recognized demographic phenomena and also yet-unexplored trends.

### LLM-based Automated Grading with Human-in-the-Loop
**Authors**: Hang Li, Yucheng Chu, Kaiqi Yang, Yasemin Copur-Gencturk, Jiliang Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:23:07Z

**Summary**: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG), which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.

### IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations
**Authors**: Sneh Pandya, Yuanyuan Yang, Nicholas Van Alfen, Jonathan Blazek, Robin Walters

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:19:50Z

**Summary**: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.

### DeepNote: Note-Centric Deep Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Ruobing Wang, Qingfei Zhao, Yukun Yan, Daren Zha, Yuxuan Chen, Shi Yu, Zhenghao Liu, Yixuan Wang, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:17:17Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates factual errors and hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA) by incorporating external knowledge. However, existing adaptive RAG methods rely on LLMs to predict retrieval timing and directly use retrieved information for generation, often failing to reflect real information needs and fully leverage retrieved knowledge. We develop DeepNote, an adaptive RAG framework that achieves in-depth and robust exploration of knowledge sources through note-centric adaptive retrieval. DeepNote employs notes as carriers for refining and accumulating knowledge. During in-depth exploration, it uses these notes to determine retrieval timing, formulate retrieval queries, and iteratively assess knowledge growth, ultimately leveraging the best note for answer generation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DeepNote significantly outperforms all baselines (+10.2% to +20.1%) and exhibits the ability to gather knowledge with both high density and quality. Additionally, DPO further improves the performance of DeepNote. The code and data are available at https://github.com/thunlp/DeepNote.

**Authors**: César Leblanc, Lukas Picek, Benjamin Deneu, Pierre Bonnet, Maximilien Servajean, Rémi Palard, Alexis Joly

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:15:52Z

**Summary**: This paper describes a cascading multimodal pipeline for high-resolution biodiversity mapping across Europe, integrating species distribution modeling, biodiversity indicators, and habitat classification. The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.

### Spider: Any-to-Many Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Jinxiang Lai, Jie Zhang, Jun Liu, Jian Li, Xiaocheng Lu, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:13:38Z

**Summary**: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of various modalities. However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts, and a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates learning the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG tasks in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field. Code: https://github.com/Layjins/Spider

### Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort   for Retrieval and RAG
**Authors**: Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T02:11:05Z

**Summary**: Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:04:00Z

**Summary**: In recent years, integrated short-video and live-streaming platforms have gained massive global adoption, offering dynamic content creation and consumption. Unlike pre-recorded short videos, live-streaming enables real-time interaction between authors and users, fostering deeper engagement. However, this dynamic nature introduces a critical challenge for recommendation systems (RecSys): the same live-streaming vastly different experiences depending on when a user watching. To optimize recommendations, a RecSys must accurately interpret the real-time semantics of live content and align them with user preferences.

### Unleashing the Power of LLMs in Dense Retrieval with Query Likelihood   Modeling
**Authors**: Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xiaojie Sun, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:03:59Z

**Summary**: Dense retrieval is a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) and is the foundation for downstream tasks such as re-ranking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin.

### Scalable and Ethical Insider Threat Detection through Data Synthesis and   Analysis by LLMs
**Authors**: Haywood Gelman, John D. Hastings

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:01:47Z

**Summary**: Insider threats wield an outsized influence on organizations, disproportionate to their small numbers. This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.

### Post-Training Language Models for Continual Relation Extraction
**Authors**: Sefika Efeoglu, Adrian Paschke, Sonja Schimmler

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:01:22Z

**Summary**: Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

### Quantum Program Linting with LLMs: Emerging Results from a Comparative   Study
**Authors**: Seung Yeob Shin, Fabrizio Pastore, Domenico Bianculli

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:51:31Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the quality of quantum programs is increasingly important; however, traditional static analysis techniques are insufficient due to the unique characteristics of quantum computing. Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries. The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices.   To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research. Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.

### Asymptotics for estimating a diverging number of parameters -- with and   without sparsity
**Authors**: Jana Gauss, Thomas Nagler

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:50:55Z

**Summary**: We consider high-dimensional estimation problems where the number of parameters diverges with the sample size. General conditions are established for consistency, uniqueness, and asymptotic normality in both unpenalized and penalized estimation settings. The conditions are weak and accommodate a broad class of estimation problems, including ones with non-convex and group structured penalties. The wide applicability of the results is illustrated through diverse examples, including generalized linear models, multi-sample inference, and stepwise estimation procedures.

### GReaTer: Gradients over Reasoning Makes Smaller Language Models Strong   Prompt Optimizers
**Authors**: Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ryo Kamoi, Bo Pang, Yusen Zhang, Caiming Xiong, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:39:16Z

**Summary**: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to the design of prompts, making prompt optimization essential for enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning. Code of GReaTer is available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/GreaTer.

### Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Mehdi Fatemi, Banafsheh Rafiee, Mingjie Tang, Kartik Talamadupula

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:35:54Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. Moreover, we show that introducing a secondary phase of RL post-training, using a small set of problems and limited resources, can significantly reduce a model's chain of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:29:39Z

**Summary**: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. As we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we have a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.

### BRIDGES: Bridging Graph Modality and Large Language Models within EDA   Tasks
**Authors**: Wei Li, Yang Zou, Christopher Ellis, Ruben Purdy, Shawn Blanton, José M. F. Moura

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code. Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance. To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks. BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite. First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions. This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications. Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead). Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin. We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.

In contrast to the conventional Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), it places emphasis on motion as well as multi-object expressions, making it more arduous. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have begun to shine in RVOS due to their powerful vision-language perception capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple and effective inference optimization method to fully unleash the potential of LMMs in referring video segmentation. Firstly, we use Sa2VA as our baseline, which is a unified LMM for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Secondly, we uniformly sample the video frames during the inference process to enhance the model's understanding of the entire video. Finally, we integrate the results of multiple expert models to mitigate the erroneous predictions of a single model. Our solution achieved 61.98% J&F on the MeViS test set and ranked 1st place in the 4th PVUW Challenge MeViS Track at CVPR 2025.

**Authors**: Paul Lomazzi, Alexis P. Rouillard, Michael A. Lavarra, Nicolas Poirier, Pierre-Louis Blelly, Jean-Baptiste Dakeyo, Viviane Pierrard, Victor Réville, Christian Vocks, Simon Thomas

**Summary**: The physical processes in the solar corona that shape the solar wind remain an active research topic. Modeling efforts have shown that energy and plasma exchanges near the transition region plays a crucial role in modulating solar wind properties. Although these regions cannot be measured in situ, plasma parameters can be inferred from coronal spectroscopy and ionization states of heavy ions, which remain unchanged as they escape the corona. We introduce a new solar wind model extending from the chromosphere to the inner heliosphere, capturing thermodynamic coupling across atmospheric layers. By including neutral and charged particle interactions, we model the transport and ionisation processes of the gas through the transition region, the corona and into the solar wind. Instead of explicitly modeling coronal heating, we link its spatial distribution to large-scale magnetic field properties. Our results confirm that energy deposition strongly affects wind properties through key mechanisms involving chromospheric evaporation, thermal expansion, and magnetic flux expansion. For sources near active regions, the model predicts significant solar wind acceleration, with plasma outflows comparable to those inferred from coronal spectroscopy. For winds from large coronal holes, the model reproduces the observed anticorrelation between charge state and wind speed. However, the predicted charge state ratios are overall lower than observed. Inclusion of a population of energetic electrons enhances both heavy ion charge states and solar wind acceleration, improving agreement with observations.

### Parameter estimation of structural dynamics with neural operators   enabled surrogate modeling
**Authors**: Mingyuan Zhou, Haoze Song, Wenjing Ye, Wei Wang, Zhilu Lai

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:18:48Z

**Summary**: Parameter estimation in structural dynamics generally involves inferring the values of physical, geometric, or even customized parameters based on first principles or expert knowledge, which is challenging for complex structural systems. In this work, we present a unified deep learning-based framework for parameterization, forward modeling, and inverse modeling of structural dynamics. The parameterization is flexible and can be user-defined, including physical and/or non-physical (customized) parameters. In the forward modeling, we train a neural operator for response prediction -- forming a surrogate model, which leverages the defined system parameters and excitation forces as inputs to the model. The inverse modeling focuses on estimating system parameters. In particular, the learned forward surrogate model (which is differentiable) is utilized for preliminary parameter estimation via gradient-based optimization; to further boost the parameter estimation, we introduce a neural refinement method to mitigate ill-posed problems, which often occur in the former. The framework's effectiveness is verified numerically and experimentally, in both interpolation and extrapolation cases, indicating its capability to capture intrinsic dynamics of structural systems from both forward and inverse perspectives. Moreover, the framework's flexibility is expected to support a wide range of applications, including surrogate modeling, structural identification, damage detection, and inverse design of structural systems.

### Machine learning interatomic potential can infer electrical response
**Authors**: Peichen Zhong, Dongjin Kim, Daniel S. King, Bingqing Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:14:07Z

**Summary**: Modeling the response of material and chemical systems to electric fields remains a longstanding challenge. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and scalable alternative to quantum mechanical methods but do not by themselves incorporate electrical response. Here, we show that polarization and Born effective charge (BEC) tensors can be directly extracted from long-range MLIPs within the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, solely by learning from energy and force data. Using this approach, we predict the infrared spectra of bulk water under zero or finite external electric fields, ionic conductivities of high-pressure superionic ice, and the phase transition and hysteresis in ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ perovskite. This work thus extends the capability of MLIPs to predict electrical response--without training on charges or polarization or BECs--and enables accurate modeling of electric-field-driven processes in diverse systems at scale.

### Balancing Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation for   Unified Image Fusion
**Authors**: Xingyu Hu, Junjun Jiang, Chenyang Wang, Kui Jiang, Xianming Liu, Jiayi Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:08:35Z

**Summary**: Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multi-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework applicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named "TITA", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion (OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties. Additionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO) strategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves competitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image fusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion tasks.

### Evaluating Knowledge Graph Based Retrieval Augmented Generation Methods   under Knowledge Incompleteness
**Authors**: Dongzhuoran Zhou, Yuqicheng Zhu, Yuan He, Jiaoyan Chen, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:08:03Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.

### Emojis Decoded: Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Understanding in Social   Media Communications
**Authors**: Yuhang Zhou, Paiheng Xu, Xiyao Wang, Xuan Lu, Ge Gao, Wei Ai

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:00:36Z

**Summary**: Emojis, which encapsulate semantics beyond mere words or phrases, have become prevalent in social network communications. This has spurred increasing scholarly interest in exploring their attributes and functionalities. However, emoji-related research and application face two primary challenges. First, researchers typically rely on crowd-sourcing to annotate emojis in order to understand their sentiments, usage intentions, and semantic meanings. Second, subjective interpretations by users can often lead to misunderstandings of emojis and cause the communication barrier. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various annotation tasks, with ChatGPT demonstrating expertise across multiple domains. In our study, we assess ChatGPT's effectiveness in handling previously annotated and downstream tasks. Our objective is to validate the hypothesis that ChatGPT can serve as a viable alternative to human annotators in emoji research and that its ability to explain emoji meanings can enhance clarity and transparency in online communications. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT has extensive knowledge of emojis. It is adept at elucidating the meaning of emojis across various application scenarios and demonstrates the potential to replace human annotators in a range of tasks.

### Pr$εε$mpt: Sanitizing Sensitive Prompts for LLMs
**Authors**: Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, Mihir Bellare

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:52:40Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

### Query Smarter, Trust Better? Exploring Search Behaviours for Verifying   News Accuracy
**Authors**: David Elsweiler, Samy Ateia, Markus Bink, Gregor Donabauer, Marcos Fernández Pichel, Alexander Frummet, Udo Kruschwitz, David Losada, Bernd Ludwig, Selina Meyer, Noel Pascual Presa

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:50:13Z

**Summary**: While it is often assumed that searching for information to evaluate misinformation will help identify false claims, recent work suggests that search behaviours can instead reinforce belief in misleading news, particularly when users generate queries using vocabulary from the source articles. Our research explores how different query generation strategies affect news verification and whether the way people search influences the accuracy of their information evaluation. A mixed-methods approach was used, consisting of three parts: (1) an analysis of existing data to understand how search behaviour influences trust in fake news, (2) a simulation of query generation strategies using a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the impact of different query formulations on search result quality, and (3) a user study to examine how 'Boost' interventions in interface design can guide users to adopt more effective query strategies. The results show that search behaviour significantly affects trust in news, with successful searches involving multiple queries and yielding higher-quality results. Queries inspired by different parts of a news article produced search results of varying quality, and weak initial queries improved when reformulated using full SERP information. Although 'Boost' interventions had limited impact, the study suggests that interface design encouraging users to thoroughly review search results can enhance query formulation. This study highlights the importance of query strategies in evaluating news and proposes that interface design can play a key role in promoting more effective search practices, serving as one component of a broader set of interventions to combat misinformation.

### RevisEval: Improving LLM-as-a-Judge via Response-Adapted References
**Authors**: Qiyuan Zhang, Yufei Wang, Tiezheng YU, Yuxin Jiang, Chuhan Wu, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Fuyuan Lyu, Chen Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:42:01Z

**Summary**: With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation quality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance.

### Interpretable Style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy Clustering
**Authors**: Suhang Gu, Ye Wang, Yongxin Chou, Jinliang Cong, Mingli Lu, Zhuqing Jiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:28:56Z

**Summary**: Clustering is an efficient and essential technique for exploring latent knowledge of data. However, limited attention has been given to the interpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In addition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their own homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered, and an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering (IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is fully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples are grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors of all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the clusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making process of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices are introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by capturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different styles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data representation capability. After determining the antecedents of all the fuzzy rules, the optimization problem of IS-TSK-FC can be iteratively solved in an alternation manner. The effectiveness of IS-TSK-FC as an interpretable clustering tool is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with unknown implicit/explicit styles. Specially, the superior clustering performance of IS-TSK-FC is demonstrated on case studies where different groups of data present explicit styles. The source code of IS-TSK-FC can be downloaded from https://github.com/gusuhang10/IS-TSK-FC.

### DoCIA: An Online Document-Level Context Incorporation Agent for Speech   Translation
**Authors**: Xinglin Lyu, Wei Tang, Yuang Li, Xiaofeng Zhao, Ming Zhu, Junhui Li, Yunfei Lu, Min Zhang, Daimeng Wei, Hao Yang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:26:49Z

**Summary**: Document-level context is crucial for handling discourse challenges in text-to-text document-level machine translation (MT). Despite the increased discourse challenges introduced by noise from automatic speech recognition (ASR), the integration of document-level context in speech translation (ST) remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online framework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context. DoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages. Document-level context is integrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through auxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules. Furthermore, DoCIA leverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a simple yet effective determination mechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement, ensuring the reliability of the final results. Experimental results show that DoCIA significantly outperforms traditional ST baselines in both sentence and discourse metrics across four LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving ST performance.

### Explain with Visual Keypoints Like a Real Mentor! A Benchmark for   Multimodal Solution Explanation
**Authors**: Jaewoo Park, Jungyang Park, Dongju Jang, Jiwan Chung, Byungwoo Yoo, Jaewoo Shin, Seonjoon Park, Taehyeong Kim, Youngjae Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:23:25Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of mathematical reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), AI systems are increasingly being adopted in educational settings to support students' comprehension of problem-solving processes. However, a critical component remains underexplored in current LLM-generated explanations: visual explanation. In real-world instructional contexts, human tutors routinely employ visual aids - such as diagrams, markings, and highlights - to enhance conceptual clarity. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of visual solution explanation, which requires generating explanations that incorporate newly introduced visual elements essential for understanding (e.g., auxiliary lines, annotations, or geometric constructions). To evaluate model performance on this task, we propose MathExplain, a multimodal benchmark consisting of 997 math problems annotated with visual keypoints and corresponding explanatory text that references those elements. Our empirical results show that while some closed-source models demonstrate promising capabilities on visual solution-explaining, current open-source general-purpose models perform inconsistently, particularly in identifying relevant visual components and producing coherent keypoint-based explanations. We expect that visual solution-explaining and the MathExplain dataset will catalyze further research on multimodal LLMs in education and advance their deployment as effective, explanation-oriented AI tutors. Code and data will be released publicly.

### The Right Time Matters: Data Arrangement Affects Zero-Shot   Generalization in Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Bingxiang He, Ning Ding, Cheng Qian, Jia Deng, Ganqu Cui, Lifan Yuan, Haiwen Hong, Huan-ang Gao, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue, Huimin Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:21:36Z

**Summary**: Understanding alignment techniques begins with comprehending zero-shot generalization brought by instruction tuning, but little of the mechanism has been understood. Existing work has largely been confined to the task level, without considering that tasks are artificially defined and, to LLMs, merely consist of tokens and representations. To bridge this gap, we investigate zero-shot generalization from the perspective of the data itself. We first demonstrate that zero-shot generalization happens very early during instruction tuning, with loss serving as a stable indicator. Next, we investigate training data arrangement through similarity and granularity perspectives, confirming that the timing of exposure to certain training examples may greatly facilitate generalization on unseen tasks. Finally, we propose a more grounded training data arrangement framework, Test-centric Multi-turn Arrangement, and show its effectiveness in promoting continual learning and further loss reduction. For the first time, we show that zero-shot generalization during instruction tuning is a form of similarity-based generalization between training and test data at the instance level. Our code is released at https://github.com/thunlp/Dynamics-of-Zero-Shot-Generalization.

### Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Anja Surina, Amin Mansouri, Lars Quaedvlieg, Amal Seddas, Maryna Viazovska, Emmanuel Abbe, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:14:15Z

**Summary**: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.

**Authors**: Saeid Ario Vaghefi, Aymane Hachcham, Veronica Grasso, Jiska Manicus, Nakiete Msemo, Chiara Colesanti Senni, Markus Leippold

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:11:11Z

**Summary**: Tracking financial investments in climate adaptation is a complex and expertise-intensive task, particularly for Early Warning Systems (EWS), which lack standardized financial reporting across multilateral development banks (MDBs) and funds. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.

### 6Img-to-3D: Few-Image Large-Scale Outdoor Driving Scene Reconstruction
**Authors**: Théo Gieruc, Marius Kästingschäfer, Sebastian Bernhard, Mathieu Salzmann

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:07:31Z

**Summary**: Current 3D reconstruction techniques struggle to infer unbounded scenes from a few images faithfully. Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views. Our code is available at https://github.com/continental/6Img-to-3D, and more examples can be found at our website here https://6Img-to-3D.GitHub.io/.

### Explainable ICD Coding via Entity Linking
**Authors**: Leonor Barreiros, Isabel Coutinho, Gonçalo M. Correia, Bruno Martins

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:54:13Z

**Summary**: Clinical coding is a critical task in healthcare, although traditional methods for automating clinical coding may not provide sufficient explicit evidence for coders in production environments. This evidence is crucial, as medical coders have to make sure there exists at least one explicit passage in the input health record that justifies the attribution of a code. We therefore propose to reframe the task as an entity linking problem, in which each document is annotated with its set of codes and respective textual evidence, enabling better human-machine collaboration. By leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), together with constrained decoding, we introduce three approaches to solve this problem that prove effective at disambiguating clinical mentions and that perform well in few-shot scenarios.

### Speech-to-Trajectory: Learning Human-Like Verbal Guidance for Robot   Motion
**Authors**: Eran Beeri Bamani, Eden Nissinman, Rotem Atari, Nevo Heimann Saadon, Avishai Sintov

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:54:08Z

**Summary**: Full integration of robots into real-life applications necessitates their ability to interpret and execute natural language directives from untrained users. Given the inherent variability in human language, equivalent directives may be phrased differently, yet require consistent robot behavior. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced language understanding, they often falter in handling user phrasing variability, rely on predefined commands, and exhibit unpredictable outputs. This letter introduces the Directive Language Model (DLM), a novel speech-to-trajectory framework that directly maps verbal commands to executable motion trajectories, bypassing predefined phrases. DLM utilizes Behavior Cloning (BC) on simulated demonstrations of human-guided robot motion. To enhance generalization, GPT-based semantic augmentation generates diverse paraphrases of training commands, labeled with the same motion trajectory. DLM further incorporates a diffusion policy-based trajectory generation for adaptive motion refinement and stochastic sampling. In contrast to LLM-based methods, DLM ensures consistent, predictable motion without extensive prompt engineering, facilitating real-time robotic guidance. As DLM learns from trajectory data, it is embodiment-agnostic, enabling deployment across diverse robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate DLM's improved command generalization, reduced dependence on structured phrasing, and achievement of human-like motion.

### The Curse of CoT: On the Limitations of Chain-of-Thought in In-Context   Learning
**Authors**: Tianshi Zheng, Yixiang Chen, Chengxi Li, Chunyang Li, Qing Zong, Haochen Shi, Baixuan Xu, Yangqiu Song, Ginny Y. Wong, Simon See

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:51:06Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been widely recognized for its ability to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through the generation of explicit explanatory rationales. However, our study reveals a surprising contradiction to this prevailing perspective. Through extensive experiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based in-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning variants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales and benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected phenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical explanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality driving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning falters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from demonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual distance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers despite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative underperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process, even as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes. Notably, even long-CoT reasoning models, which excel in abstract and symbolic reasoning, fail to fully overcome these limitations despite higher computational costs. Our findings challenge existing assumptions regarding the universal efficacy of CoT, yielding novel insights into its limitations and guiding future research toward more nuanced and effective reasoning methodologies for LLMs.

### On the Performance of an Explainable Language Model on PubMedQA
**Authors**: Venkat Srinivasan, Vishaal Jatav, Anushka Chandrababu, Geetika Sharma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:42:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant abilities in retrieving medical knowledge, reasoning over it and answering medical questions comparably to physicians. However, these models are not interpretable, hallucinate, are difficult to maintain and require enormous compute resources for training and inference. In this paper, we report results from Gyan, an explainable language model based on an alternative architecture, on the PubmedQA data set. The Gyan LLM is a compositional language model and the model is decoupled from knowledge. Gyan is trustable, transparent, does not hallucinate and does not require significant training or compute resources. Gyan is easily transferable across domains. Gyan-4.3 achieves SOTA results on PubmedQA with 87.1% accuracy compared to 82% by MedPrompt based on GPT-4 and 81.8% by Med-PaLM 2 (Google and DeepMind). We will be reporting results for other medical data sets - MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU - Medicine in the future.

### DeltaProduct: Improving State-Tracking in Linear RNNs via Householder   Products
**Authors**: Julien Siems, Timur Carstensen, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil, Riccardo Grazzi

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:39:44Z

**Summary**: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKV-7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.

### Not All Data Are Unlearned Equally
**Authors**: Aravind Krishnan, Siva Reddy, Marius Mosbach

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T08:18:14Z

**Summary**: Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.

### Detecting relevant dependencies under measurement error with   applications to the analysis of planetary system evolution
**Authors**: Patrick Bastian, Nicolai Bissantz

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:25:33Z

**Summary**: Exoplanets play an important role in understanding the mechanics of planetary system formation and orbital evolution. In this context the correlations of different parameters of the planets and their host star are useful guides in the search for explanatory mechanisms. Based on a reanalysis of the data set from \cite{figueria14} we study the as of now still poorly understood correlation between planetary surface gravity and stellar activity of Hot Jupiters. Unfortunately, data collection often suffers from measurement errors due to complicated and indirect measurement setups, rendering standard inference techniques unreliable.   We present new methods to estimate and test for correlations in a deconvolution framework and thereby improve the state of the art analysis of the data in two directions. First, we are now able to account for additive measurement errors which facilitates reliable inference. Second we test for relevant changes, i.e. we are testing for correlations exceeding a certain threshold $\Delta$. This reflects the fact that small nonzero correlations are to be expected for real life data almost always and that standard statistical tests will therefore always reject the null of no correlation given sufficient data. Our theory focuses on quantities that can be estimated by U-Statistics which contain a variety of correlation measures. We propose a bootstrap test and establish its theoretical validity. As a by product we also obtain confidence intervals. Applying our methods to the Hot Jupiter data set from \cite{figueria14}, we observe that taking into account the measurement errors yields smaller point estimates and the null of no relevant correlation is rejected only for very small $\Delta$. This demonstrates the importance of considering the impact of measurement errors to avoid misleading conclusions from the resulting statistical analysis.

### Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Shaohui Mei, Lap-Pui Chau

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:20:17Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

### Debate Only When Necessary: Adaptive Multiagent Collaboration for   Efficient LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Sugyeong Eo, Hyeonseok Moon, Evelyn Hayoon Zi, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:17:52Z

**Summary**: Multiagent collaboration has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While this approach improves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due to iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries that do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration.

### Attention-Augmented Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Graph   Convolutions for Multi-Agent Task Allocation
**Authors**: Huilin Yin, Zhikun Yang, Daniel Watzenig

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T03:33:08Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.

### InstructionBench: An Instructional Video Understanding Benchmark
**Authors**: Haiwan Wei, Yitian Yuan, Xiaohan Lan, Wei Ke, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:05:09Z

**Summary**: Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q\&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42\% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q\&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources.

### Strong Baseline: Multi-UAV Tracking via YOLOv12 with BoT-SORT-ReID
**Authors**: Yu-Hsi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:03:35Z

**Summary**: Detecting and tracking multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in thermal infrared video is inherently challenging due to low contrast, environmental noise, and small target sizes. This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking. Instead of relying on the well-established YOLOv5 with DeepSORT combination, we present a tracking framework built on YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT, enhanced with tailored training and inference strategies. We evaluate our approach following the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge metrics and reach competitive performance. Notably, we achieved strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for multi-UAV tracking tasks. We provide implementation details, in-depth experimental analysis, and a discussion of potential improvements. The code is available at https://github.com/wish44165/YOLOv12-BoT-SORT-ReID .

### Probabilistic Position-Aided Beam Selection for mmWave MIMO Systems
**Authors**: Joseph K. Chege, Arie Yeredor, Martin Haardt

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:56:51Z

**Summary**: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems rely on highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss and ensure robust communication links. However, selecting the optimal beam pair efficiently remains a challenge due to the large search space and the overhead of conventional methods. This paper proposes a probabilistic position-aided beam selection approach that exploits the statistical dependence between user equipment (UE) positions and optimal beam indices. We model the underlying joint probability mass function (PMF) of the positions and the beam indices as a low-rank tensor and estimate its parameters from training data using Bayesian inference. The estimated model is then used to predict the best (or a list of the top) beam pair indices for new UE positions. The proposed method is evaluated using data generated from a state-of-the-art ray tracing simulator and compared with neural network-based and fingerprinting approaches. The results show that our approach achieves a high data rate with fewer training samples and a significantly reduced beam search space. These advantages render it a promising solution for practical mmWave MIMO deployments, reducing the beam search overhead while maintaining a reliable connectivity.

### AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal   Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification
**Authors**: Wang Tang, Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Linbo Qing, Hatice Gunes

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:52:23Z

**Summary**: Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.

### Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering
**Authors**: Xuan Zhang, Xiang Deng, Hongxing Yuan, Chunyu Wei, Yushun Fan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:51:18Z

**Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.

### Mixture-of-Personas Language Models for Population Simulation
**Authors**: Ngoc Bui, Hieu Trung Nguyen, Shantanu Kumar, Julian Theodore, Weikang Qiu, Viet Anh Nguyen, Rex Ying

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:43:05Z

**Summary**: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) paved the way for their emerging applications in various domains, such as human behavior simulations, where LLMs could augment human-generated data in social science research and machine learning model training. However, pretrained LLMs often fail to capture the behavioral diversity of target populations due to the inherent variability across individuals and groups. To address this, we propose \textit{Mixture of Personas} (MoP), a \textit{probabilistic} prompting method that aligns the LLM responses with the target population. MoP is a contextual mixture model, where each component is an LM agent characterized by a persona and an exemplar representing subpopulation behaviors. The persona and exemplar are randomly chosen according to the learned mixing weights to elicit diverse LLM responses during simulation. MoP is flexible, requires no model finetuning, and is transferable across base models. Experiments for synthetic data generation show that MoP outperforms competing methods in alignment and diversity metrics.

### Surveying Professional Writers on AI: Limitations, Expectations, and   Fears
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ivanova, Natalia Fedorova, Sergey Tilga, Ekaterina Artemova

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:35:17Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of AI-driven tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), is reshaping professional writing. Still, key aspects of their adoption such as languages support, ethics, and long-term impact on writers voice and creativity remain underexplored. In this work, we conducted a questionnaire (N = 301) and an interactive survey (N = 36) targeting professional writers regularly using AI. We examined LLM-assisted writing practices across 25+ languages, ethical concerns, and user expectations. The findings of the survey demonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs adoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and style adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide further development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.

### ZFusion: An Effective Fuser of Camera and 4D Radar for 3D Object   Perception in Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Sheng Yang, Tong Zhan, Shichen Qiao, Jicheng Gong, Qing Yang, Jian Wang, Yanfeng Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:35:03Z

**Summary**: Reliable 3D object perception is essential in autonomous driving. Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.

### Enhancing Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection in DApps Leveraging   Fine-Tuned LLM
**Authors**: Jiuyang Bu, Wenkai Li, Zongwei Li, Zeng Zhang, Xiaoqi Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:32:14Z

**Summary**: Decentralized applications (DApps) face significant security risks due to vulnerabilities in smart contracts, with traditional detection methods struggling to address emerging and machine-unauditable flaws. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance smart contract vulnerability detection. We introduce a comprehensive dataset of 215 real-world DApp projects (4,998 contracts), including hard-to-detect logical errors like token price manipulation, addressing the limitations of existing simplified benchmarks. By fine-tuning LLMs (Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B) with Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), our method achieves superior performance, attaining an F1-score of 0.83 with FFT and data augmentation via Random Over Sampling (ROS). Comparative experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prompt-based LLMs and state-of-the-art tools. Notably, the approach excels in detecting non-machine-auditable vulnerabilities, achieving 0.97 precision and 0.68 recall for price manipulation flaws. The results underscore the effectiveness of domain-specific LLM fine-tuning and data augmentation in addressing real-world DApp security challenges, offering a robust solution for blockchain ecosystem protection.

### Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Francesco Silvestrin, Chengkun Li, Luigi Acerbi

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:30:59Z

**Summary**: Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) is a sample-efficient method for approximate Bayesian inference with computationally expensive likelihoods. While VBMC's local surrogate approach provides stable approximations, its conservative exploration strategy and limited evaluation budget can cause it to miss regions of complex posteriors. In this work, we introduce Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (S-VBMC), a method that constructs global posterior approximations by merging independent VBMC runs through a principled and inexpensive post-processing step. Our approach leverages VBMC's mixture posterior representation and per-component evidence estimates, requiring no additional likelihood evaluations while being naturally parallelizable. We demonstrate S-VBMC's effectiveness on two synthetic problems designed to challenge VBMC's exploration capabilities and two real-world applications from computational neuroscience, showing substantial improvements in posterior approximation quality across all cases.

### Following the Whispers of Values: Unraveling Neural Mechanisms Behind   Value-Oriented Behaviors in LLMs
**Authors**: Ling Hu, Yuemei Xu, Xiaoyang Gu, Letao Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:23:59Z

**Summary**: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), they can present unintended biases and harmful behaviors driven by encoded values, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the value mechanisms behind them. However, current research primarily evaluates these values through external responses with a focus on AI safety, lacking interpretability and failing to assess social values in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven mechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case study, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a large-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social Values in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons responsible for encoding these values according to activation difference. Finally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior, uncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM decision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the efficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.

### On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency   and Model Performance
**Authors**: Jaskirat Singh, Emad Fallahzadeh, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:16:27Z

**Summary**: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.

**Authors**: Giulio Starace, Oliver Jaffe, Dane Sherburn, James Aung, Jun Shern Chan, Leon Maksin, Rachel Dias, Evan Mays, Benjamin Kinsella, Wyatt Thompson, Johannes Heidecke, Amelia Glaese, Tejal Patwardhan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:15:49Z

**Summary**: We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We open-source our code (https://github.com/openai/preparedness) to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.

### Combining kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in quantum   transport
**Authors**: Didrik Palmqvist, Ludovico Tesser, Janine Splettstoesser

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:09:09Z

**Summary**: We study the fluctuations of generic currents in multi-terminal, multi-channel quantum transport settings. In the quantum regime, these fluctuations and the resulting precision differ strongly depending on whether the device is of fermionic or bosonic nature. Using scattering theory, we show that the precision is bounded by constraints set by the entropy production and by the activity in the spirit of thermodynamic or kinetic uncertainty relations, valid for fermionic and bosonic quantum systems and even in the absence of time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we derive a combined thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relation, which is tight over a wide range of parameters and can hence predict the reachable precision of a device.   Since these constraints can be expressed in terms of observables accessible in transport measurements, such as currents and bandwidth, we foresee that the tight thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty-like bounds are also useful as an inference tool: they can be exploited to estimate entropy production from transport observables, such as the charge current and its noise, which are more easily accessible in experiment.

**Authors**: Carlos Peláez-González, Andrés Herrera-Poyatos, Cristina Zuheros, David Herrera-Poyatos, Virilo Tejedor, Francisco Herrera

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:05:16Z

**Summary**: The study of large language models (LLMs) is a key area in open-world machine learning. Although LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language processing capabilities, they also face several challenges, including consistency issues, hallucinations, and jailbreak vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking refers to the crafting of prompts that bypass alignment safeguards, leading to unsafe outputs that compromise the integrity of LLMs. This work specifically focuses on the challenge of jailbreak vulnerabilities and introduces a novel taxonomy of jailbreak attacks grounded in the training domains of LLMs. It characterizes alignment failures through generalization, objectives, and robustness gaps. Our primary contribution is a perspective on jailbreak, framed through the different linguistic domains that emerge during LLM training and alignment. This viewpoint highlights the limitations of existing approaches and enables us to classify jailbreak attacks on the basis of the underlying model deficiencies they exploit. Unlike conventional classifications that categorize attacks based on prompt construction methods (e.g., prompt templating), our approach provides a deeper understanding of LLM behavior. We introduce a taxonomy with four categories -- mismatched generalization, competing objectives, adversarial robustness, and mixed attacks -- offering insights into the fundamental nature of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Finally, we present key lessons derived from this taxonomic study.

### Towards Visual Text Grounding of Multimodal Large Language Model
**Authors**: Ming Li, Ruiyi Zhang, Jian Chen, Jiuxiang Gu, Yufan Zhou, Franck Dernoncourt, Wanrong Zhu, Tianyi Zhou, Tong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:01:59Z

**Summary**: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.

**Summary**: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports various BI tasks for different data roles in data preparation, analysis, and visualization by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.

### STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations   under Household Context Drifts
**Authors**: Ermanno Bartoli, Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Iolanda Leite

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:58:59Z

**Summary**: In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.

### The Dream Within Huang Long Cave: AI-Driven Interactive Narrative for   Family Storytelling and Emotional Reflection
**Authors**: Jiayang Huang, Lingjie Li, Kang Zhang, David Yip

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:54:11Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces the art project The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, an AI-driven interactive and immersive narrative experience. The project offers new insights into AI technology, artistic practice, and psychoanalysis. Inspired by actual geographical landscapes and familial archetypes, the work combines psychoanalytic theory and computational technology, providing an artistic response to the concept of the non-existence of the Big Other. The narrative is driven by a combination of a large language model (LLM) and a realistic digital character, forming a virtual agent named YELL. Through dialogue and exploration within a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE), the audience is invited to unravel the language puzzles presented by YELL and help him overcome his life challenges. YELL is a fictional embodiment of the Big Other, modeled after the artist's real father. Through a cross-temporal interaction with this digital father, the project seeks to deconstruct complex familial relationships. By demonstrating the non-existence of the Big Other, we aim to underscore the authenticity of interpersonal emotions, positioning art as a bridge for emotional connection and understanding within family dynamics.

### REWIND: Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion with   Exemplar-Based Identity Conditioning
**Authors**: Jihyun Lee, Weipeng Xu, Alexander Richard, Shih-En Wei, Shunsuke Saito, Shaojie Bai, Te-Li Wang, Minhyuk Sung, Tae-Kyun Kim, Jason Saragih

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T03:01:03Z

**Summary**: We present REWIND (Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion), a one-step diffusion model for real-time, high-fidelity human motion estimation from egocentric image inputs. While an existing method for egocentric whole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and acausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture correlations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and real-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded body-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between egocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2) diffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a single denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified Transformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while enhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND optionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior is available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method based on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further enhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both with and without exemplar-based identity conditioning.

### M-Prometheus: A Suite of Open Multilingual LLM Judges
**Authors**: José Pombal, Dongkeun Yoon, Patrick Fernandes, Ian Wu, Seungone Kim, Ricardo Rei, Graham Neubig, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:37:26Z

**Summary**: The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on natively multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.

### A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward   Modeling and Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Wenyuan Xu, Xiaochen Zuo, Chao Xin, Yu Yue, Lin Yan, Yonghui Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:34:48Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.

### A Llama walks into the 'Bar': Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning for Legal   Reasoning in the Multi-state Bar Exam
**Authors**: Rean Fernandes, André Biedenkapp, Frank Hutter, Noor Awad

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:31:22Z

**Summary**: Legal reasoning tasks present unique challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to the complexity of domain-specific knowledge and reasoning processes. This paper investigates how effectively smaller language models (Llama 2 7B and Llama 3 8B) can be fine-tuned with a limited dataset of 1,514 Multi-state Bar Examination (MBE) questions to improve legal question answering accuracy. We evaluate these models on the 2022 MBE questions licensed from JD Advising, the same dataset used in the 'GPT-4 passes the Bar exam' study. Our methodology involves collecting approximately 200 questions per legal domain across 7 domains. We distill the dataset using Llama 3 (70B) to transform explanations into a structured IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) format as a guided reasoning process to see if it results in better performance over the non-distilled dataset. We compare the non-fine-tuned models against their supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts, trained for different sample sizes per domain, to study the effect on accuracy and prompt adherence. We also analyse option selection biases and their mitigation following SFT. In addition, we consolidate the performance across multiple variables: prompt type (few-shot vs zero-shot), answer ordering (chosen-option first vs generated-explanation first), response format (Numbered list vs Markdown vs JSON), and different decoding temperatures. Our findings show that domain-specific SFT helps some model configurations achieve close to human baseline performance, despite limited computational resources and a relatively small dataset. We release both the gathered SFT dataset and the family of Supervised Fine-tuned (SFT) adapters optimised for MBE performance. This establishes a practical lower bound on resources needed towards achieving effective legal question answering in smaller LLMs.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:30:36Z

**Summary**: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Our results indicate that neural and symbolic techniques are complementary. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.

### VidCtx: Context-aware Video Question Answering with Image Models
**Authors**: Andreas Goulas, Vasileios Mezaris, Ioannis Patras

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:20:37Z

**Summary**: To address computational and memory limitations of Large Multimodal Models in the Video Question-Answering task, several recent methods extract textual representations per frame (e.g., by captioning) and feed them to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes them to produce the final response. However, in this way, the LLM does not have access to visual information and often has to process repetitive textual descriptions of nearby frames. To address those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel training-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both visual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames that give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular intervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames. Those will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the question at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the context/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we chose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet effective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions. This methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the video and scale to a high number of frames. Experiments show that VidCtx achieves competitive performance among approaches that rely on open models on three public Video QA benchmarks, NExT-QA, IntentQA and STAR. Our code is available at https://github.com/IDT-ITI/VidCtx.

### Constrained Gaussian Process Motion Planning via Stein Variational   Newton Inference
**Authors**: Jiayun Li, Kay Pompetzki, An Thai Le, Haolei Tong, Jan Peters, Georgia Chalvatzaki

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:20:11Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP) is a widely used framework for generating smooth trajectories within a limited compute time--an essential requirement in many robotic applications. However, traditional GPMP approaches often struggle with enforcing hard nonlinear constraints and rely on Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solutions that disregard the full Bayesian posterior. This limits planning diversity and ultimately hampers decision-making. Recent efforts to integrate Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) into motion planning have shown promise in handling complex constraints. Nonetheless, these methods still face persistent challenges, such as difficulties in strictly enforcing constraints and inefficiencies when the probabilistic inference problem is poorly conditioned. To address these issues, we propose a novel constrained Stein Variational Gaussian Process Motion Planning (cSGPMP) framework, incorporating a GPMP prior specifically designed for trajectory optimization under hard constraints. Our approach improves the efficiency of particle-based inference while explicitly handling nonlinear constraints. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of GPMP to motion planning scenarios demanding robust Bayesian inference, strict constraint adherence, and computational efficiency within a limited time. We validate our method on standard benchmarks, achieving an average success rate of 98.57% across 350 planning tasks, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. This demonstrates the ability of our method to discover and use diverse trajectory modes, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in complex environments, and delivering significant improvements over standard baselines without incurring major computational costs.

### Boosting Relational Deep Learning with Pretrained Tabular Models
**Authors**: Veronica Lachi, Antonio Longa, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini, Bruno Ribeiro

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:19:04Z

**Summary**: Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.

### Modeling the circumstellar interaction around SN 2004gq
**Authors**: A. P. Nagy, B. H. Pál, T. Szalai

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:59:47Z

**Summary**: The relationship between the mass-loss history and final evolutionary stage of massive stars and the properties of the observable supernova (SN) is still under debate. This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe, where the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its evolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the exploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may contribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the interaction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be investigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within around $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely unexplored for these objects.   Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC) analysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the unusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction scenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this with a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the surrounding circumstellar medium. We also analyzed the available radio LCs (taken at 1.4,\ 4.9 and 8.5 GHz) of SN 2004gq to verify our estimated average mass-loss rate, which is one of the most crucial physical properties related to CSM models.   We infer reasonable parameters for SN 2004gq using radioactive decay and magnetar energy input. To power the entire LC, we must also add an extra energy source related to the CSM. We determine the most essential parameter of this medium: the average mass-loss rate from both LC and radio data fitting. We find that the suggested hidden circumstellar interaction is a viable mechanism that provides the required energy deficiency and that it can be estimated using a simple semi-analytic model.

### AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM   Agents
**Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Christopher M. Poskitt, Jun Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:57:45Z

**Summary**: Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:57:40Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.

### Collab-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Complex Question   Answering via White-Box and Black-Box LLM Collaboration
**Authors**: Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Joyce C. Ho, Haoyu Wang, Carl Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:52:22Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle to handle multi-hop question-answering tasks accurately due to irrelevant context retrieval and limited complex reasoning capabilities. We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a blackbox large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions. The code of Collab-RAG is available on https://github.com/ritaranx/Collab-RAG/.

### DeepResearcher: Scaling Deep Research via Reinforcement Learning in   Real-world Environments
**Authors**: Yuxiang Zheng, Dayuan Fu, Xiangkun Hu, Xiaojie Cai, Lyumanshan Ye, Pengrui Lu, Pengfei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:45:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications. We release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.

**Summary**: Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.

### Practical Acoustic Eavesdropping On Typed Passphrases
**Authors**: Darren Fürst, Andreas Aßmuth

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:07:08Z

**Summary**: Cloud services have become an essential infrastructure for enterprises and individuals. Access to these cloud services is typically governed by Identity and Access Management systems, where user authentication often relies on passwords. While best practices dictate the implementation of multi-factor authentication, it's a reality that many such users remain solely protected by passwords. This reliance on passwords creates a significant vulnerability, as these credentials can be compromised through various means, including side-channel attacks. This paper exploits keyboard acoustic emanations to infer typed natural language passphrases via unsupervised learning, necessitating no previous training data. Whilst this work focuses on short passphrases, it is also applicable to longer messages, such as confidential emails, where the margin for error is much greater, than with passphrases, making the attack even more effective in such a setting. Unlike traditional attacks that require physical access to the target device, acoustic side-channel attacks can be executed within the vicinity, without the user's knowledge, offering a worthwhile avenue for malicious actors. Our findings replicate and extend previous work, confirming that cross-correlation audio preprocessing outperforms methods like mel-frequency-cepstral coefficients and fast-fourier transforms in keystroke clustering. Moreover, we show that partial passphrase recovery through clustering and a dictionary attack can enable faster than brute-force attacks, further emphasizing the risks posed by this attack vector.

### SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Justus Westerhoff, Erblina Purellku, Jakob Hackstein, Leo Pinetzki, Lorenz Hufe

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:01:38Z

**Summary**: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper under https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLISS-e-V/SCAM, along with the code for evaluations at https://github.com/Bliss-e-V/SCAM.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Cost-Effective, Multilingual   Depression Detection and Severity Assessment
**Authors**: Longdi Xian, Jianzhang Ni, Mingzhu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:58:19Z

**Summary**: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that is difficult to detect early due to subjective symptom assessments. Recent advancements in large language models have offered efficient and cost-effective approaches for this objective. In this study, we evaluated the performance of four LLMs in depression detection using clinical interview data. We selected the best performing model and further tested it in the severity evaluation scenario and knowledge enhanced scenario. The robustness was evaluated in complex diagnostic scenarios using a dataset comprising 51074 statements from six different mental disorders. We found that DeepSeek V3 is the most reliable and cost-effective model for depression detection, performing well in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, with zero-shot being the most efficient choice. The evaluation of severity showed low agreement with the human evaluator, particularly for mild depression. The model maintains stably high AUCs for detecting depression in complex diagnostic scenarios. These findings highlight DeepSeek V3s strong potential for text-based depression detection in real-world clinical applications. However, they also underscore the need for further refinement in severity assessment and the mitigation of potential biases to enhance clinical reliability.

### SoK: LLM-based Log Parsing
**Authors**: Viktor Beck, Max Landauer, Markus Wurzenberger, Florian Skopik, Andreas Rauber

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:41:04Z

**Summary**: Log data, generated by software systems, provides crucial insights for tasks like monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection. Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion   Tokens
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:58:57Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on mobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.   We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design choices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with minimal memory footprints.   Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an 18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.   Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient deployments at significantly smaller scales.

### Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward   Hacking in Explanations
**Authors**: Pedro Ferreira, Wilker Aziz, Ivan Titov

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:49:23Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.

### PHEONA: An Evaluation Framework for Large Language Model-based   Approaches to Computational Phenotyping
**Authors**: Sarah Pungitore, Shashank Yadav, Vignesh Subbian

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:43:00Z

**Summary**: Computational phenotyping is essential for biomedical research but often requires significant time and resources, especially since traditional methods typically involve extensive manual data review. While machine learning and natural language processing advancements have helped, further improvements are needed. Few studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) for these tasks despite known advantages of LLMs for text-based tasks. To facilitate further research in this area, we developed an evaluation framework, Evaluation of PHEnotyping for Observational Health Data (PHEONA), that outlines context-specific considerations. We applied and demonstrated PHEONA on concept classification, a specific task within a broader phenotyping process for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) respiratory support therapies. From the sample concepts tested, we achieved high classification accuracy, suggesting the potential for LLM-based methods to improve computational phenotyping processes.

### The challenge of uncertainty quantification of large language models in   medicine
**Authors**: Zahra Atf, Seyed Amir Ahmad Safavi-Naini, Peter R. Lewis, Aref Mahjoubfar, Nariman Naderi, Thomas R. Savage, Ali Soroush

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:24:11Z

**Summary**: This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent provisionality of medical knowledge.

### Enhancing LLM-Based Short Answer Grading with Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Yucheng Chu, Peng He, Hang Li, Haoyu Han, Kaiqi Yang, Yu Xue, Tingting Li, Joseph Krajcik, Jiliang Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T17:17:41Z

**Summary**: Short answer assessment is a vital component of science education, allowing evaluation of students' complex three-dimensional understanding. Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.

### Do PhD-level LLMs Truly Grasp Elementary Addition? Probing Rule Learning   vs. Memorization in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yang Yan, Yu Lu, Renjun Xu, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:57:10Z

**Summary**: Despite high benchmark scores, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail simple problem, raising a critical question: Do LLMs learn mathematical principles or merely memorize patterns? Rather than designing increasingly complex benchmarks like recent works, we investigate this using elementary two-integer addition ($0$ to $2^{64}$), probing two core properties: commutativity ($A+B=B+A$) and compositional generalization (via isomorphic symbolic mappings, e.g., $7 \rightarrow y$). While state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 73.8-99.8\% accuracy on numerical addition, performance collapses to $\leq$7.5\% under symbolic mapping, indicating failure to generalize learned rules. Non-monotonic performance scaling with digit count and frequent commutativity violations (over 1,700 cases of $A+B \neq B+A$) further support this. Explicitly providing addition rules degrades performance by 81.2\% on average, while self-explanation maintains baseline accuracy, suggesting LLM arithmetic processing is misaligned with human-defined principles. Our findings indicate current LLMs rely on memory pattern over genuine rule learning, highlighting architectural limitations and the need for new approaches to achieve true mathematical reasoning.

### How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today   to superintelligence
**Authors**: Tomek Korbak, Mikita Balesni, Buck Shlegeris, Geoffrey Irving

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:52:52Z

**Summary**: As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.   In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.

### Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved   Temporal Reasoning in Language Models
**Authors**: Adrián Bazaga, Rexhina Blloshmi, Bill Byrne, Adrià de Gispert

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:51:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.

### Real-Time Evaluation Models for RAG: Who Detects Hallucinations Best?
**Authors**: Ashish Sardana

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:49:15Z

**Summary**: This article surveys Evaluation models to automatically detect hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and presents a comprehensive benchmark of their performance across six RAG applications. Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses. Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.

### PrefRAG: Preference-Driven Multi-Source Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Qingfei Zhao, Ruobing Wang, Yukuo Cen, Daren Zha, Shicheng Tan, Jie Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:38:59Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a reliable external knowledge augmentation technique to mitigate hallucination issues and parameterized knowledge limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing adaptive RAG (ARAG) systems excel at in-depth exploration within a single source but struggle to effectively and controllably explore different retrieval sources, as they fail to foresee their internal knowledge features. We develop a novel multi-source ARAG system, PrefRAG, which enhances RAG by enabling in-depth and controllable exploration of diverse retrieval sources through preference-driven adaptive retrieval and self-reflection. PrefRAG first fully explores controllable local sources in adaptive retrieval and supplements with the web when appropriate, ultimately selecting the optimal source for knowledge observation. Subsequently, PrefRAG feeds answer quality feedback into the retrieval process, optimizing it from the generation perspective to produce higher-quality responses. Extensive experiments confirm its superiority, high retrieval efficiency, and knowledge controllability. PrefRAG outperforms Vanilla RAG and the leading MS-ARAG by up to 25.6% and 13.9% respectively. Additionally, PrefRAG trained with DPO achieves higher performance. The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingFei1/PrefRAG.git.

### LLM-based Automated Grading with Human-in-the-Loop
**Authors**: Hang Li, Yucheng Chu, Kaiqi Yang, Yasemin Copur-Gencturk, Jiliang Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:23:07Z

**Summary**: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG), which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.

**Authors**: Ruobing Wang, Qingfei Zhao, Yukun Yan, Daren Zha, Yuxuan Chen, Shi Yu, Zhenghao Liu, Yixuan Wang, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:17:17Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates factual errors and hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA) by incorporating external knowledge. However, existing adaptive RAG methods rely on LLMs to predict retrieval timing and directly use retrieved information for generation, often failing to reflect real information needs and fully leverage retrieved knowledge. We develop DeepNote, an adaptive RAG framework that achieves in-depth and robust exploration of knowledge sources through note-centric adaptive retrieval. DeepNote employs notes as carriers for refining and accumulating knowledge. During in-depth exploration, it uses these notes to determine retrieval timing, formulate retrieval queries, and iteratively assess knowledge growth, ultimately leveraging the best note for answer generation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DeepNote significantly outperforms all baselines (+10.2% to +20.1%) and exhibits the ability to gather knowledge with both high density and quality. Additionally, DPO further improves the performance of DeepNote. The code and data are available at https://github.com/thunlp/DeepNote.

### Mapping biodiversity at very-high resolution in Europe
**Authors**: César Leblanc, Lukas Picek, Benjamin Deneu, Pierre Bonnet, Maximilien Servajean, Rémi Palard, Alexis Joly

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:15:52Z

**Summary**: This paper describes a cascading multimodal pipeline for high-resolution biodiversity mapping across Europe, integrating species distribution modeling, biodiversity indicators, and habitat classification. The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.

### Spider: Any-to-Many Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Jinxiang Lai, Jie Zhang, Jun Liu, Jian Li, Xiaocheng Lu, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:13:38Z

**Summary**: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of various modalities. However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts, and a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates learning the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG tasks in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field. Code: https://github.com/Layjins/Spider

### Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort   for Retrieval and RAG
**Authors**: Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T02:11:05Z

**Summary**: Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.

**Authors**: Yueyang Liu, Jiangxia Cao, Shen Wang, Shuang Wen, Xiang Chen, Xiangyu Wu, Shuang Yang, Zhaojie Liu, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:04:00Z

**Summary**: In recent years, integrated short-video and live-streaming platforms have gained massive global adoption, offering dynamic content creation and consumption. Unlike pre-recorded short videos, live-streaming enables real-time interaction between authors and users, fostering deeper engagement. However, this dynamic nature introduces a critical challenge for recommendation systems (RecSys): the same live-streaming vastly different experiences depending on when a user watching. To optimize recommendations, a RecSys must accurately interpret the real-time semantics of live content and align them with user preferences.

### Unleashing the Power of LLMs in Dense Retrieval with Query Likelihood   Modeling
**Authors**: Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xiaojie Sun, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:03:59Z

**Summary**: Dense retrieval is a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) and is the foundation for downstream tasks such as re-ranking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin.

### Scalable and Ethical Insider Threat Detection through Data Synthesis and   Analysis by LLMs
**Authors**: Haywood Gelman, John D. Hastings

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:01:47Z

**Summary**: Insider threats wield an outsized influence on organizations, disproportionate to their small numbers. This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.

### Post-Training Language Models for Continual Relation Extraction
**Authors**: Sefika Efeoglu, Adrian Paschke, Sonja Schimmler

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T16:01:22Z

**Summary**: Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

### Quantum Program Linting with LLMs: Emerging Results from a Comparative   Study
**Authors**: Seung Yeob Shin, Fabrizio Pastore, Domenico Bianculli

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:51:31Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the quality of quantum programs is increasingly important; however, traditional static analysis techniques are insufficient due to the unique characteristics of quantum computing. Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries. The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices.   To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research. Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.

### GReaTer: Gradients over Reasoning Makes Smaller Language Models Strong   Prompt Optimizers
**Authors**: Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ryo Kamoi, Bo Pang, Yusen Zhang, Caiming Xiong, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:39:16Z

**Summary**: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to the design of prompts, making prompt optimization essential for enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning. Code of GReaTer is available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/GreaTer.

### Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Mehdi Fatemi, Banafsheh Rafiee, Mingjie Tang, Kartik Talamadupula

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:35:54Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. Moreover, we show that introducing a secondary phase of RL post-training, using a small set of problems and limited resources, can significantly reduce a model's chain of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:29:39Z

**Summary**: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. As we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we have a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.

### BRIDGES: Bridging Graph Modality and Large Language Models within EDA   Tasks
**Authors**: Wei Li, Yang Zou, Christopher Ellis, Ruben Purdy, Shawn Blanton, José M. F. Moura

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code. Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance. To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks. BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite. First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions. This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications. Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead). Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin. We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.

### PRDTs: Composable Knowledge-Based Consensus Protocols with Replicated   Data Types
**Authors**: Julian Haas, Ragnar Mogk, Annette Bieniusa, Mira Mezini

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:17:35Z

**Summary**: Consensus protocols are fundamental in distributed systems as they enable software with strong consistency properties. However, designing optimized protocols for specific use-cases under certain system assumptions is typically a laborious and error-prone process requiring expert knowledge. While most recent optimized protocols are variations of well-known algorithms like Paxos or Raft, they often necessitate complete re-implementations, potentially introducing new bugs and complicating the application of existing verification results.This approach stands in the way of application-specific consistency protocols that can easily be amended or swapped out, depending on the given application and deployment scenario.   We propose Protocol Replicated Data Types (PRDTs), a novel programming model for implementing consensus protocols using replicated data types (RDTs). Inspired by the knowledge-based view of consensus, PRDTs employ RDTs to monotonically accumulate until agreement is reached. This approach allows for implementations focusing on high-level protocol logic with minimal network environment assumptions. Moreover, by applying existing algebraic composition techniques for RDTs in the PRDT context, we enable composable protocol building-blocks for implementing complex protocols. We present a formal model of our approach, demonstrate its application in PRDT-based implementations of existing protocols, and report empirical evaluation results. Our findings indicate that the PRDT approach offers enhanced flexibility and composability in protocol design, facilitates reasoning about correctness, and does not suffer from inherent performance limitations that would prevent its use in real-world applications.

### Evaluating Knowledge Graph Based Retrieval Augmented Generation Methods   under Knowledge Incompleteness
**Authors**: Dongzhuoran Zhou, Yuqicheng Zhu, Yuan He, Jiaoyan Chen, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:08:03Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.

### Emojis Decoded: Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Understanding in Social   Media Communications
**Authors**: Yuhang Zhou, Paiheng Xu, Xiyao Wang, Xuan Lu, Ge Gao, Wei Ai

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T15:00:36Z

**Summary**: Emojis, which encapsulate semantics beyond mere words or phrases, have become prevalent in social network communications. This has spurred increasing scholarly interest in exploring their attributes and functionalities. However, emoji-related research and application face two primary challenges. First, researchers typically rely on crowd-sourcing to annotate emojis in order to understand their sentiments, usage intentions, and semantic meanings. Second, subjective interpretations by users can often lead to misunderstandings of emojis and cause the communication barrier. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various annotation tasks, with ChatGPT demonstrating expertise across multiple domains. In our study, we assess ChatGPT's effectiveness in handling previously annotated and downstream tasks. Our objective is to validate the hypothesis that ChatGPT can serve as a viable alternative to human annotators in emoji research and that its ability to explain emoji meanings can enhance clarity and transparency in online communications. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT has extensive knowledge of emojis. It is adept at elucidating the meaning of emojis across various application scenarios and demonstrates the potential to replace human annotators in a range of tasks.

### Pr$εε$mpt: Sanitizing Sensitive Prompts for LLMs
**Authors**: Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, Mihir Bellare

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:52:40Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

### Query Smarter, Trust Better? Exploring Search Behaviours for Verifying   News Accuracy
**Authors**: David Elsweiler, Samy Ateia, Markus Bink, Gregor Donabauer, Marcos Fernández Pichel, Alexander Frummet, Udo Kruschwitz, David Losada, Bernd Ludwig, Selina Meyer, Noel Pascual Presa

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:50:13Z

**Summary**: While it is often assumed that searching for information to evaluate misinformation will help identify false claims, recent work suggests that search behaviours can instead reinforce belief in misleading news, particularly when users generate queries using vocabulary from the source articles. Our research explores how different query generation strategies affect news verification and whether the way people search influences the accuracy of their information evaluation. A mixed-methods approach was used, consisting of three parts: (1) an analysis of existing data to understand how search behaviour influences trust in fake news, (2) a simulation of query generation strategies using a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the impact of different query formulations on search result quality, and (3) a user study to examine how 'Boost' interventions in interface design can guide users to adopt more effective query strategies. The results show that search behaviour significantly affects trust in news, with successful searches involving multiple queries and yielding higher-quality results. Queries inspired by different parts of a news article produced search results of varying quality, and weak initial queries improved when reformulated using full SERP information. Although 'Boost' interventions had limited impact, the study suggests that interface design encouraging users to thoroughly review search results can enhance query formulation. This study highlights the importance of query strategies in evaluating news and proposes that interface design can play a key role in promoting more effective search practices, serving as one component of a broader set of interventions to combat misinformation.

### Towards Optimal Heterogeneous Client Sampling in Multi-Model Federated   Learning
**Authors**: Haoran Zhang, Zejun Gong, Zekai Li, Marie Siew, Carlee Joe-Wong, Rachid El-Azouzi

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T03:29:49Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) allows edge devices to collaboratively train models without sharing local data. As FL gains popularity, clients may need to train multiple unrelated FL models, but communication constraints limit their ability to train all models simultaneously. While clients could train FL models sequentially, opportunistically having FL clients concurrently train different models -- termed multi-model federated learning (MMFL) -- can reduce the overall training time. Prior work uses simple client-to-model assignments that do not optimize the contribution of each client to each model over the course of its training. Prior work on single-model FL shows that intelligent client selection can greatly accelerate convergence, but na\"ive extensions to MMFL can violate heterogeneous resource constraints at both the server and the clients. In this work, we develop a novel convergence analysis of MMFL with arbitrary client sampling methods, theoretically demonstrating the strengths and limitations of previous well-established gradient-based methods. Motivated by this analysis, we propose MMFL-LVR, a loss-based sampling method that minimizes training variance while explicitly respecting communication limits at the server and reducing computational costs at the clients. We extend this to MMFL-StaleVR, which incorporates stale updates for improved efficiency and stability, and MMFL-StaleVRE, a lightweight variant suitable for low-overhead deployment. Experiments show our methods improve average accuracy by up to 19.1% over random sampling, with only a 5.4% gap from the theoretical optimum (full client participation).

### RevisEval: Improving LLM-as-a-Judge via Response-Adapted References
**Authors**: Qiyuan Zhang, Yufei Wang, Tiezheng YU, Yuxin Jiang, Chuhan Wu, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Fuyuan Lyu, Chen Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:42:01Z

**Summary**: With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation quality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance.

### DoCIA: An Online Document-Level Context Incorporation Agent for Speech   Translation
**Authors**: Xinglin Lyu, Wei Tang, Yuang Li, Xiaofeng Zhao, Ming Zhu, Junhui Li, Yunfei Lu, Min Zhang, Daimeng Wei, Hao Yang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:26:49Z

**Summary**: Document-level context is crucial for handling discourse challenges in text-to-text document-level machine translation (MT). Despite the increased discourse challenges introduced by noise from automatic speech recognition (ASR), the integration of document-level context in speech translation (ST) remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online framework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context. DoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages. Document-level context is integrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through auxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules. Furthermore, DoCIA leverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a simple yet effective determination mechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement, ensuring the reliability of the final results. Experimental results show that DoCIA significantly outperforms traditional ST baselines in both sentence and discourse metrics across four LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving ST performance.

### Explain with Visual Keypoints Like a Real Mentor! A Benchmark for   Multimodal Solution Explanation
**Authors**: Jaewoo Park, Jungyang Park, Dongju Jang, Jiwan Chung, Byungwoo Yoo, Jaewoo Shin, Seonjoon Park, Taehyeong Kim, Youngjae Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:23:25Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of mathematical reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), AI systems are increasingly being adopted in educational settings to support students' comprehension of problem-solving processes. However, a critical component remains underexplored in current LLM-generated explanations: visual explanation. In real-world instructional contexts, human tutors routinely employ visual aids - such as diagrams, markings, and highlights - to enhance conceptual clarity. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of visual solution explanation, which requires generating explanations that incorporate newly introduced visual elements essential for understanding (e.g., auxiliary lines, annotations, or geometric constructions). To evaluate model performance on this task, we propose MathExplain, a multimodal benchmark consisting of 997 math problems annotated with visual keypoints and corresponding explanatory text that references those elements. Our empirical results show that while some closed-source models demonstrate promising capabilities on visual solution-explaining, current open-source general-purpose models perform inconsistently, particularly in identifying relevant visual components and producing coherent keypoint-based explanations. We expect that visual solution-explaining and the MathExplain dataset will catalyze further research on multimodal LLMs in education and advance their deployment as effective, explanation-oriented AI tutors. Code and data will be released publicly.

### The Right Time Matters: Data Arrangement Affects Zero-Shot   Generalization in Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Bingxiang He, Ning Ding, Cheng Qian, Jia Deng, Ganqu Cui, Lifan Yuan, Haiwen Hong, Huan-ang Gao, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue, Huimin Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:21:36Z

**Summary**: Understanding alignment techniques begins with comprehending zero-shot generalization brought by instruction tuning, but little of the mechanism has been understood. Existing work has largely been confined to the task level, without considering that tasks are artificially defined and, to LLMs, merely consist of tokens and representations. To bridge this gap, we investigate zero-shot generalization from the perspective of the data itself. We first demonstrate that zero-shot generalization happens very early during instruction tuning, with loss serving as a stable indicator. Next, we investigate training data arrangement through similarity and granularity perspectives, confirming that the timing of exposure to certain training examples may greatly facilitate generalization on unseen tasks. Finally, we propose a more grounded training data arrangement framework, Test-centric Multi-turn Arrangement, and show its effectiveness in promoting continual learning and further loss reduction. For the first time, we show that zero-shot generalization during instruction tuning is a form of similarity-based generalization between training and test data at the instance level. Our code is released at https://github.com/thunlp/Dynamics-of-Zero-Shot-Generalization.

**Summary**: Road ponding presents a significant threat to vehicle safety, particularly in adverse fog conditions, where reliable detection remains a persistent challenge for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To address this, we propose ABCDWaveNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy for robust ponding detection in fog. The core of ABCDWaveNet achieves this synergy by integrating dynamic convolution for adaptive feature extraction across varying visibilities with a wavelet-based module for synergistic frequency-spatial feature enhancement, significantly improving robustness against fog interference. Building on this foundation, ABCDWaveNet captures multi-scale structural and contextual information, subsequently employing an Adaptive Attention Coupling Gate (AACG) to adaptively fuse global and local features for enhanced accuracy. To facilitate realistic evaluations under combined adverse conditions, we introduce the Foggy Low-Light Puddle dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABCDWaveNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving significant Intersection over Union (IoU) gains of 3.51%, 1.75%, and 1.03% on the Foggy-Puddle, Puddle-1000, and our Foggy Low-Light Puddle datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its processing speed of 25.48 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin confirms its suitability for ADAS deployment. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy within ABCDWaveNet, offering valuable insights for developing proactive road safety solutions capable of operating reliably in challenging weather conditions.

**Authors**: Anja Surina, Amin Mansouri, Lars Quaedvlieg, Amal Seddas, Maryna Viazovska, Emmanuel Abbe, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:14:15Z

**Summary**: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.

**Authors**: Saeid Ario Vaghefi, Aymane Hachcham, Veronica Grasso, Jiska Manicus, Nakiete Msemo, Chiara Colesanti Senni, Markus Leippold

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:11:11Z

**Summary**: Tracking financial investments in climate adaptation is a complex and expertise-intensive task, particularly for Early Warning Systems (EWS), which lack standardized financial reporting across multilateral development banks (MDBs) and funds. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.

### Explainable ICD Coding via Entity Linking
**Authors**: Leonor Barreiros, Isabel Coutinho, Gonçalo M. Correia, Bruno Martins

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:54:13Z

**Summary**: Clinical coding is a critical task in healthcare, although traditional methods for automating clinical coding may not provide sufficient explicit evidence for coders in production environments. This evidence is crucial, as medical coders have to make sure there exists at least one explicit passage in the input health record that justifies the attribution of a code. We therefore propose to reframe the task as an entity linking problem, in which each document is annotated with its set of codes and respective textual evidence, enabling better human-machine collaboration. By leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), together with constrained decoding, we introduce three approaches to solve this problem that prove effective at disambiguating clinical mentions and that perform well in few-shot scenarios.

### Speech-to-Trajectory: Learning Human-Like Verbal Guidance for Robot   Motion
**Authors**: Eran Beeri Bamani, Eden Nissinman, Rotem Atari, Nevo Heimann Saadon, Avishai Sintov

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:54:08Z

**Summary**: Full integration of robots into real-life applications necessitates their ability to interpret and execute natural language directives from untrained users. Given the inherent variability in human language, equivalent directives may be phrased differently, yet require consistent robot behavior. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced language understanding, they often falter in handling user phrasing variability, rely on predefined commands, and exhibit unpredictable outputs. This letter introduces the Directive Language Model (DLM), a novel speech-to-trajectory framework that directly maps verbal commands to executable motion trajectories, bypassing predefined phrases. DLM utilizes Behavior Cloning (BC) on simulated demonstrations of human-guided robot motion. To enhance generalization, GPT-based semantic augmentation generates diverse paraphrases of training commands, labeled with the same motion trajectory. DLM further incorporates a diffusion policy-based trajectory generation for adaptive motion refinement and stochastic sampling. In contrast to LLM-based methods, DLM ensures consistent, predictable motion without extensive prompt engineering, facilitating real-time robotic guidance. As DLM learns from trajectory data, it is embodiment-agnostic, enabling deployment across diverse robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate DLM's improved command generalization, reduced dependence on structured phrasing, and achievement of human-like motion.

### The Curse of CoT: On the Limitations of Chain-of-Thought in In-Context   Learning
**Authors**: Tianshi Zheng, Yixiang Chen, Chengxi Li, Chunyang Li, Qing Zong, Haochen Shi, Baixuan Xu, Yangqiu Song, Ginny Y. Wong, Simon See

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:51:06Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been widely recognized for its ability to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through the generation of explicit explanatory rationales. However, our study reveals a surprising contradiction to this prevailing perspective. Through extensive experiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based in-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning variants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales and benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected phenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical explanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality driving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning falters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from demonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual distance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers despite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative underperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process, even as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes. Notably, even long-CoT reasoning models, which excel in abstract and symbolic reasoning, fail to fully overcome these limitations despite higher computational costs. Our findings challenge existing assumptions regarding the universal efficacy of CoT, yielding novel insights into its limitations and guiding future research toward more nuanced and effective reasoning methodologies for LLMs.

### On the Performance of an Explainable Language Model on PubMedQA
**Authors**: Venkat Srinivasan, Vishaal Jatav, Anushka Chandrababu, Geetika Sharma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:42:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant abilities in retrieving medical knowledge, reasoning over it and answering medical questions comparably to physicians. However, these models are not interpretable, hallucinate, are difficult to maintain and require enormous compute resources for training and inference. In this paper, we report results from Gyan, an explainable language model based on an alternative architecture, on the PubmedQA data set. The Gyan LLM is a compositional language model and the model is decoupled from knowledge. Gyan is trustable, transparent, does not hallucinate and does not require significant training or compute resources. Gyan is easily transferable across domains. Gyan-4.3 achieves SOTA results on PubmedQA with 87.1% accuracy compared to 82% by MedPrompt based on GPT-4 and 81.8% by Med-PaLM 2 (Google and DeepMind). We will be reporting results for other medical data sets - MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU - Medicine in the future.

### Not All Data Are Unlearned Equally
**Authors**: Aravind Krishnan, Siva Reddy, Marius Mosbach

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T08:18:14Z

**Summary**: Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.

### Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Shaohui Mei, Lap-Pui Chau

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:20:17Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

### Debate Only When Necessary: Adaptive Multiagent Collaboration for   Efficient LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Sugyeong Eo, Hyeonseok Moon, Evelyn Hayoon Zi, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:17:52Z

**Summary**: Multiagent collaboration has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While this approach improves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due to iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries that do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration.

### InstructionBench: An Instructional Video Understanding Benchmark
**Authors**: Haiwan Wei, Yitian Yuan, Xiaohan Lan, Wei Ke, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:05:09Z

**Summary**: Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q\&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42\% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q\&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources.

### Explainable AI for Enhancing Efficiency of DL-based Channel Estimation
**Authors**: Abdul Karim Gizzini, Yahia Medjahdi, Ali J. Ghandour, Laurent Clavier

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T13:02:14Z

**Summary**: The support of artificial intelligence (AI) based decision-making is a key element in future 6G networks, where the concept of native AI will be introduced. Moreover, AI is widely employed in different critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based XAI-CHEST framework that is oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. The core idea of the XAI-CHEST framework is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart input feature selection methodology that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework provides valid interpretations, where it offers an improved bit error rate performance while reducing the required computational complexity in comparison to the classical DL-based channel estimation.

### Probabilistic Position-Aided Beam Selection for mmWave MIMO Systems
**Authors**: Joseph K. Chege, Arie Yeredor, Martin Haardt

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:56:51Z

**Summary**: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems rely on highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss and ensure robust communication links. However, selecting the optimal beam pair efficiently remains a challenge due to the large search space and the overhead of conventional methods. This paper proposes a probabilistic position-aided beam selection approach that exploits the statistical dependence between user equipment (UE) positions and optimal beam indices. We model the underlying joint probability mass function (PMF) of the positions and the beam indices as a low-rank tensor and estimate its parameters from training data using Bayesian inference. The estimated model is then used to predict the best (or a list of the top) beam pair indices for new UE positions. The proposed method is evaluated using data generated from a state-of-the-art ray tracing simulator and compared with neural network-based and fingerprinting approaches. The results show that our approach achieves a high data rate with fewer training samples and a significantly reduced beam search space. These advantages render it a promising solution for practical mmWave MIMO deployments, reducing the beam search overhead while maintaining a reliable connectivity.

### Mixture-of-Personas Language Models for Population Simulation
**Authors**: Ngoc Bui, Hieu Trung Nguyen, Shantanu Kumar, Julian Theodore, Weikang Qiu, Viet Anh Nguyen, Rex Ying

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:43:05Z

**Summary**: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) paved the way for their emerging applications in various domains, such as human behavior simulations, where LLMs could augment human-generated data in social science research and machine learning model training. However, pretrained LLMs often fail to capture the behavioral diversity of target populations due to the inherent variability across individuals and groups. To address this, we propose \textit{Mixture of Personas} (MoP), a \textit{probabilistic} prompting method that aligns the LLM responses with the target population. MoP is a contextual mixture model, where each component is an LM agent characterized by a persona and an exemplar representing subpopulation behaviors. The persona and exemplar are randomly chosen according to the learned mixing weights to elicit diverse LLM responses during simulation. MoP is flexible, requires no model finetuning, and is transferable across base models. Experiments for synthetic data generation show that MoP outperforms competing methods in alignment and diversity metrics.

### Joint BS Deployment and Power Optimization for Minimum EMF Exposure with   RL in Real-World Based Urban Scenario
**Authors**: Xueyun Long, Yueheng Li, Mario Pauli, Benjamin Nuss, Thomas Zwick

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:41:08Z

**Summary**: Conventional base station (BS) deployments typically prioritize coverage, quality of service (QoS), or cost reduction, often overlooking electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. Whereas EMF exposure triggers significant public concern due to its potential health implications, making it crucial to address when deploying BS in densely populated areas. To this end, this paper addresses minimizing average EMF exposure while maintaining coverage in a 3D urban scenario by jointly optimizing BS deployment and power. To address this, firstly, accurate EMF prediction is essential, as traditional empirical models lack the required accuracy, necessitating a deterministic channel model. A novel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) algorithm is therefore developed to overcome several limitations of current simulators and is validated with real-world measurements. Secondly, to further reduce computational complexity, unlike using a fixed grid size to discretize the target area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed with a flexible grid to predict the overall EMF exposure. Finally, based on the EMF exposure predictions, the Nelder-Mead (NM) method is used in the joint optimization, and urban user equipment (UE) distributions are incorporated to better reflect real-world conditions. When evaluating the benefits of the whole process, the results are compared against using empirical channel models, revealing notable differences and underestimation of EMF exposure that highlight the importance of considering real-world scenario.

**Authors**: Anastasiia Ivanova, Natalia Fedorova, Sergey Tilga, Ekaterina Artemova

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:35:17Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of AI-driven tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), is reshaping professional writing. Still, key aspects of their adoption such as languages support, ethics, and long-term impact on writers voice and creativity remain underexplored. In this work, we conducted a questionnaire (N = 301) and an interactive survey (N = 36) targeting professional writers regularly using AI. We examined LLM-assisted writing practices across 25+ languages, ethical concerns, and user expectations. The findings of the survey demonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs adoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and style adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide further development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.

### Enhancing Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection in DApps Leveraging   Fine-Tuned LLM
**Authors**: Jiuyang Bu, Wenkai Li, Zongwei Li, Zeng Zhang, Xiaoqi Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:32:14Z

**Summary**: Decentralized applications (DApps) face significant security risks due to vulnerabilities in smart contracts, with traditional detection methods struggling to address emerging and machine-unauditable flaws. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance smart contract vulnerability detection. We introduce a comprehensive dataset of 215 real-world DApp projects (4,998 contracts), including hard-to-detect logical errors like token price manipulation, addressing the limitations of existing simplified benchmarks. By fine-tuning LLMs (Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B) with Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), our method achieves superior performance, attaining an F1-score of 0.83 with FFT and data augmentation via Random Over Sampling (ROS). Comparative experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prompt-based LLMs and state-of-the-art tools. Notably, the approach excels in detecting non-machine-auditable vulnerabilities, achieving 0.97 precision and 0.68 recall for price manipulation flaws. The results underscore the effectiveness of domain-specific LLM fine-tuning and data augmentation in addressing real-world DApp security challenges, offering a robust solution for blockchain ecosystem protection.

### Following the Whispers of Values: Unraveling Neural Mechanisms Behind   Value-Oriented Behaviors in LLMs
**Authors**: Ling Hu, Yuemei Xu, Xiaoyang Gu, Letao Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:23:59Z

**Summary**: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), they can present unintended biases and harmful behaviors driven by encoded values, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the value mechanisms behind them. However, current research primarily evaluates these values through external responses with a focus on AI safety, lacking interpretability and failing to assess social values in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven mechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case study, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a large-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social Values in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons responsible for encoding these values according to activation difference. Finally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior, uncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM decision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the efficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.

### On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency   and Model Performance
**Authors**: Jaskirat Singh, Emad Fallahzadeh, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:16:27Z

**Summary**: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.

**Authors**: Giulio Starace, Oliver Jaffe, Dane Sherburn, James Aung, Jun Shern Chan, Leon Maksin, Rachel Dias, Evan Mays, Benjamin Kinsella, Wyatt Thompson, Johannes Heidecke, Amelia Glaese, Tejal Patwardhan

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:15:49Z

**Summary**: We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We open-source our code (https://github.com/openai/preparedness) to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.

### A Domain-Based Taxonomy of Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Carlos Peláez-González, Andrés Herrera-Poyatos, Cristina Zuheros, David Herrera-Poyatos, Virilo Tejedor, Francisco Herrera

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:05:16Z

**Summary**: The study of large language models (LLMs) is a key area in open-world machine learning. Although LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language processing capabilities, they also face several challenges, including consistency issues, hallucinations, and jailbreak vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking refers to the crafting of prompts that bypass alignment safeguards, leading to unsafe outputs that compromise the integrity of LLMs. This work specifically focuses on the challenge of jailbreak vulnerabilities and introduces a novel taxonomy of jailbreak attacks grounded in the training domains of LLMs. It characterizes alignment failures through generalization, objectives, and robustness gaps. Our primary contribution is a perspective on jailbreak, framed through the different linguistic domains that emerge during LLM training and alignment. This viewpoint highlights the limitations of existing approaches and enables us to classify jailbreak attacks on the basis of the underlying model deficiencies they exploit. Unlike conventional classifications that categorize attacks based on prompt construction methods (e.g., prompt templating), our approach provides a deeper understanding of LLM behavior. We introduce a taxonomy with four categories -- mismatched generalization, competing objectives, adversarial robustness, and mixed attacks -- offering insights into the fundamental nature of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Finally, we present key lessons derived from this taxonomic study.

### Towards Visual Text Grounding of Multimodal Large Language Model
**Authors**: Ming Li, Ruiyi Zhang, Jian Chen, Jiuxiang Gu, Yufan Zhou, Franck Dernoncourt, Wanrong Zhu, Tianyi Zhou, Tong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T12:01:59Z

**Summary**: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.

**Summary**: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports various BI tasks for different data roles in data preparation, analysis, and visualization by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.

### The Dream Within Huang Long Cave: AI-Driven Interactive Narrative for   Family Storytelling and Emotional Reflection
**Authors**: Jiayang Huang, Lingjie Li, Kang Zhang, David Yip

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:54:11Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces the art project The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, an AI-driven interactive and immersive narrative experience. The project offers new insights into AI technology, artistic practice, and psychoanalysis. Inspired by actual geographical landscapes and familial archetypes, the work combines psychoanalytic theory and computational technology, providing an artistic response to the concept of the non-existence of the Big Other. The narrative is driven by a combination of a large language model (LLM) and a realistic digital character, forming a virtual agent named YELL. Through dialogue and exploration within a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE), the audience is invited to unravel the language puzzles presented by YELL and help him overcome his life challenges. YELL is a fictional embodiment of the Big Other, modeled after the artist's real father. Through a cross-temporal interaction with this digital father, the project seeks to deconstruct complex familial relationships. By demonstrating the non-existence of the Big Other, we aim to underscore the authenticity of interpersonal emotions, positioning art as a bridge for emotional connection and understanding within family dynamics.

### M-Prometheus: A Suite of Open Multilingual LLM Judges
**Authors**: José Pombal, Dongkeun Yoon, Patrick Fernandes, Ian Wu, Seungone Kim, Ricardo Rei, Graham Neubig, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:37:26Z

**Summary**: The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on natively multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.

### A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward   Modeling and Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Wenyuan Xu, Xiaochen Zuo, Chao Xin, Yu Yue, Lin Yan, Yonghui Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:34:48Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.

### A Llama walks into the 'Bar': Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning for Legal   Reasoning in the Multi-state Bar Exam
**Authors**: Rean Fernandes, André Biedenkapp, Frank Hutter, Noor Awad

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:31:22Z

**Summary**: Legal reasoning tasks present unique challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to the complexity of domain-specific knowledge and reasoning processes. This paper investigates how effectively smaller language models (Llama 2 7B and Llama 3 8B) can be fine-tuned with a limited dataset of 1,514 Multi-state Bar Examination (MBE) questions to improve legal question answering accuracy. We evaluate these models on the 2022 MBE questions licensed from JD Advising, the same dataset used in the 'GPT-4 passes the Bar exam' study. Our methodology involves collecting approximately 200 questions per legal domain across 7 domains. We distill the dataset using Llama 3 (70B) to transform explanations into a structured IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) format as a guided reasoning process to see if it results in better performance over the non-distilled dataset. We compare the non-fine-tuned models against their supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts, trained for different sample sizes per domain, to study the effect on accuracy and prompt adherence. We also analyse option selection biases and their mitigation following SFT. In addition, we consolidate the performance across multiple variables: prompt type (few-shot vs zero-shot), answer ordering (chosen-option first vs generated-explanation first), response format (Numbered list vs Markdown vs JSON), and different decoding temperatures. Our findings show that domain-specific SFT helps some model configurations achieve close to human baseline performance, despite limited computational resources and a relatively small dataset. We release both the gathered SFT dataset and the family of Supervised Fine-tuned (SFT) adapters optimised for MBE performance. This establishes a practical lower bound on resources needed towards achieving effective legal question answering in smaller LLMs.

### Lemmanaid: Neuro-Symbolic Lemma Conjecturing
**Authors**: Yousef Alhessi, Sólrún Halla Einarsdóttir, George Granberry, Emily First, Moa Johansson, Sorin Lerner, Nicholas Smallbone

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:30:36Z

**Summary**: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Our results indicate that neural and symbolic techniques are complementary. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.

### VidCtx: Context-aware Video Question Answering with Image Models
**Authors**: Andreas Goulas, Vasileios Mezaris, Ioannis Patras

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:20:37Z

**Summary**: To address computational and memory limitations of Large Multimodal Models in the Video Question-Answering task, several recent methods extract textual representations per frame (e.g., by captioning) and feed them to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes them to produce the final response. However, in this way, the LLM does not have access to visual information and often has to process repetitive textual descriptions of nearby frames. To address those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel training-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both visual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames that give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular intervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames. Those will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the question at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the context/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we chose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet effective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions. This methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the video and scale to a high number of frames. Experiments show that VidCtx achieves competitive performance among approaches that rely on open models on three public Video QA benchmarks, NExT-QA, IntentQA and STAR. Our code is available at https://github.com/IDT-ITI/VidCtx.

### Learning to Adapt through Bio-Inspired Gait Strategies for Versatile   Quadruped Locomotion
**Authors**: Joseph Humphreys, Chengxu Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T11:03:13Z

**Summary**: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionised quadruped robot locomotion, but existing control frameworks struggle to generalise beyond their training-induced observational scope, resulting in limited adaptability and gait proficiency. In contrast, animals achieve exceptional adaptability through gait transition strategies, diverse gait utilisation, and seamless adjustment to immediate environmental demands. Inspired by these capabilities, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates key attributes of animal locomotion: gait transition strategies, pseudo gait procedural memory, and adaptive motion adjustments. This approach enables our framework to achieve unparalleled adaptability, demonstrated through blind zero-shot deployment on complex terrains and recovery from critically unstable states. Our findings offer valuable insights into the biomechanics of animal locomotion, paving the way for robust, adaptable robotic systems.

### AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM   Agents
**Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Christopher M. Poskitt, Jun Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:57:45Z

**Summary**: Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:57:40Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.

### Collab-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Complex Question   Answering via White-Box and Black-Box LLM Collaboration
**Authors**: Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Joyce C. Ho, Haoyu Wang, Carl Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:52:22Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle to handle multi-hop question-answering tasks accurately due to irrelevant context retrieval and limited complex reasoning capabilities. We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a blackbox large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions. The code of Collab-RAG is available on https://github.com/ritaranx/Collab-RAG/.

### DeepResearcher: Scaling Deep Research via Reinforcement Learning in   Real-world Environments
**Authors**: Yuxiang Zheng, Dayuan Fu, Xiangkun Hu, Xiaojie Cai, Lyumanshan Ye, Pengrui Lu, Pengfei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:45:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications. We release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.

### Cloud-Fog Automation: The New Paradigm towards Autonomous Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Jiong Jin, Zhibo Pang, Jonathan Kua, Quanyan Zhu, Karl H. Johansson, Nikolaj Marchenko, Dave Cavalcanti

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:36:26Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) represent a future vision where industrial systems achieve full autonomy, integrating physical processes seamlessly with communication, computing and control technologies while holistically embedding intelligence. Cloud-Fog Automation is a new digitalized industrial automation reference architecture that has been recently proposed. This architecture is a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 model to accelerate the convergence and synergy of communication, computing, and control towards a fully autonomous ICPS. With the deployment of new wireless technologies to enable almost-deterministic ultra-reliable low-latency communications, a joint design of optimal control and computing has become increasingly important in modern ICPS. It is also imperative that system-wide cyber-physical security are critically enforced. Despite recent advancements in the field, there are still significant research gaps and open technical challenges. Therefore, a deliberate rethink in co-designing and synergizing communications, computing, and control (which we term "3C co-design") is required. In this paper, we position Cloud-Fog Automation with 3C co-design as the new paradigm to realize the vision of autonomous ICPS. We articulate the state-of-the-art and future directions in the field, and specifically discuss how goal-oriented communication, virtualization-empowered computing, and Quality of Service (QoS)-aware control can drive Cloud-Fog Automation towards a fully autonomous ICPS, while accounting for system-wide cyber-physical security.

**Authors**: Hui Han, Siyuan Li, Jiaqi Chen, Yiwen Yuan, Yuling Wu, Chak Tou Leong, Hanwen Du, Junchen Fu, Youhua Li, Jie Zhang, Chi Zhang, Li-jia Li, Yongxin Ni

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:32:42Z

**Summary**: Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.

### SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Justus Westerhoff, Erblina Purellku, Jakob Hackstein, Leo Pinetzki, Lorenz Hufe

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T10:01:38Z

**Summary**: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper under https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLISS-e-V/SCAM, along with the code for evaluations at https://github.com/Bliss-e-V/SCAM.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Cost-Effective, Multilingual   Depression Detection and Severity Assessment
**Authors**: Longdi Xian, Jianzhang Ni, Mingzhu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:58:19Z

**Summary**: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that is difficult to detect early due to subjective symptom assessments. Recent advancements in large language models have offered efficient and cost-effective approaches for this objective. In this study, we evaluated the performance of four LLMs in depression detection using clinical interview data. We selected the best performing model and further tested it in the severity evaluation scenario and knowledge enhanced scenario. The robustness was evaluated in complex diagnostic scenarios using a dataset comprising 51074 statements from six different mental disorders. We found that DeepSeek V3 is the most reliable and cost-effective model for depression detection, performing well in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, with zero-shot being the most efficient choice. The evaluation of severity showed low agreement with the human evaluator, particularly for mild depression. The model maintains stably high AUCs for detecting depression in complex diagnostic scenarios. These findings highlight DeepSeek V3s strong potential for text-based depression detection in real-world clinical applications. However, they also underscore the need for further refinement in severity assessment and the mitigation of potential biases to enhance clinical reliability.

### SoK: LLM-based Log Parsing
**Authors**: Viktor Beck, Max Landauer, Markus Wurzenberger, Florian Skopik, Andreas Rauber

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:41:04Z

**Summary**: Log data, generated by software systems, provides crucial insights for tasks like monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection. Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.

### Simulating Persuasive Dialogues on Meat Reduction with Generative Agents
**Authors**: Georg Ahnert, Elena Wurth, Markus Strohmaier, Jutta Mata

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:27:37Z

**Summary**: Meat reduction benefits human and planetary health, but social norms keep meat central in shared meals. To date, the development of communication strategies that promote meat reduction while minimizing social costs has required the costly involvement of human participants at each stage of the process. We present work in progress on simulating multi-round dialogues on meat reduction between Generative Agents based on large language models (LLMs). We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based models are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on meat reduction-tailored to highly specific participant groups-to then be tested in subsequent studies with human participants.

### Don't Lag, RAG: Training-Free Adversarial Detection Using RAG
**Authors**: Roie Kazoom, Raz Lapid, Moshe Sipper, Ofer Hadar

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:14:47Z

**Summary**: Adversarial patch attacks pose a major threat to vision systems by embedding localized perturbations that mislead deep models. Traditional defense methods often require retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for real-world deployment. We propose a training-free Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adversarial patch detection. By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model. Notably, the open-source UI-TARS-72B-DPO model achieves up to 95 percent classification accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source adversarial patch detection. Gemini-2.0 attains the highest overall accuracy, 98 percent, but remains closed-source. Experimental results demonstrate VRAG's effectiveness in identifying a variety of adversarial patches with minimal human annotation, paving the way for robust, practical defenses against evolving adversarial patch attacks.

**Authors**: Haoxuan Li, Mingyu Derek Ma, Jen-tse Huang, Zhaotian Weng, Wei Wang, Jieyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T09:12:00Z

**Summary**: Detecting biases in structured data is a complex and time-consuming task. Existing automated techniques are limited in diversity of data types and heavily reliant on human case-by-case handling, resulting in a lack of generalizability. Currently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have made significant progress in data science, but their ability to detect data biases is still insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the first end-to-end, multi-agent synergy framework, BIASINSPECTOR, designed for automatic bias detection in structured data based on specific user requirements. It first develops a multi-stage plan to analyze user-specified bias detection tasks and then implements it with a diverse and well-suited set of tools. It delivers detailed results that include explanations and visualizations. To address the lack of a standardized framework for evaluating the capability of LLM agents to detect biases in data, we further propose a comprehensive benchmark that includes multiple evaluation metrics and a large set of test cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves exceptional overall performance in structured data bias detection, setting a new milestone for fairer data applications.

**Authors**: Qingpei Guo, Kaiyou Song, Zipeng Feng, Ziping Ma, Qinglong Zhang, Sirui Gao, Xuzheng Yu, Yunxiao Sun, Tai-Wei Chang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:54:28Z

**Summary**: We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.

### Towards Benchmarking and Assessing the Safety and Robustness of   Autonomous Driving on Safety-critical Scenarios
**Authors**: Jingzheng Li, Xianglong Liu, Shikui Wei, Zhijun Chen, Bing Li, Qing Guo, Xianqi Yang, Yanjun Pu, Jiakai Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:26:00Z

**Summary**: Autonomous driving has made significant progress in both academia and industry, including performance improvements in perception task and the development of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the safety and robustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient attention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in natural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases, also known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are difficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what constitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and robustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we provide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic scenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts, as well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we develop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively evaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of perception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically constructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing technical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and reduce risks in real-world road deployment.

### From Prompts to Templates: A Systematic Prompt Template Analysis for   Real-world LLMapps
**Authors**: Yuetian Mao, Junjie He, Chunyang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:25:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-AI interaction by enabling intuitive task execution through natural language prompts. Despite their potential, designing effective prompts remains a significant challenge, as small variations in structure or wording can result in substantial differences in output. To address these challenges, LLM-powered applications (LLMapps) rely on prompt templates to simplify interactions, enhance usability, and support specialized tasks such as document analysis, creative content generation, and code synthesis. However, current practices heavily depend on individual expertise and iterative trial-and-error processes, underscoring the need for systematic methods to optimize prompt template design in LLMapps. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of prompt templates in practical LLMapps. We construct a dataset of real-world templates from open-source LLMapps, including those from leading companies like Uber and Microsoft. Through a combination of LLM-driven analysis and human review, we categorize template components and placeholders, analyze their distributions, and identify frequent co-occurrence patterns. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of identified patterns on LLMs' instruction-following performance through sample testing. Our findings provide practical insights on prompt template design for developers, supporting the broader adoption and optimization of LLMapps in industrial settings.

### Beyond Answers: How LLMs Can Pursue Strategic Thinking in Education
**Authors**: Eleonora Grassucci, Gualtiero Grassucci, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:09:46Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential in education, enabling personalized learning, enhancing inclusivity, and encouraging creativity and curiosity. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as both patient tutors and collaborative partners to enhance education delivery. As tutors, LLMs personalize learning by offering step-by-step explanations and addressing individual needs, making education more inclusive for students with diverse backgrounds or abilities. As collaborators, they expand students' horizons, supporting them in tackling complex, real-world problems and co-creating innovative projects. However, to fully realize these benefits, LLMs must be leveraged not as tools for providing direct solutions but rather to guide students in developing resolving strategies and finding learning paths together. Therefore, a strong emphasis should be placed on educating students and teachers on the successful use of LLMs to ensure their effective integration into classrooms. Through practical examples and real-world case studies, this paper illustrates how LLMs can make education more inclusive and engaging while empowering students to reach their full potential.

### PiCo: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via   $\textbf{Pi}$ctorial $\textbf{Co}$de Contextualization
**Authors**: Aofan Liu, Lulu Tang, Ting Pan, Yuguo Yin, Bin Wang, Ao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:05:25Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI capabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.

### Select Me! When You Need a Tool: A Black-box Text Attack on Tool   Selection
**Authors**: Liuji Chen, Hao Gao, Jinghao Zhang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:04:23Z

**Summary**: Tool learning serves as a powerful auxiliary mechanism that extends the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle complex tasks requiring real-time relevance or high precision operations. Behind its powerful capabilities lie some potential security issues. However, previous work has primarily focused on how to make the output of the invoked tools incorrect or malicious, with little attention given to the manipulation of tool selection. To fill this gap, we introduce, for the first time, a black-box text-based attack that can significantly increase the probability of the target tool being selected in this paper. We propose a two-level text perturbation attack witha coarse-to-fine granularity, attacking the text at both the word level and the character level. We conduct comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the attacker only needs to make some perturbations to the tool's textual information to significantly increase the possibility of the target tool being selected and ranked higher among the candidate tools. Our research reveals the vulnerability of the tool selection process and paves the way for future research on protecting this process.

### ELT-Bench: An End-to-End Benchmark for Evaluating AI Agents on ELT   Pipelines
**Authors**: Tengjun Jin, Yuxuan Zhu, Daniel Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:03:36Z

**Summary**: Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses. However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness. Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines. Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.   To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines. ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains. By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows. AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage. We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/ETL.git.

### S-Eval: Towards Automated and Comprehensive Safety Evaluation for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Yuan, Jinfeng Li, Dongxia Wang, Yuefeng Chen, Xiaofeng Mao, Longtao Huang, Jialuo Chen, Hui Xue, Xiaoxia Liu, Wenhai Wang, Kui Ren, Jingyi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:52:28Z

**Summary**: Generative large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their transformative and emergent capabilities. However, recent evidence indicates that LLMs can produce harmful content that violates social norms, raising significant concerns regarding the safety and ethical ramifications of deploying these advanced models. Thus, it is both critical and imperative to perform a rigorous and comprehensive safety evaluation of LLMs before deployment. Despite this need, owing to the extensiveness of LLM generation space, it still lacks a unified and standardized risk taxonomy to systematically reflect the LLM content safety, as well as automated safety assessment techniques to explore the potential risk efficiently.   To bridge the striking gap, we propose S-Eval, a novel LLM-based automated Safety Evaluation framework with a newly defined comprehensive risk taxonomy. S-Eval incorporates two key components, i.e., an expert testing LLM ${M}_t$ and a novel safety critique LLM ${M}_c$. ${M}_t$ is responsible for automatically generating test cases in accordance with the proposed risk taxonomy. ${M}_c$ can provide quantitative and explainable safety evaluations for better risk awareness of LLMs. In contrast to prior works, S-Eval is efficient and effective in test generation and safety evaluation. Moreover, S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanying new safety threats, test generation methods and safety critique methods thanks to the LLM-based architecture. S-Eval has been deployed in our industrial partner for the automated safety evaluation of multiple LLMs serving millions of users, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/IS2Lab/S-Eval.

### Large Language Models are In-Context Molecule Learners
**Authors**: Jiatong Li, Wei Liu, Zhihao Ding, Wenqi Fan, Yuqiang Li, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:46:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve similar informative context examples. Additionally, Post-retrieval Re-ranking is composed of Sequence Reversal and Random Walk selection to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context learning and reasoning capability of LLMs with the retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for better alignment between molecules and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMA can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.

### MegaScale-Infer: Serving Mixture-of-Experts at Scale with Disaggregated   Expert Parallelism

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:42:30Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) showcases tremendous potential to scale large language models (LLMs) with enhanced performance and reduced computational complexity. However, its sparsely activated architecture shifts feed-forward networks (FFNs) from being compute-intensive to memory-intensive during inference, leading to substantially lower GPU utilization and increased operational costs. We present MegaScale-Infer, an efficient and cost-effective system for serving large-scale MoE models. MegaScale-Infer disaggregates attention and FFN modules within each model layer, enabling independent scaling, tailored parallelism strategies, and heterogeneous deployment for both modules. To fully exploit disaggregation in the presence of MoE's sparsity, MegaScale-Infer introduces ping-pong pipeline parallelism, which partitions a request batch into micro-batches and shuttles them between attention and FFNs for inference. Combined with distinct model parallelism for each module, MegaScale-Infer effectively hides communication overhead and maximizes GPU utilization. To adapt to disaggregated attention and FFN modules and minimize data transmission overhead (e.g., token dispatch), MegaScale-Infer provides a high-performance M2N communication library that eliminates unnecessary GPU-to-CPU data copies, group initialization overhead, and GPU synchronization. Experimental results indicate that MegaScale-Infer achieves up to 1.90x higher per-GPU throughput than state-of-the-art solutions.

### Weak-for-Strong: Training Weak Meta-Agent to Harness Strong Executors
**Authors**: Fan Nie, Lan Feng, Haotian Ye, Weixin Liang, Pan Lu, Huaxiu Yao, Alexandre Alahi, James Zou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:27:31Z

**Summary**: Efficiently leveraging of the capabilities of contemporary large language models (LLMs) is increasingly challenging, particularly when direct fine-tuning is expensive and often impractical. Existing training-free methods, including manually or automated designed workflows, typically demand substantial human effort or yield suboptimal results. This paper proposes Weak-for-Strong Harnessing (W4S), a novel framework that customizes smaller, cost-efficient language models to design and optimize workflows for harnessing stronger models. W4S formulates workflow design as a multi-turn markov decision process and introduces reinforcement learning for agentic workflow optimization (RLAO) to train a weak meta-agent. Through iterative interaction with the environment, the meta-agent learns to design increasingly effective workflows without manual intervention. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of W4S that our 7B meta-agent, trained with just one GPU hour, outperforms the strongest baseline by 2.9% ~ 24.6% across eleven benchmarks, successfully elevating the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. Notably, W4S exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both seen and unseen tasks, offering an efficient, high-performing alternative to directly fine-tuning strong models.

### Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security
**Authors**: Shen Li, Liuyi Yao, Lan Zhang, Yaliang Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:23:33Z

**Summary**: Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.

### A Zero-shot Learning Method Based on Large Language Models for   Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding
**Authors**: Bingchen Liu, Jingchen Li, Yuanyuan Fang, Xin Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:22:25Z

**Summary**: Zero-shot learning (ZL) is crucial for tasks involving unseen categories, such as natural language processing, image classification, and cross-lingual transfer.Current applications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations orentities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and prac-ticality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectivelytransferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledgegraph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we proposeZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using largelanguage models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseencategories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enablingsemantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories.Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen cate-gories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiplereal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared tostate-of-the-art methods.

### Feature Coding in the Era of Large Models: Dataset, Test Conditions, and   Benchmark
**Authors**: Changsheng Gao, Yifan Ma, Qiaoxi Chen, Yenan Xu, Dong Liu, Weisi Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:22:06Z

**Summary**: Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment. All source code and the dataset are now available at \href{https://github.com/chansongoal/FCM-LM/tree/master}{https://github.com/chansongoal/FCM-LM/tree/master}.

### Benchmarking Multi-modal Semantic Segmentation under Sensor Failures:   Missing and Noisy Modality Robustness
**Authors**: Chenfei Liao, Kaiyu Lei, Xu Zheng, Junha Moon, Zhixiong Wang, Yixuan Wang, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T07:00:07Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) addresses the limitations of single-modality data by integrating complementary information across modalities. Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field.

### Demystifying Issues, Causes and Solutions in LLM Open-Source Projects
**Authors**: Yangxiao Cai, Peng Liang, Yifei Wang, Zengyang Li, Mojtaba Shahin

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:57:06Z

**Summary**: With the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of open-source software projects are using LLMs as their core functional component. Although research and practice on LLMs are capturing considerable interest, no dedicated studies explored the challenges faced by practitioners of LLM open-source projects, the causes of these challenges, and potential solutions. To fill this research gap, we conducted an empirical study to understand the issues that practitioners encounter when developing and using LLM open-source software, the possible causes of these issues, and potential solutions. We collected all closed issues from 15 LLM open-source projects and labelled issues that met our requirements. We then randomly selected 994 issues from the labelled issues as the sample for data extraction and analysis to understand the prevalent issues, their underlying causes, and potential solutions. Our study results show that (1) Model Issue is the most common issue faced by practitioners, (2) Model Problem, Configuration and Connection Problem, and Feature and Method Problem are identified as the most frequent causes of the issues, and (3) Optimize Model is the predominant solution to the issues. Based on the study results, we provide implications for practitioners and researchers of LLM open-source projects.

### Improving Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Language Models through   Dialectic Reasoning Argumentations
**Authors**: Leonardo Ranaldi, Federico Ranaldi, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:55:15Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is key to enhancing large language models (LLMs) to systematically access richer factual knowledge. Yet, using RAG brings intrinsic challenges, as LLMs must deal with potentially conflicting knowledge, especially in multilingual retrieval, where the heterogeneity of knowledge retrieved may deliver different outlooks. To make RAG more analytical, critical and grounded, we introduce Dialectic-RAG (DRAG), a modular approach guided by Argumentative Explanations, i.e., structured reasoning process that systematically evaluates retrieved   information by comparing, contrasting, and resolving conflicting perspectives. Given a query and a set of multilingual related documents, DRAG selects and exemplifies relevant knowledge for delivering dialectic explanations that, by critically weighing opposing arguments and filtering extraneous content, clearly determine the final response. Through a series of in-depth experiments, we show the impact of our framework both as an in-context learning strategy and for constructing demonstrations to instruct smaller models. The final results demonstrate that DRAG significantly improves RAG approaches, requiring low-impact computational effort and providing robustness to knowledge perturbations.

**Summary**: Pre-training large language models (LLMs) necessitates enormous diverse textual corpora, making effective data selection a key challenge for balancing computational resources and model performance. Current methodologies primarily emphasize data quality metrics and mixing proportions, yet they fail to adequately capture the underlying semantic connections between training samples and quality disparities within individual domains. We introduce ToReMi (Topic-based Reweighting for Model improvement), a novel two-stage framework that dynamically adjusts training sample weights according to their topical associations and observed learning patterns. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that ToReMi variants consistently achieve superior performance over conventional pre-training approaches, demonstrating accelerated perplexity reduction across multiple domains and enhanced capabilities on downstream evaluation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/zxx000728/ToReMi.

### Prompt Categories Cluster for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Wangyu Wu, Xianglin Qiu, Siqi Song, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:29:48Z

**Summary**: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which leverages image-level labels, has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness. The previous methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class semantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they overlook the positive function of some shared information between similar classes. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features. Allowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic ambiguity between these classes. To effectively identify and utilize this shared information, in this paper, we introduce a novel WSSS framework called Prompt Categories Clustering (PCC). Specifically, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters through prompts. These clusters effectively represent the intrinsic relationships between categories. By integrating this relational information into the training network, our model is able to better learn the hidden connections between categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its ability to enhance performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

### Direct Preference Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yixing Li, Yuxian Gu, Li Dong, Dequan Wang, Yu Cheng, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:11:54Z

**Summary**: In the field of large language models (LLMs), Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a critical technique for transferring capabilities from teacher models to student models. However, existing KD methods face limitations and challenges in distillation of LLMs, including efficiency and insufficient measurement capabilities of traditional KL divergence. It is shown that LLMs can serve as an implicit reward function, which we define as a supplement to KL divergence. In this work, we propose Direct Preference Knowledge Distillation (DPKD) for LLMs. DPKD utilizes distribution divergence to represent the preference loss and implicit reward function. We re-formulate KD of LLMs into two stages: first optimizing and objective consisting of implicit reward and reverse KL divergence and then improving the preference probability of teacher outputs over student outputs. We conducted experiments and analysis on various datasets with LLM parameters ranging from 120M to 13B and demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our DPKD approach. Meanwhile, we prove the value and effectiveness of the introduced implicit reward and output preference in KD through experiments and theoretical analysis. The DPKD method outperforms the baseline method in both output response precision and exact match percentage. Code and data are available at https://aka.ms/dpkd.

### Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for   Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission
**Authors**: Hansung Choi, Daewon Seo

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:11:39Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have significantly improved communication performance, but their high computational demands restrict practical deployment. Furthermore, some applications require the adaptive adjustment of computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient and adjustable deepJSCC model for image transmission, which we call feature importance-aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC). Unlike existing deepJSCC models that equally process all neural features of images, FAJSCC first classifies features into important and less important features and then processes them differently. Specifically, computationally-intensive self-attention is applied to the important features and computationally-efficient spatial attention to the less important ones. The feature classification is based on the available computational budget and importance scores predicted by an importance predictor, which estimates each feature's contribution to performance. It also allows independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. With these properties, our FAJSCC is the first deepJSCC that is computationally efficient and adjustable while maintaining high performance. Experiments demonstrate that our FAJSCC achieves higher image transmission performance across various channel conditions while using less computational complexity than the recent state-of-the-art models. Adding to this, by separately varying the computational resources of the encoder and decoder, it is concluded that the decoder's error correction function requires the largest computational complexity in FAJSCC, which is the first observation in deepJSCC literature. The FAJSCC code is publicly available at https://github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCC.

### Two is Better than One: Efficient Ensemble Defense for Robust and   Compact Models
**Authors**: Yoojin Jung, Byung Cheol Song

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T05:41:35Z

**Summary**: Deep learning-based computer vision systems adopt complex and large architectures to improve performance, yet they face challenges in deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. To address this issue, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and matrix factorization have been proposed; however, these compressed models are often highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We introduce the \textbf{Efficient Ensemble Defense (EED)} technique, which diversifies the compression of a single base model based on different pruning importance scores and enhances ensemble diversity to achieve high adversarial robustness and resource efficiency. EED dynamically determines the number of necessary sub-models during the inference stage, minimizing unnecessary computations while maintaining high robustness. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, EED demonstrated state-of-the-art robustness performance compared to existing adversarial pruning techniques, along with an inference speed improvement of up to 1.86 times. This proves that EED is a powerful defense solution in resource-constrained environments.

### Can LLMs Interpret and Leverage Structured Linguistic Representations? A   Case Study with AMRs
**Authors**: Ankush Raut, Xiaofeng Zhu, Maria Leonor Pacheco

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T05:38:40Z

**Summary**: This paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage contextual information in the form of structured linguistic representations. Specifically, we examine the impact of encoding both short and long contexts using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structures across a diverse set of language tasks. We perform our analysis using 8-bit quantized and instruction-tuned versions of Llama 3.1 (8B), Phi-3, and Mistral 7B. Our results indicate that, for tasks involving short contexts, augmenting the prompt with the AMR of the original language context often degrades the performance of the underlying LLM. However, for tasks that involve long contexts, such as dialogue summarization in the SAMSum dataset, this enhancement improves LLM performance, for example, by increasing the zero-shot cosine similarity score of Llama 3.1 from 66.2% to 76%. This improvement is more evident in the newer and larger LLMs, but does not extend to the older or smaller ones. In addition, we observe that LLMs can effectively reconstruct the original text from a linearized AMR, achieving a cosine similarity of 81.3% in the best-case scenario.
