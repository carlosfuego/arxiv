**Authors**: Yunqi Guo, Kaiyuan Hou, Heming Fu, Hongkai Chen, Zhenyu Yan, Guoliang Xing, Xiaofan Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:56:01Z

**Summary**: Understanding sensor data can be difficult for non-experts because of the complexity and different semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This leads to a need for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we propose Vivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately reflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor variations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 503 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

**Summary**: We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.

### Integrating Prefetcher Selection with Dynamic Request Allocation   Improves Prefetching Efficiency
**Authors**: Mengming Li, Qijun Zhang, Yongqing Ren, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T06:45:13Z

**Summary**: Hardware prefetching plays a critical role in hiding the off-chip DRAM latency. The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory access patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching algorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these algorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since these prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing prefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under such circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed to mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions suffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is inaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.   In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and widely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the demand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to Alecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for training and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only harmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also significantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital for temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based prefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in eight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by 5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling various types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement, Alecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the prefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage overhead.

**Authors**: Insu Han, Zeliang Zhang, Zhiyuan Wang, Yifan Zhu, Susan Liang, Jiani Liu, Haiting Lin, Mingjie Zhao, Chenliang Xu, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T23:47:51Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse applications. However, their computational overhead during deployment remains a critical bottleneck. While Key-Value (KV) caching effectively trades memory for computation to enhance inference efficiency, the growing memory footprint from extensive KV caches significantly reduces throughput and restricts prolonged deployment on memory-constrained GPU devices. To address this challenge, we propose CalibQuant, a simple yet highly effective visual quantization strategy that drastically reduces both memory and computational overhead. Specifically, CalibQuant introduces an extreme 1-bit quantization scheme, complemented by novel post-scaling and calibration techniques tailored to the intrinsic patterns of KV caches, thereby ensuring high efficiency without compromising model performance. Leveraging Triton for runtime optimization, we achieve a 10x throughput increase on InternVL models. Our method is designed to be plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating with various existing MLLMs without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving multimodal capabilities. Codes are available at https://github.com/insuhan/calibquant.

### Skew-Symmetric Matrix Decompositions on Shared-Memory Architectures
**Authors**: Ishna Satyarth, Chao Yin, Devin A. Matthews, Maggie Myers, Robert van de Geijn, RuQing G. Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T21:27:53Z

**Summary**: The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra, particularly in comparison to that of general and symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. This work examines the factorization of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$ into its $LTL^\mathrm{T}$ decomposition, where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $T$ is tridiagonal. This is also known as a triangular tridiagonalization. This operation is a means for computing the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$ as well as for solving systems of equations, across fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Its application also often requires pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. We compare and contrast previously-published algorithms with those systematically derived using the FLAME methodology. Performant parallel CPU implementations are achieved by fusing operations at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead. A key factor is the employment of new capabilities of the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework, which now supports casting level-2 and level-3 BLAS-like operations by leveraging its gemm and other kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. A prototype, concise C++ API facilitates the translation of correct-by-construction algorithms into correct code. Experiments verify that the resulting implementations greatly exceed the performance of previous work.

### Compositional Caching for Training-free Open-vocabulary Attribute   Detection
**Authors**: Marco Garosi, Alessandro Conti, Gaowen Liu, Elisa Ricci, Massimiliano Mancini

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T21:00:37Z

**Summary**: Attribute detection is crucial for many computer vision tasks, as it enables systems to describe properties such as color, texture, and material. Current approaches often rely on labor-intensive annotation processes which are inherently limited: objects can be described at an arbitrary level of detail (e.g., color vs. color shades), leading to ambiguities when the annotators are not instructed carefully. Furthermore, they operate within a predefined set of attributes, reducing scalability and adaptability to unforeseen downstream applications. We present Compositional Caching (ComCa), a training-free method for open-vocabulary attribute detection that overcomes these constraints. ComCa requires only the list of target attributes and objects as input, using them to populate an auxiliary cache of images by leveraging web-scale databases and Large Language Models to determine attribute-object compatibility. To account for the compositional nature of attributes, cache images receive soft attribute labels. Those are aggregated at inference time based on the similarity between the input and cache images, refining the predictions of underlying Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Importantly, our approach is model-agnostic, compatible with various VLMs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ComCa significantly outperforms zero-shot and cache-based baselines, competing with recent training-based methods, proving that a carefully designed training-free approach can successfully address open-vocabulary attribute detection.

### Mitigating KV Cache Competition to Enhance User Experience in LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen, Masahiro Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T18:50:09Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) serving, the KV-cache (KVC) bottleneck causes high tail Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT), impairing user experience, particularly in time-sensitive applications. However, satisfying both TTFT and TBT service-level objectives (SLOs) is challenging. To address this, we propose a system, named CacheOPT for mitigating KV Cache competition, based on key insights from our measurements, incorporating novel components. First, it estimates a request's output length, bounding the deviation with a high specified probability, adjusted based on the request arrival rate. Second, it allocates the estimated KVC demand to a request, and reuses other requests' allocated KVC to avoid preemptions while reducing waiting time. Third, it proactively allocates KVC before instead of at the time a request exhausts its allocation and reserves KVC globally to prevent preemptions. Fourth, it chooses a request that has long TBT SLO, long job remaining time and short preemption time to preempt. Fifth, it selects the shortest-latency strategy between swapping and recomputation for preemptions. Experiments show that CacheOPT achieves up to 3.29$\times$ and 2.83$\times$ lower tail TBT and tail TTFT, 47\% and 53\% higher TTFT and TBT SLO attainments, and supports up to 1.58$\times$ higher request arrival rate than the state-of-the-art methods.

### EconoServe: Maximizing Multi-Resource Utilization with SLO Guarantees in   LLM Serving
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T18:16:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EconoServe. EconoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EconoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EconoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

### xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression
**Authors**: Chi-Chih Chang, Chien-Yu Lin, Yash Akhauri, Wei-Cheng Lin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Luis Ceze, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T17:06:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV.

### HERMES: High-Performance RISC-V Memory Hierarchy for ML Workloads
**Authors**: Pranav Suryadevara

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:47:48Z

**Summary**: The growth of machine learning (ML) workloads has underscored the importance of efficient memory hierarchies to address bandwidth, latency, and scalability challenges. HERMES focuses on optimizing memory subsystems for RISC-V architectures to meet the computational needs of ML models such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. This project explores state-of-the-art techniques such as advanced prefetching, tensor-aware caching, and hybrid memory models. The cornerstone of HERMES is the integration of shared L3 caches with fine-grained coherence protocols equipped with specialized pathways to deep-learning accelerators such as Gemmini. Simulation tools like Gem5 and DRAMSim2 were used to evaluate baseline performance and scalability under representative ML workloads. The findings of this study highlight the design choices, and the anticipated challenges, paving the way for low-latency scalable memory operations for ML applications.

### Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory   Controller Design
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:44:32Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

### Exploring the Integration of Key-Value Attention Into Pure and Hybrid   Transformers for Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: DeShin Hwa, Tobias Holmes, Klaus Drechsler

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:38:31Z

**Summary**: While CNNs were long considered state of the art for image processing, the introduction of Transformer architectures has challenged this position. While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.

### BitDecoding: Unlocking Tensor Cores for Long-Context LLMs Decoding with   Low-Bit KV Cache
**Authors**: Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Ting Cao, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T15:22:41Z

**Summary**: The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs. However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/DD-DuDa/BitDecoding.

### Choosing Augmentation Parameters in OSQP- A New Approach based on   Conjugate Directions
**Authors**: Avinash Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T13:09:03Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a new method to select the augmentation parameters in the operator splitting quadratic program (OSQP) algorithm so as to reduce the computation time of overall algorithm. The selection is based upon the information of conjugate directions of the coefficient matrix of a linear system of equations present in the algorithm. This selection makes it possible to cache these conjugate directions, instead of computing them at each iteration, resulting in faster computation of the solution of the linear system thus reducing the overall computation time. This reduction is demonstrated by a numerical example.

### Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV   Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Minsu Kim, Seongmin Hong, RyeoWook Ko, Soongyu Choi, Hunjong Lee, Junsoo Kim, Joo-Young Kim, Jongse Park

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T11:56:50Z

**Summary**: Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to achieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging, rendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.

### Register Dispersion: Reducing the Footprint of the Vector Register File   in Vector Engines of Low-Cost RISC-V CPUs
**Authors**: Vasileios Titopoulos, George Alexakis, Kosmas Alexandridis, Chrysostomos Nicopoulos, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T11:00:35Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Machine Learning (ML) applications at the edge on resource-constrained devices has accentuated the need for efficient ML processing on low-cost processors. While traditional CPUs provide programming flexibility, their general-purpose architecture often lacks the throughput required for complex ML models. The augmentation of a RISC-V processor with a vector unit can provide substantial data-level parallelism. However, increasing the data-level parallelism supported by vector processing would make the Vector Register File (VRF) a major area consumer in ultra low-cost processors, since 32 vector registers are required for RISC-V Vector ISA compliance. This work leverages the insight that many ML vectorized kernels require a small number of active vector registers, and proposes the use of a physically smaller VRF that dynamically caches only the vector registers currently accessed by the application. This approach, called Register Dispersion, maps the architectural vector registers to a smaller set of physical registers. The proposed ISA-compliant VRF is significantly smaller than a full-size VRF and operates like a conventional cache, i.e., it only stores the most recently accessed vector registers. Essential registers remain readily accessible within the compact VRF, while the others are offloaded to the cache/memory sub-system. The compact VRF design is demonstrated to yield substantial area and power savings, as compared to using a full VRF, with no or minimal impact on performance. This effective trade-off renders the inclusion of vector units in low-cost processors feasible and practical.

### Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit and Real-Time: An Empirical Evaluation
**Authors**: Ashutosh Pradhan, Daniele Ottaviano, Yi Jiang, Haozheng Huang, Alexander Zuepke, Andrea Bastoni, Marco Caccamo

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T07:29:28Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of embedded hardware platforms poses significant challenges for real-time workloads. Architectural features such as Intel RDT, Arm QoS, and Arm MPAM are either unavailable on commercial embedded platforms or designed primarily for server environments optimized for average-case performance and might fail to deliver the expected real-time guarantees. Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) includes isolation features-among others, hardware per-way cache partitioning-that can improve the real-time guarantees of complex embedded multicore systems and facilitate real-time analysis. However, the DSU also targets average cases, and its real-time capabilities have not yet been evaluated. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of three real-world deployments of the Arm DSU on Rockchip RK3568, Rockchip RK3588, and NVIDIA Orin platforms. We integrate support for the DSU at the operating system and hypervisor level and conduct a large-scale evaluation using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with varying types and intensities of interference. Our results make extensive use of performance counters and indicate that, although effective, the quality of partitioning and isolation provided by the DSU depends on the type and the intensity of the interfering workloads. In addition, we uncover and analyze in detail the correlation between benchmarks and different types and intensities of interference.

### Mitigating Cache Noise in Test-Time Adaptation for Large Vision-Language   Models
**Authors**: Haotian Zhai, Xinyu Chen, Can Zhang, Tianming Sha, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T04:32:35Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted significant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA methods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached feature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these features to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval methods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme samples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class distributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of cached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive and reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called ``Cache, Residual, Gaussian" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable residual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes with text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but also incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model intra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy features. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and adaptability.

### iFlame: Interleaving Full and Linear Attention for Efficient Mesh   Generation
**Authors**: Hanxiao Wang, Biao Zhang, Weize Quan, Dong-Ming Yan, Peter Wonka

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T03:18:49Z

**Summary**: This paper propose iFlame, a novel transformer-based network architecture for mesh generation. While attention-based models have demonstrated remarkable performance in mesh generation, their quadratic computational complexity limits scalability, particularly for high-resolution 3D data. Conversely, linear attention mechanisms offer lower computational costs but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this trade-off, we propose an interleaving autoregressive mesh generation framework that combines the efficiency of linear attention with the expressive power of full attention mechanisms. To further enhance efficiency and leverage the inherent structure of mesh representations, we integrate this interleaving approach into an hourglass architecture, which significantly boosts efficiency. Our approach reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to pure attention-based models. To improve inference efficiency, we implemented a caching algorithm that almost doubles the speed and reduces the KV cache size by seven-eighths compared to the original Transformer. We evaluate our framework on ShapeNet and Objaverse, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality 3D meshes efficiently. Our results indicate that the proposed interleaving framework effectively balances computational efficiency and generative performance, making it a practical solution for mesh generation. The training takes only 2 days with 4 GPUs on 39k data with a maximum of 4k faces on Objaverse.

**Authors**: Chen Zhang, Kuntai Du, Shu Liu, Woosuk Kwon, Xiangxi Mo, Yufeng Wang, Xiaoxuan Liu, Kaichao You, Zhuohan Li, Mingsheng Long, Jidong Zhai, Joseph Gonzalez, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T02:28:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but expensive to run, especially as inference workloads grow. To lower costs, maximizing the request batch size by managing GPU memory efficiently is crucial. While PagedAttention has recently been proposed to improve the efficiency of memory management, we find that the growing heterogeneity in the embeddings dimensions, attention, and access patterns of modern LLM architectures introduces new challenges for memory allocation.   In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1) minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes, and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching logic to enhance memory reuse.   We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations. Evaluations show that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases serving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average).

### ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T02:17:34Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%. Our code is available at https://github.com/SCZwangxiao/video-ReTaKe.

### TopV: Compatible Token Pruning with Inference Time Optimization for Fast   and Low-Memory Multimodal Vision Language Model
**Authors**: Cheng Yang, Yang Sui, Jinqi Xiao, Lingyi Huang, Yu Gong, Chendi Li, Jinghua Yan, Yu Bai, Ponnuswamy Sadayappan, Xia Hu, Bo Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T01:47:26Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demand substantial computational resources during inference, largely due to the extensive visual input tokens for representing visual information. Previous studies have noted that visual tokens tend to receive less attention than text tokens, suggesting their lower importance during inference and potential for pruning. However, their methods encounter several challenges: reliance on greedy heuristic criteria for token importance and incompatibility with FlashAttention and KV cache. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{TopV}, a compatible \textbf{TO}ken \textbf{P}runing with inference Time Optimization for fast and low-memory \textbf{V}LM, achieving efficient pruning without additional training or fine-tuning. Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning as an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens while remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only perform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces KV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost function considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial Distance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each source visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token pruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T01:15:43Z

**Summary**: Effective risk management solutions become absolutely crucial when financial markets embrace distributed technology and decentralized financing (DeFi). This study offers a thorough survey and comparative analysis of the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in risk management for distributed arbitrage systems. We examine several modern caching techniques namely in memory caching, distributed caching, and proxy caching and their functions in enhancing performance in decentralized settings. Through literature review we examine the utilization of AI techniques for alleviating risks related to market volatility, liquidity challenges, operational failures, regulatory compliance, and security threats. This comparison research evaluates various case studies from prominent DeFi technologies, emphasizing critical performance metrics like latency reduction, load balancing, and system resilience. Additionally, we examine the problems and trade offs associated with these technologies, emphasizing their effects on consistency, scalability, and fault tolerance. By meticulously analyzing real world applications, specifically centering on the Aave platform as our principal case study, we illustrate how the purposeful amalgamation of AI with contemporary caching methodologies has revolutionized risk management in distributed arbitrage systems.

### Enabling the Write-Back Page Cache with Strong Consistency in   Distributed Userspace File Systems
**Authors**: Haoyu Li, Jingkai Fu, Qing Li, Windsor Hsu, Asaf Cidon

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T20:18:16Z

**Summary**: The large-scale, multi-tenant nature of cloud computing requires distributed file systems that offer stability, adaptability, and compatibility. FUSE-based distributed file systems have emerged as a popular solution for the cloud, offering fast deployment, fault isolation, and POSIX compliance. However, FUSE's performance limitations, particularly its inability to reconcile page caching with strong consistency in distributed environments, remain a persistent problem. Existing approaches either sacrifice consistency for performance or rely on inefficient caching, limiting their practicality.   To this end, we present DistFUSE, the first FUSE-based distributed file system that relies on a write-back kernel-based page cache for performance and provides strong consistency. DistFUSE achieves this by offloading userspace lock management to the kernel driver, allowing coordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design eliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide consistency without compromising performance. Our evaluation shows DistFUSE improves throughput by up to 75% compared to baseline approaches.

### Formal Verification of Parameterized Systems based on Induction
**Authors**: Jiaqi Xiu, Yongjian Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T11:07:24Z

**Summary**: Parameterized systems play a crucial role in the computer field, and their security is of great significance. Formal verification of parameterized protocols is especially challenging due to its "parameterized" feature, which brings complexity and undecidability. Existing automated parameterized verification methods have limitations, such as facing difficulties in automatically deriving parameterized invariants constrained by mixed Forall and Exists quantifiers, or having challenges in completing the parameterized verification of large and complex protocols. This paper proposes a formal verification framework for parameterized systems based on induction, named wiseParaverifier. It starts from small concretizations of protocols, analyzes inductive counterexamples, and constructs counterexample formulas to guide the entire process of parameterized verification. It also presents a heuristic Generalize method to quickly find auxiliary invariants, a method for promoting complex mixed quantifiers and merging parameterized invariants, and uses symmetric reduction ideas to accelerate the verification process. Experimental results show that wiseParaverifier can successfully complete automatic inductive verification on 7 cache coherence protocols and 10 distributed protocols. It has strong verification capabilities and migration capabilities, and can provide concise and readable verification results, which is helpful for learners to understand protocol behaviors.

### Knowledge Rumination for Client Utility Evaluation in Heterogeneous   Federated Learning
**Authors**: Xiaorui Jiang, Yu Gao, Hengwei Xu, Qi Zhang, Yong Liao, Pengyuan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T06:14:35Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) allows several clients to cooperatively train machine learning models without disclosing the raw data. In practical applications, asynchronous FL (AFL) can address the straggler effect compared to synchronous FL. However, Non-IID data and stale models pose significant challenges to AFL, as they can diminish the practicality of the global model and even lead to training failures. In this work, we propose a novel AFL framework called Federated Historical Learning (FedHist), which effectively addresses the challenges posed by both Non-IID data and gradient staleness based on the concept of knowledge rumination. FedHist enhances the stability of local gradients by performing weighted fusion with historical global gradients cached on the server. Relying on hindsight, it assigns aggregation weights to each participant in a multi-dimensional manner during each communication round. To further enhance the efficiency and stability of the training process, we introduce an intelligent $\ell_2$-norm amplification scheme, which dynamically regulates the learning progress based on the $\ell_2$-norms of the submitted gradients. Extensive experiments indicate FedHist outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence performance and test accuracy.

### WindowKV: Task-Adaptive Group-Wise KV Cache Window Selection for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Youhui Zuo, Sibo Wei, Chen Zhang, Zhuorui Liu, Wenpeng Lu, Dawei Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T03:36:52Z

**Summary**: With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational components. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

### Cache-Aware Cooperative Multicast Beamforming in Dynamic   Satellite-Terrestrial Networks
**Authors**: Shuo Yuan, Yaohua Sun, Mugen Peng

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T03:20:25Z

**Summary**: With the burgeoning demand for data-intensive services, satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) face increasing backhaul link congestion, deteriorating user quality of service (QoS), and escalating power consumption. Cache-aided STNs are acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to users and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among satellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively managing limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming to reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate a mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite beam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and base stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage solution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term content delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The former subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach with whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according to the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an iterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their convergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic by up to 52%.

**Authors**: Xiaoyao Zhong, Haotian Li, Jiabao Jin, Mingyu Yang, Deming Chu, Xiangyu Wang, Zhitao Shen, Wei Jia, George Gu, Yi Xie, Xuemin Lin, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song, Peng Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T03:16:50Z

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index.   This paper introduces VSAG, an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory access: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii) efficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.

### Orientation-Dependent \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode with Atomic   Layer Deposition (ALD) Grown NiO
**Authors**: Yizheng Liu, Shane M. W. Witsell, John F. Conley, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T01:17:08Z

**Summary**: This work reports the demonstration of ALD-deposited NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) on low doped drift layer and highly doped (001) & (100) n+ substrates with experimental observation of a parallel-plane junction electric field as high as 7.5 MV/cm, revealing a crystal orientation dependence in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We use a novel metalorganic precursor bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl) (nickel Ni(tBu2DAD)2) with ozone (O3) to deposit NiO. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD on 7.7 {\mu}m-thick HVPE-grown drift region exhibited an on-state current density of ~20 A/cm2 at 5 V, ~10-8 A/cm2 reverse leakage at low reverse bias(-5 V), and a rectifying ratio(Jon/Joff) of ~109. The HJD broke down at ~2.2 kV reverse bias, corresponding to a ~3.4 MV/cm parallel-plane junction electric field, with a noise floor reverse leakage (10-8~10-6 A/cm2, nA) at 80% of the device catastrophic breakdown voltage. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs on n+ (001) & (100) highly-doped substrates exhibited breakdown voltages at 12.5-16.0 V and 28.5-70.5 V, respectively, with extracted critical electric field (EC) at 2.30-2.76 MV/cm, and 4.33-7.50 MV/cm, revealing a substrate crystal orientation dependence on breakdown electric field for \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The 7.5 MV/cm EC reported here is one of the highest parallel-plane junction electric fields reported in literature.

### A Generative Caching System for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Arun Iyengar, Ashish Kundu, Ramana Kompella, Sai Nandan Mamidi

**Updated**: 2025-03-22T01:17:56Z

**Summary**: Caching has the potential to be of significant benefit for accessing large language models (LLMs) due to their high latencies which typically range from a small number of seconds to well over a minute. Furthermore, many LLMs charge money for queries; caching thus has a clear monetary benefit. This paper presents a new caching system for improving user experiences with LLMs. In addition to reducing both latencies and monetary costs for accessing LLMs, our system also provides important features that go beyond the performance benefits typically associated with caches. A key feature we provide is generative caching, wherein multiple cached responses can be synthesized to provide answers to queries which have never been seen before. Our generative caches function as repositories of valuable information which can be mined and analyzed. We also improve upon past semantic caching techniques by tailoring the caching algorithms to optimally balance cost and latency reduction with the quality of responses provided. Performance tests indicate that our caches are considerably faster than GPTcache.

### Multiport Support for Vortex OpenGPU Memory Hierarchy
**Authors**: Injae Shin, Blaise Tine

**Updated**: 2025-03-22T01:16:24Z

**Summary**: Modern day applications have grown in size and require more computational power. The rise of machine learning and AI increased the need for parallel computation, which has increased the need for GPGPUs. With the increasing demand for computational power, GPGPUs' SIMT architecture has solved this with an increase in the number of threads and the number of cores in a GPU, increasing the throughput of these processors to match the demand of the applications. However, this created a larger demand for the memory, making the memory bandwidth a bottleneck. The introduction of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with its increased number of memory ports offers a potential solution for the GPU to exploit its memory parallelism to increase the memory bandwidth. However, effectively leveraging HBM's memory parallelism to maximize bandwidth presents a unique and complex challenge for GPU architectures on how to distribute those ports among the streaming multiprocessors in the GPGPU. In this work, we extend the Vortex OpenGPU microarchitecture to incorporate a multiport memory hierarchy, spanning from the L1 cache to the last-level cache (LLC). In addition, we propose various arbitration strategies to optimize memory transfers across the cache hierarchy. The results have shown that an increase in memory ports increases IPC, achieving an average speedup of 2.34x with 8 memory ports in the tested configuration while showing relatively small area overhead.

### PIM Is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for Large Language   Model Inference
**Authors**: Yufeng Gu, Alireza Khadem, Sumanth Umesh, Ning Liang, Xavier Servot, Onur Mutlu, Ravi Iyer, Reetuparna Das

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T21:10:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.

### RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Quan Wei, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi-To Wai, Yang Katie Zhao, Dongyeop Kang, Youngsuk Park, Mingyi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T19:26:12Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.

### LazyDiT: Lazy Learning for the Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Xuan Shen, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou, Bo Chen, Yanyu Li, Yifan Gong, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Jason Kuen, Henghui Ding, Zhihao Shu, Wei Niu, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang, Jiuxiang Gu

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T15:52:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/lazydit

### AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out   Context Attribution
**Authors**: Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Colin Raffel

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T15:47:53Z

**Summary**: The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaosheng Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Yao Hu, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T13:30:33Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

### Language-Queried Target Sound Extraction Without Parallel Training Data
**Authors**: Hao Ma, Zhiyuan Peng, Xu Li, Yukai Li, Mingjie Shao, Qiuqiang Kong, Ju Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T12:51:15Z

**Summary**: Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

**Authors**: Anshumann, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Akhil Kedia, Jinwoo Ahn, Taehwak Kwon, Kangwook Lee, Haejun Lee, Joohyung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T05:58:18Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

**Authors**: Feiyang Li, Yingjian Chen, Haoran Liu, Rui Yang, Han Yuan, Yuang Jiang, Tianxiao Li, Edison Marrese Taylor, Hossein Rouhizadeh, Yusuke Iwasawa, Douglas Teodoro, Yutaka Matsuo, Irene Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T01:59:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical question answering (QA), yet their effectiveness remains predominantly limited to English due to imbalanced multilingual training data and scarce medical resources for low-resource languages. To address this critical language gap in medical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking (MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric LLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation mechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric medical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating cross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across language barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle ranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing response times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive evaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms zero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 35.03% increase in accuracy, while maintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.

### A Scalable Crawling Algorithm Utilizing Noisy Change-Indicating Signals
**Authors**: Róbert Busa-Fekete, Julian Zimmert, András György, Linhai Qiu, Tzu-Wei Sung, Hao Shen, Hyomin Choi, Sharmila Subramaniam, Li Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T21:49:15Z

**Summary**: Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh, that is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given a limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the change and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson processes, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In this paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information indicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example, signals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available. Incorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging, because (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with missing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance over web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might differ from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm which (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild assumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii) is able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total bandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new optimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized computation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T17:37:15Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block-wise competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### Unleashing Vecset Diffusion Model for Fast Shape Generation
**Authors**: Zeqiang Lai, Yunfei Zhao, Zibo Zhao, Haolin Liu, Fuyun Wang, Huiwen Shi, Xianghui Yang, Qinxiang Lin, Jinwei Huang, Yuhong Liu, Jie Jiang, Chunchao Guo, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T16:23:44Z

**Summary**: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Tencent/FlashVDM.

### Plug-and-Play 1.x-Bit KV Cache Quantization for Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Can Qin, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T15:52:43Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated the capability to process longer video inputs and enable complex reasoning and analysis. However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.

### SpeCache: Speculative Key-Value Caching for Efficient Generation of LLMs
**Authors**: Shibo Jie, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jing Han

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T14:01:56Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have already achieved remarkable results on long-text tasks, but the limited GPU memory (VRAM) resources struggle to accommodate the linearly growing demand for key-value (KV) cache as the sequence length increases, which has become a bottleneck for the application of LLMs on long sequences. Existing KV cache compression methods include eviction, merging, or quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size. However, compression results in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding. In this paper, we propose SpeCache, which takes full advantage of the large and easily expandable CPU memory to offload the complete KV cache, and dynamically fetches KV pairs back in each decoding step based on their importance measured by low-bit KV cache copy in VRAM. To avoid inference latency caused by CPU-GPU communication, SpeCache speculatively predicts the KV pairs that the next token might attend to, allowing us to prefetch them before the next decoding step which enables parallelization of prefetching and computation. Experiments on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks verify that SpeCache effectively reduces VRAM usage while avoiding information forgetting for long sequences without re-training, even with a 10x high KV cache compression ratio.

### PromptMobile: Efficient Promptus for Low Bandwidth Mobile Video   Streaming
**Authors**: Liming Liu, Jiangkai Wu, Haoyang Wang, Peiheng Wang, Xinggong Zhang, Zongming Guo

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T13:00:36Z

**Summary**: Traditional video compression algorithms exhibit significant quality degradation at extremely low bitrates. Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed. Compared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS improvement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\% of severely distorted frames (compared to VQGAN).

### BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to   Accelerate Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Hui Zhang, Tingwei Gao, Jie Shao, Zuxuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T08:07:31Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.

### Mobile Edge Intelligence for Large Language Models: A Contemporary   Survey
**Authors**: Guanqiao Qu, Qiyuan Chen, Wei Wei, Zheng Lin, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T05:23:42Z

**Summary**: On-device large language models (LLMs), referring to running LLMs on edge devices, have raised considerable interest since they are more cost-effective, latency-efficient, and privacy-preserving compared with the cloud paradigm. Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.

### Formalising CXL Cache Coherence
**Authors**: Chengsong Tan, Alastair F. Donaldson, John Wickerson

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T10:19:30Z

**Summary**: We report our experience formally modelling and verifying CXL.cache, the inter-device cache coherence protocol of the Compute Express Link standard. We have used the Isabelle proof assistant to create a formal model for CXL.cache based on the prose English specification. This led to us identifying and proposing fixes to several problems we identified as unclear, ambiguous or inaccurate, some of which could lead to incoherence if left unfixed. Nearly all our issues and proposed fixes have been confirmed and tentatively accepted by the CXL consortium for adoption, save for one which is still under discussion. To validate the faithfulness of our model we performed scenario verification of essential restrictions such as "Snoop-pushes-GO", and produced a fully mechanised proof of a coherence property of the model. The considerable size of this proof, comprising tens of thousands of lemmas, prompted us to develop new proof automation tools, which we have made available for other Isabelle users working with similarly cumbersome proofs.

### Exploring the Limits of KV Cache Compression in Visual Autoregressive   Transformers
**Authors**: Bo Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yekun Ke, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T04:18:57Z

**Summary**: A fundamental challenge in Visual Autoregressive models is the substantial memory overhead required during inference to store previously generated representations. Despite various attempts to mitigate this issue through compression techniques, prior works have not explicitly formalized the problem of KV-cache compression in this context. In this work, we take the first step in formally defining the KV-cache compression problem for Visual Autoregressive transformers. We then establish a fundamental negative result, proving that any mechanism for sequential visual token generation under attention-based architectures must use at least $\Omega(n^2 d)$ memory, when $d = \Omega(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated and $d$ is the embedding dimensionality. This result demonstrates that achieving truly sub-quadratic memory usage is impossible without additional structural constraints. Our proof is constructed via a reduction from a computational lower bound problem, leveraging randomized embedding techniques inspired by dimensionality reduction principles. Finally, we discuss how sparsity priors on visual representations can influence memory efficiency, presenting both impossibility results and potential directions for mitigating memory overhead.

### Degradation of 2.4-kV $Ga_{2}O_{3}$ Schottky Barrier Diode at High   Temperatures up to 500 °C
**Authors**: Hunter Ellis, Wei Jia, Imteaz Rahaman, Apostoli Hillas, Botong Li, Michael A. Scarpulla, Berardi Sensale Rodriguez, Kai Fu

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T00:30:43Z

**Summary**: Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes featuring a field plate and a composite SiO2/SiNx dielectric layer beneath the field plate were fabricated, achieving a breakdown voltage of 2.4 kV at room temperature. Electrical performance and degradation were analyzed via I-V and C-V measurements from 25 {\deg}C to 500 {\deg}C, revealing temperature-dependent transport, interface stability, and device stability. Upon returning to room temperature, the diodes exhibited nearly unchanged forward characteristics, while the breakdown voltage declined significantly from 2.4 kV to 700 V. This behavior indicates a temperature-induced reduction in the barrier height. Detailed analysis revealed that variable range hopping (VRH) dominated the leakage mechanism at moderate temperatures, while thermal emission (TE) became increasingly significant at temperatures exceeding 400 {\deg}C.

### Towards More Economical Context-Augmented LLM Generation by Reusing   Stored KV Cache
**Authors**: Hanchen Li, Yuhan Liu, Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T18:52:03Z

**Summary**: Across large language model (LLM) applications, we observe an emerging trend for reusing KV caches to save the prefill delays of processing repeated input texts in different LLM inputs. This has led to a broad design space, including colocating stored KV caches with (or close to) GPUs to various KV cache compression. However, a key question remains unanswered: can these delay reductions also be economically favorable? Specifically, we ask whether a developer can use public cloud services to store precomputed KV caches and reuse them to save delay without incurring more costs in terms of compute, storage, and network. To answer this question, we propose an validated analytical model for the cloud cost (in compute, storage, and network) of storing and reusing KV caches based on various workload parameters, such as reuse frequency, generated text lengths, model sizes, etc. Preliminary results show that KV cache reusing is able to save both delay and cloud cost across a range of workloads with long context. And we call more efforts on building more economical context augmented LLM by KV cache reusing.

### Efficient Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Dynamic Block-Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Emily Xiao, Chin-Jou Li, Yilin Zhang, Graham Neubig, Amanda Bertsch

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T17:13:42Z

**Summary**: Many-shot in-context learning has recently shown promise as an alternative to finetuning, with the major advantage that the same model can be served for multiple tasks. However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale.

### Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion   Language Models
**Authors**: Marianne Arriola, Aaron Gokaslan, Justin T Chiu, Zhihan Yang, Zhixuan Qi, Jiaqi Han, Subham Sekhar Sahoo, Volodymyr Kuleshov

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T15:58:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on the project page: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/

### Suffixient Arrays: a New Efficient Suffix Array Compression Technique
**Authors**: Davide Cenzato, Lore Depuydt, Travis Gagie, Sung-Hwan Kim, Giovanni Manzini, Francisco Olivares, Nicola Prezza

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T09:43:33Z

**Summary**: The Suffix Array is a classic text index enabling on-line pattern matching queries via simple binary search. The main drawback of the Suffix Array is that it takes linear space in the text's length, even if the text itself is extremely compressible. Several works in the literature showed that the Suffix Array can be compressed, but they all rely on complex succinct data structures which in practice tend to exhibit poor cache locality and thus significantly slow down queries. In this paper, we propose a new simple and very efficient solution to this problem by presenting the \emph{Suffixient Array}: a tiny subset of the Suffix Array \emph{sufficient} to locate on-line one pattern occurrence (in general, all its Maximal Exact Matches) via binary search, provided that random access to the text is available. We prove that: (i) the Suffixient Array length $\chi$ is a strong repetitiveness measure, (ii) unlike most existing repetition-aware indexes such as the $r$-index, our new index is efficient in the I/O model, and (iii) Suffixient Arrays can be computed in linear time and compressed working space. We show experimentally that, when using well-established compressed random access data structures on repetitive collections, the Suffixient Array $\SuA$ is \emph{simultaneously} (i) faster and orders of magnitude smaller than the Suffix Array $\SA$ and (ii) smaller and \emph{one to two orders of magnitude faster} than the $r$-index. With an average pattern matching query time as low as 3.5 ns per character, our new index gets very close to the ultimate lower bound: the RAM throughput of our workstation (1.18 ns per character).

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face deployment challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity, growing Key-Value cache requirements, and reliance on separate vision encoders. We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T04:49:23Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### Efficient Hardware Accelerator Based on Medium Granularity Dataflow for   SpTRSV
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Xiaofeng Yang, Shengli Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-18T01:58:36Z

**Summary**: Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous studies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware accelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine granularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low parallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the spatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This paper proposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like DAGs. The accelerator implements a medium granularity dataflow through hardware-software codesign and achieves both excellent spatial locality and high parallelism. Additionally, a partial sum caching mechanism is introduced to reduce the blocking frequency of processing elements (PEs), and a reordering algorithm of intra-node edges computation is developed to enhance data reuse. Experimental results on 245 benchmarks with node counts reaching up to 85,392 demonstrate that this work achieves average performance improvements of 7.0$\times$ (up to 27.8$\times$) over CPUs and 5.8$\times$ (up to 98.8$\times$) over GPUs. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique (DPU-v2), this work shows a 2.5$\times$ (up to 5.9$\times$) average performance improvement and 1.7$\times$ (up to 4.1$\times$) average energy efficiency enhancement.

### AccelGen: Heterogeneous SLO-Guaranteed High-Throughput LLM Inference   Serving for Diverse Applications
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T21:47:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we consider a mixed-prompt scenario for a large language model (LLM) inference serving system that supports diverse applications with both short prompts and long prompts and heterogeneous SLOs for iteration time. To improve throughput when handling long prompts, previous research introduces a chunking method, but has not addressed heterogeneous SLOs. To address the limitation, we propose AccelGen, a high-throughput LLM inference serving system with heterogeneous SLO guarantees for diverse applications. AccelGen introduces four core components: (1) SLO-guaranteed dynamic chunking, which dynamically adjusts chunk sizes to maximize GPU compute utilization while meeting iteration-level SLOs; (2) Iteration-level SLO-based task prioritization, which prioritizes tight-SLO requests and batches requests with similar SLOs; (3) Multi-resource-aware batching, which selects queued requests to maximize the utilizations of both GPU compute resource and key-value cache (KVC). Trace-driven real experiments demonstrate that AccelGen achieves 1.42-11.21X higher throughput, 1.43-13.71X higher goodput, 37-90% higher SLO attainment, and 1.61-12.22X lower response latency compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. It achieves performance near the Oracle, which optimally maximizes goodput.

### Fast Maximum Likelihood Positioning for a Staggered Layer Scintillation   PET Detector
**Authors**: Christoph W. Lerche, Wenwei Bi, Mirjam Schoeneck, Debora Niekaemper, Qi Liu, Elisabeth Pfaehler, Lutz Tellmann, Juergen J. Scheins, N. Jon Shah

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T21:11:30Z

**Summary**: In this study, we propose a fast implementation of a Maximum Likelihood Positioning (MLP) algorithm to estimate the energy and identify the active scintillator pixel in staggered layer scintillation detectors for PET. The staggered layer design with pixelated scintillators enables the determination of the gamma's depth of interaction and facilitates an iteration-free formulation of the MLP algorithm. The efficacy of the algorithm optimization was tested on a scintillation detector block designed for an ultra-high field BrainPET 7T, comprising three scintillator pixel layers. The three layers contain 24 x 24, 24 x 23 and 23 x 22 scintillator pixels, respectively, with a pixel pitch of 2 mm in both directions and layer thicknesses of 9, 8 and 7 mm. Calibration measurements, in combination with an automated calibration script, were used to obtain the expected counts of scintillation photons required in the MLP algorithm. Using Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization, multi-threading and optimized cache lines, a maximum processing speed of approximately 22.5 million singles per second was achieved on a platform with four Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs and 60 threads, encompassing all required processing steps. The automatic calibration failed for 1 to 15 individual scintillator pixels in approximately 10 per cent of the 120 scintillation detector blocks, necessitating manual correction. After applying the energy correction to the positioned single events, an energy resolution of of 12 +/- 2 per cent FWHM was obtained for the entire scintillation block. This value is very close to the energy resolutions measured for the individual scintillator pixels, proving that the MLP accurately identifies the scintillating pixel and that the energy correction method effectively compensates for the light collection variations of the SiPM array.

**Authors**: Hui Wang, Zhengpeng Zhao, Jing Wang, Yushu Du, Yuan Cheng, Bing Guo, He Xiao, Chenhao Ma, Xiaomeng Han, Dean You, Jiapeng Guan, Ran Wei, Dawei Yang, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T20:31:46Z

**Summary**: Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount.

**Authors**: Risheng Xu, Philipp Sieweck, Hermann von Hasseln, Dirk Nowotka

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T19:32:26Z

**Summary**: We introduce preti, a novel framework for predicting software execution time during the early stages of development. preti leverages an LLVM-based simulation environment to extract timing-related runtime information, such as the count of executed LLVM IR instructions. This information, combined with historical execution time data, is utilized to train machine learning models for accurate time prediction. To further enhance prediction accuracy, our approach incorporates simulations of cache accesses and branch prediction. The evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that preti achieves an average Absolute Percentage Error (APE) of 11.98\%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of preti as a robust solution for early-stage timing analysis.

### KVShare: Semantic-Aware Key-Value Cache Sharing for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Huan Yang, Renji Zhang, Deyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T16:43:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents KVShare, a multi-user Key-Value (KV) Cache sharing technology based on semantic similarity, designed to enhance the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Addressing the limitations of existing prefix caching (strict text prefix matching) and semantic caching (loss of response diversity), KVShare achieves fine-grained KV cache reuse through semantic alignment algorithms and differential editing operations. Experiments on real-world user conversation datasets demonstrate that KVShare improves KV cache hit rates by over 60%, while maintaining output quality comparable to full computation (no significant degradation in BLEU and Rouge-L metrics). This approach effectively reduces GPU resource consumption and is applicable to scenarios with repetitive queries, such as healthcare and education.

### Knowledge-Aware Iterative Retrieval for Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Seyoung Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T15:27:02Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T09:46:35Z

**Summary**: As a part of the IRIS-HEP "Analysis Grand Challenge" activities, the Coffea-casa AF team executed a "200 Gbps Challenge". One of the goals of this challenge was to provide a setup for execution of a test notebook-style analysis on the facility that could process a 200 TB CMS NanoAOD dataset in 20 minutes.   We describe the solutions we deployed at the facility to execute the challenge tasks. The facility was configured to provide 2000+ cores for quick turn-around, low-latency analysis. To reach the highest event processing rates we tested different scaling backends, both scaling over HTCondor and Kubernetes resources and using Dask and Taskvine schedulers. This configuration also allowed us to compare two different services for managing Dask clusters, Dask labextention, and Dask Gateway server, under extreme conditions.   A robust set of XCache servers with a redirector were deployed in Kubernetes to cache the dataset to minimize wide-area network traffic. The XCache servers were backed with solid-state NVME drives deployed within the Kubernetes cluster nodes. All data access was authenticated using scitokens and was transparent to the user. To ensure we could track and measure data throughput precisely, we used our existing Prometheus monitoring stack to monitor the XCache pod throughput on the Kubernetes network layer. Using the rate query across all of the 8 XCache pods we were able to view a stacked cumulative graph of the total throughput for each XCache. This monitoring setup allowed us to ensure uniform data rates across all nodes while verifying we had reached the 200 Gbps benchmark.

### ROMA: a Read-Only-Memory-based Accelerator for QLoRA-based On-Device LLM
**Authors**: Wenqiang Wang, Yijia Zhang, Zikai Zhang, Guanting Huo, Hao Liang, Shijie Cao, Ningyi Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T09:44:17Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, deploying them on edge devices has become increasingly crucial, offering advantages in privacy and real-time interaction. QLoRA has emerged as the standard approach for on-device LLMs, leveraging quantized models to reduce memory and computational costs while utilizing LoRA for task-specific adaptability. In this work, we propose ROMA, a QLoRA accelerator with a hybrid storage architecture that uses ROM for quantized base models and SRAM for LoRA weights and KV cache. Our insight is that the quantized base model is stable and converged, making it well-suited for ROM storage. Meanwhile, LoRA modules offer the flexibility to adapt to new data without requiring updates to the base model. To further reduce the area cost of ROM, we introduce a novel B-ROM design and integrate it with the compute unit to form a fused cell for efficient use of chip resources. ROMA can effectively store both a 4-bit 3B and a 2-bit 8B LLaMA model entirely on-chip, achieving a notable generation speed exceeding 20,000 tokens/s without requiring external memory.

### WildSeg3D: Segment Any 3D Objects in the Wild from 2D Images
**Authors**: Yansong Guo, Jie Hu, Yansong Qu, Liujuan Cao

**Updated**: 2025-03-17T03:30:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in interactive 3D segmentation from 2D images have demonstrated impressive performance. However, current models typically require extensive scene-specific training to accurately reconstruct and segment objects, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the segmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a feed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in the accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can lead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global multi-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images, using a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive segmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that utilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond rapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across arbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training. Specifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA models. Our code will be publicly available.

### CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-16T12:49:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/cakekv.

### LazyMAR: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Feature Caching
**Authors**: Feihong Yan, Qingyan Wei, Jiayi Tang, Jiajun Li, Yulin Wang, Xuming Hu, Huiqi Li, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-16T10:54:59Z

**Summary**: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models have emerged as a promising approach in image generation, expected to surpass traditional autoregressive models in computational efficiency by leveraging the capability of parallel decoding. However, their dependence on bidirectional self-attention inherently conflicts with conventional KV caching mechanisms, creating unexpected computational bottlenecks that undermine their expected efficiency. To address this problem, this paper studies the caching mechanism for MAR by leveraging two types of redundancy: Token Redundancy indicates that a large portion of tokens have very similar representations in the adjacent decoding steps, which allows us to first cache them in previous steps and then reuse them in the later steps. Condition Redundancy indicates that the difference between conditional and unconditional output in classifier-free guidance exhibits very similar values in adjacent steps. Based on these two redundancies, we propose LazyMAR, which introduces two caching mechanisms to handle them one by one. LazyMAR is training-free and plug-and-play for all MAR models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 2.83 times acceleration with almost no drop in generation quality. Our codes will be released in https://github.com/feihongyan1/LazyMAR.

### Point-Cache: Test-time Dynamic and Hierarchical Cache for Robust and   Generalizable Point Cloud Analysis
**Authors**: Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Ming Cheng, Yongcai Wang, Deying Li, Chenhui Gou, Jianfei Cai

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T14:13:23Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data-often inaccessible during online inference-and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop Point-Cache, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-Cache.

### MoDM: Efficient Serving for Image Generation via Mixture-of-Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Yuchen Xia, Divyam Sharma, Yichao Yuan, Souvik Kundu, Nishil Talati

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T02:48:27Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trade latency for quality: small models are fast but generate lower-quality images, while large models produce better images but are slow.   We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families.   This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.   We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.

### CCRSat: A Collaborative Computation Reuse Framework for Satellite Edge   Computing Networks
**Authors**: Ye Zhang, Zhishu Shen, Dawen Jiang, Xiangrui Liu, Qiushi Zheng, Jiong Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T01:35:53Z

**Summary**: In satellite computing applications, such as remote sensing, tasks often involve similar or identical input data, leading to the same processing results. Computation reuse is an emerging paradigm that leverages the execution results of previous tasks to enhance the utilization of computational resources. While this paradigm has been extensively studied in terrestrial networks with abundant computing and caching resources, such as named data networking (NDN), it is essential to develop a framework appropriate for resource-constrained satellite networks, which are expected to have longer task completion times. In this paper, we propose CCRSat, a collaborative computation reuse framework for satellite edge computing networks. CCRSat initially implements local computation reuse on an independent satellite, utilizing a satellite reuse state (SRS) to assess the efficiency of computation reuse. Additionally, an inter-satellite computation reuse algorithm is introduced, which utilizes the collaborative sharing of similarity in previously processed data among multiple satellites. The evaluation results tested on real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared to comparative scenarios, our proposed CCRSat can significantly reduce task completion time by up to 62.1% and computational resource consumption by up to 28.8%.

### Accelerating Sparse Tensor Decomposition Using Adaptive Linearized   Representation
**Authors**: Jan Laukemann, Ahmed E. Helal, S. Isaac Geronimo Anderson, Fabio Checconi, Yongseok Soh, Jesmin Jahan Tithi, Teresa Ranadive, Brian J Gravelle, Fabrizio Petrini, Jee Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-15T00:49:55Z

**Summary**: High-dimensional sparse data emerge in many critical application domains such as healthcare and cybersecurity. To extract meaningful insights from massive volumes of these multi-dimensional data, scientists employ unsupervised analysis tools based on tensor decomposition (TD) methods. However, real-world sparse tensors exhibit highly irregular shapes and data distributions, which pose significant challenges for making efficient use of modern parallel processors. This study breaks the prevailing assumption that compressing sparse tensors into coarse-grained structures or along a particular dimension/mode is more efficient than keeping them in a fine-grained, mode-agnostic form. Our novel sparse tensor representation, Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (ALTO), encodes tensors in a compact format that can be easily streamed from memory and is amenable to both caching and parallel execution. In contrast to existing compressed tensor formats, ALTO constructs one tensor copy that is agnostic to both the mode orientation and the irregular distribution of nonzero elements. To demonstrate the efficacy of ALTO, we propose a set of parallel TD algorithms that exploit the inherent data reuse of tensor computations to substantially reduce synchronization overhead, decrease memory footprint, and improve parallel performance. Additionally, we characterize the major execution bottlenecks of TD methods on the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors and introduce dynamic adaptation heuristics to automatically select the best algorithm based on the sparse tensor characteristics. Across a diverse set of real-world data sets, ALTO outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude speedup over the best mode-agnostic formats. Compared to the best mode-specific formats, ALTO achieves 5.1X geometric mean speedup at a fraction (25%) of their storage costs.

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T19:02:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

### Making Every Step Effective: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models   Through Hierarchical KV Equalization
**Authors**: Shuyang Hao, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Jun Liu, Muhao Chen, Zi Huang, Yujun Cai

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T17:57:42Z

**Summary**: In the realm of large vision-language models (LVLMs), adversarial jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to identify safety vulnerabilities of these models and their associated defense mechanisms. However, we identify a critical limitation: not every adversarial optimization step leads to a positive outcome, and indiscriminately accepting optimization results at each step may reduce the overall attack success rate. To address this challenge, we introduce HKVE (Hierarchical Key-Value Equalization), an innovative jailbreaking framework that selectively accepts gradient optimization results based on the distribution of attention scores across different layers, ensuring that every optimization step positively contributes to the attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate HKVE's significant effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 75.08% on MiniGPT4, 85.84% on LLaVA and 81.00% on Qwen-VL, substantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 20.43\%, 21.01\% and 26.43\% respectively. Furthermore, making every step effective not only leads to an increase in attack success rate but also allows for a reduction in the number of iterations, thereby lowering computational costs. Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful example data.

### Alchemist: Towards the Design of Efficient Online Continual Learning   System
**Authors**: Yuyang Huang, Yuhan Liu, Haryadi S. Gunawi, Beibin Li, Changho Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T16:57:12Z

**Summary**: Continual learning has become a promising solution to refine large language models incrementally by leveraging user feedback. In particular, online continual learning - iteratively training the model with small batches of user feedback - has demonstrated notable performance improvements. However, the existing practice of separating training and serving processes forces the online trainer to recompute the intermediate results already done during serving. Such redundant computations can account for 30%-42% of total training time.   In this paper, we propose Alchemist, to the best of our knowledge, the first online continual learning system that efficiently reuses serving activations to increase training throughput. Alchemist introduces two key techniques: (1) recording and storing activations and KV cache only during the prefill phase to minimize latency and memory overhead; and (2) smart activation offloading and hedging. Evaluations with inputs of varied token length sampled from ShareGPT dataset show that compared with a separate training cluster, Alchemist significantly increases training throughput by up to 1.72x, reduces up to 47% memory usage during training, and supports up to 2x more training tokens - all while maintaining negligible impact on serving latency.

### ARCAS: Adaptive Runtime System for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling
**Authors**: Alessandro Fogli, Bo Zhao, Peter Pietzuch, Jana Giceva

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T14:47:55Z

**Summary**: The growing disparity between CPU core counts and available memory bandwidth has intensified memory contention in servers. This particularly affects highly parallelizable applications, which must achieve efficient cache utilization to maintain performance as CPU core counts grow. Optimizing cache utilization, however, is complex for recent chiplet-based CPUs, whose partitioned L3 caches lead to varying latencies and bandwidths, even within a single NUMA domain. Classical NUMA optimizations and task scheduling approaches unfortunately fail to address the performance issues of chiplet-based CPUs.   We describe Adaptive Runtime system for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling (ARCAS), a new runtime system designed for chiplet-based CPUs. ARCAS combines chiplet-aware task scheduling heuristics, hardware-aware memory allocation, and fine-grained performance monitoring to optimize workload execution. It implements a lightweight concurrency model that combines user-level thread features-such as individual stacks, per-task scheduling, and state management-with coroutine-like behavior, allowing tasks to suspend and resume execution at defined points while efficiently managing task migration across chiplets. Our evaluation across diverse scenarios shows ARCAS's effectiveness for optimizing the performance of memory-intensive parallel applications.

### Text Compression for Efficient Language Generation
**Authors**: David Gu, Peter Belcak, Roger Wattenhofer

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T14:14:05Z

**Summary**: We challenge the prevailing assumption that LLMs must rely fully on sub-word tokens for high-quality text generation. To this end, we propose the "Generative Pretrained Thoughtformer" (GPTHF), a hierarchical transformer language model capable of text generation by compressing text into sentence embeddings and employing a sentence attention mechanism. GPTHF retains GPT's architecture, modifying only token interactions via dynamic sparse attention masks.   Our experiments show that GPTHF achieves an up to an order of magnitude improvement in FLOPs efficiency and a threefold increase in runtime speed compared to equally-sized GPT models in the low-size regime. This is achieved through a unique generation method that caches and reuses sentence embeddings, allowing significant portions of the input to bypass large parts of the network.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T06:49:37Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid (i.e., combination of regular attention and MLA layers) or full MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. Our results show that using an 8B teacher model allows us to compress the KV cache size of the Llama3.2-1B-Inst baseline by 6.4x while preserving 100% of its average score across multiple tasks on the LM Harness Evaluation benchmark. This is achieved with only 3.6B training tokens and about 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300 GPUs, compared to the 370K GPU hours required for pre-training the Llama3.2-1B model.

### Limits of KV Cache Compression for Tensor Attention based Autoregressive   Transformers
**Authors**: Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian

**Updated**: 2025-03-14T06:01:42Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache in autoregressive transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference, which restricts the context length capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanism [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a novel reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. In the low dimensional regime where $d = o(\log n)$, we analyze the theoretical bounds of the space complexity as well. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the compression-expressivity tradeoff in tensor attention mechanisms and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient transformer architectures.

### Long Context Tuning for Video Generation
**Authors**: Yuwei Guo, Ceyuan Yang, Ziyan Yang, Zhibei Ma, Zhijie Lin, Zhenheng Yang, Dahua Lin, Lu Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T17:40:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in video generation can produce realistic, minute-long single-shot videos with scalable diffusion transformers. However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation. See https://guoyww.github.io/projects/long-context-video/ for more details.

### Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding
**Authors**: Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T17:19:51Z

**Summary**: We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

### ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion   Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Yuxuan Song, Yufei Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei-Ying Ma, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T16:29:17Z

**Summary**: We present ACDiT, a novel Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, that innovatively combines autoregressive and diffusion paradigms for modeling continuous visual information. By introducing a block-wise autoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of discrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a conditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on standard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive baselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT can be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel perspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for unified models.

### TokenCarve: Information-Preserving Visual Token Compression in   Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xudong Tan, Peng Ye, Chongjun Tu, Jianjian Cao, Yaoxin Yang, Lin Zhang, Dongzhan Zhou, Tao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T16:04:31Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming increasingly popular, while the high computational cost associated with multimodal data input, particularly from visual tokens, poses a significant challenge. Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It can even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count, achieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage, and only a 1.54% drop in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShawnTan86/TokenCarve.

### Source-primed Multi-turn Conversation Helps Large Language Models   Translate Documents
**Authors**: Hanxu Hu, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T15:57:50Z

**Summary**: LLMs have paved the way for truly simple document-level machine translation, but challenges such as omission errors remain. In this paper, we study a simple method for handling document-level machine translation, by leveraging previous contexts in a multi-turn conversational manner. Specifically, by decomposing documents into segments and iteratively translating them while maintaining previous turns, this method ensures coherent translations without additional training, and can fully re-use the KV cache of previous turns thus minimizing computational overhead. We further propose a `source-primed' method that first provides the whole source document before multi-turn translation. We empirically show this multi-turn method outperforms both translating entire documents in a single turn and translating each segment independently according to multiple automatic metrics in representative LLMs, establishing a strong baseline for document-level translation using LLMs.

### KV-Distill: Nearly Lossless Learnable Context Compression for LLMs
**Authors**: Vivek Chari, Guanghui Qin, Benjamin Van Durme

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T13:15:28Z

**Summary**: Sequence-to-sequence tasks often benefit from long contexts, but the quadratic complexity of self-attention in standard Transformers renders this non-trivial. During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures.

### EEdit : Rethinking the Spatial and Temporal Redundancy for Efficient   Image Editing
**Authors**: Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T11:26:45Z

**Summary**: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

### FlashRNN: I/O-Aware Optimization of Traditional RNNs on modern hardware
**Authors**: Korbinian Pöppel, Maximilian Beck, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T11:14:49Z

**Summary**: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T05:43:14Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MEDA: Dynamic KV Cache Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Hui Shen, Xin Wang, Che Liu, Zheda Mai, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T04:04:08Z

**Summary**: Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long text-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their multimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths, challenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in both text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations across layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies for layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic layer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context inference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to determine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically allocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection scheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that merges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the entire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82 times faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on various multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and long-video scenarios. Our code is released at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/MEDA.

### ZeroMerge: Parameter-Free KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient   Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Liu, Pei Liu, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T03:36:03Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often suffer from irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. We propose ZeroMerge, a dynamic zero-shot compression framework that achieves efficient cache management through three key innovations: (1) Fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) A residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) Parameter-free adaptation compatible with diverse LLM architectures without retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across LLaMA-2 model demonstrate that ZeroMerge maintains full-cache performance at 5\% compression ratios while doubling inference throughput at 40K token lengths. The method effectively balances memory efficiency, generation quality, and deployment flexibility, advancing practical long-context LLM applications. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZeroMerge.

### D2O: Dynamic Discriminative Operations for Efficient Long-Context   Inference of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Xinjian Wu, Yu Zhang, Yi Xin, Chaofan Tao, Zhihong Zhu, Xin Wang, Siqi Luo, Jing Xiong, Longyue Wang, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-13T03:16:43Z

**Summary**: Generative inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is impeded by the growing memory demands of Key-Value (KV) cache, especially for longer sequences. Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, leading to issues such as context loss or hallucinations. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Discriminative Operations (D2O), a KV cache compression method that optimizes KV cache size dynamically and discriminatively at two levels without fine-tuning, while preserving essential context. At layer level, D2O leverages the varying densities of attention weights between shallow and deep layers to dynamically determine which layers should avoid excessive eviction via a novel dynamic allocation strategy to minimize information loss. At token level, D2O incorporates a compensation mechanism that maintains a similarity threshold to re-discriminate the importance of currently discarded tokens, determining whether they should be recalled and merged with similar tokens. We conduct experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures. Our results show that D2O not only achieves significant memory savings and enhances inference throughput by more than 3$\times$ but also maintains high-quality long-text generation.

### MoE-Infinity: Efficient MoE Inference on Personal Machines with   Sparsity-Aware Expert Cache
**Authors**: Leyang Xue, Yao Fu, Zhan Lu, Luo Mai, Mahesh Marina

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T18:14:21Z

**Summary**: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an efficient MoE inference system designed for personal machines with limited GPU memory capacity. The key idea for MoE-Infinity is that on personal machines, which are often single-user environments, MoE-based LLMs typically operate with a batch size of one. In this setting, MoE models exhibit a high degree of activation sparsity, meaning a small number of experts are frequently reused in generating tokens during the decode phase. Leveraging this idea, we design a sparsity-aware expert cache, which can trace the sparse activation of experts during inference and carefully select the trace that represents the sparsity pattern. By analyzing these selected traces, MoE-Infinity guides the replacement and prefetching of the expert cache, providing 3.1-16.7x per-token latency improvements over numerous state-of-the-art systems, including vLLM, Ollama, DeepSpeed and BrainStorm across various MoE models (DeepSeek and Mixtral) when handling different LLM tasks. MoE-Infinity's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/EfficientMoE/MoE-Infinity

### PRISM: Efficient Long-Range Reasoning With Short-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T17:59:18Z

**Summary**: Long-range tasks demand reasoning over long inputs. Current solutions require large compute budgets, training data, model weight access, or complex task-specific designs. We introduce PRISM, which processes information as a stream of chunks while maintaining a structured in-context memory specified with a typed hierarchical schema. PRISM outperforms baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x shorter contexts than long-context models. This approach is token-efficient, producing concise outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54% compared to alternative short-context methods. PRISM scales down to tiny chunks (<500 tokens) without increasing encoding costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to new tasks with minimal effort by automatically generating schemas from task descriptions.

### N2C2: Nearest Neighbor Enhanced Confidence Calibration for Cross-Lingual   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Jie He, Simon Yu, Deyi Xiong, Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T10:05:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements of in-context learning (ICL) show language models can significantly improve their performance when demonstrations are provided. However, little attention has been paid to model calibration and prediction confidence of ICL in cross-lingual scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conduct a thorough analysis of ICL for cross-lingual sentiment classification. Our findings suggest that ICL performs poorly in cross-lingual scenarios, exhibiting low accuracy and presenting high calibration errors. In response, we propose a novel approach, N2C2, which employs a -nearest neighbors augmented classifier for prediction confidence calibration. N2C2 narrows the prediction gap by leveraging a datastore of cached few-shot instances. Specifically, N2C2 integrates the predictions from the datastore and incorporates confidence-aware distribution, semantically consistent retrieval representation, and adaptive neighbor combination modules to effectively utilize the limited number of supporting instances. Evaluation on two multilingual sentiment classification datasets demonstrates that N2C2 outperforms traditional ICL. It surpasses fine tuning, prompt tuning and recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and calibration errors.

### KV-Edit: Training-Free Image Editing for Precise Background Preservation
**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Jiawei Shao, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T07:23:32Z

**Summary**: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training.

### FasterCache: Training-Free Video Diffusion Model Acceleration with High   Quality
**Authors**: Zhengyao Lv, Chenyang Si, Junhao Song, Zhenyu Yang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu, Kwan-Yee K. Wong

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T03:40:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

**Authors**: Aparna Sasidharan, Xian-He, Jay Lofstead, Scott Klasky

**Updated**: 2025-03-12T00:12:39Z

**Summary**: This work describes the design, implementation and performance analysis of a distributed two-tiered storage software. The first tier functions as a distributed software cache implemented using solid-state devices~(NVMes) and the second tier consists of multiple hard disks~(HDDs). We describe an online learning algorithm that manages data movement between the tiers. The software is hybrid, i.e. both distributed and multi-threaded. The end-to-end performance model of the two-tier system was developed using queuing networks and behavioral models of storage devices. We identified significant parameters that affect the performance of storage devices and created behavioral models for each device. The performance of the software was evaluated on a many-core cluster using non-trivial read/write workloads. The paper provides examples to illustrate the use of these models.

**Summary**: Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT/LSMO/BCZT) sandwich films were elaborated using the sol-gel spin coating process. The dielectric properties displayed excellent thermal stability with the temperature coefficient of capacitance, TCC, remaining within 10% between -50 C and 300 C. The high energy storage density, Wrec, of 11.8 J/cm3 observed in this sandwich films, is nearly twice as high as that of the BCZT films, with an efficiency, n, of 77% under a weak electric field of 800 kV/cm. Furthermore, the stability of Wrec and n was observed along the studied temperature interval making them promising candidates for high-temperature energy storage capacitors.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval
**Authors**: Chuong Huynh, Jinyu Yang, Ashish Tawari, Mubarak Shah, Son Tran, Raffay Hamid, Trishul Chilimbi, Abhinav Shrivastava

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.

### Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution
**Authors**: Baifeng Shi, Boyi Li, Han Cai, Yao Lu, Sifei Liu, Marco Pavone, Jan Kautz, Song Han, Trevor Darrell, Pavlo Molchanov, Hongxu Yin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:58:37Z

**Summary**: High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.

### Non-minimally coupled gravity constraints from DESI DR2 data
**Authors**: Jiaming Pan, Gen Ye

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:56:31Z

**Summary**: It has been observed that the hint about phantom crossing in the DESI BAO observation might point to non-minimally coupled gravity. We analyzed DESI DR2 BAO together with CMB and Type Ia supernova data to constrain non-minimal coupling of gravity in the effective field theory (EFT) approach. Using a non-parametric method to infer the EFT functions, we found that with DESI BAO, DESY5 SN, and Planck CMB data the signal for non-minimal coupling reaches $\sim3\sigma$. It is found that current data can constrain up to the quadratic order $(n=2)$ if the EFT function representing non-minimal coupling is Taylor expanded as a general function of the dark energy fraction $\Omega_{\rm{DE}}$, i.e. $\Omega^{\text{EFT}}(a)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} c^{\rm{EFT}}_i \Omega^i_{\text{DE}}(a)$. This calls for a more flexible parametrization of the EFT functions than commonly used ones in literature.

### Right for Right Reasons: Large Language Models for Verifiable   Commonsense Knowledge Graph Question Answering
**Authors**: Armin Toroghi, Willis Guo, Mohammad Mahdi Abdollah Pour, Scott Sanner

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:44:19Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods seek to answer Natural Language questions using the relational information stored in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., "In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.

### CausalRAG: Integrating Causal Graphs into Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Nengbo Wang, Xiaotian Han, Jagdip Singh, Jing Ma, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:43:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances LLM capabilities by integrating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems face critical limitations, including disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking, and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval. To address these issues, we propose CausalRAG, a novel framework that incorporates causal graphs into the retrieval process. By constructing and tracing causal relationships, CausalRAG preserves contextual continuity and improves retrieval precision, leading to more accurate and interpretable responses. We evaluate CausalRAG against regular RAG and graph-based RAG approaches, demonstrating its superiority across several metrics. Our findings suggest that grounding retrieval in causal reasoning provides a promising approach to knowledge-intensive tasks.

### SLA-Awareness for AI-assisted coding
**Authors**: Kishanthan Thangarajah, Arthur Leung, Boyuan Chen, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:38:28Z

**Summary**: The integration of AI-assisted coding tools within development environments drastically reduces development time, and allows developers to focus more on creative and critical aspects of software engineering through the use of Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs). These coding assistants automate repetitive and time-consuming coding tasks such as code generation, code completion, code summarization, and code translation. Responsiveness is a crucial requirement of these coding assistants to maintain real-time interactivity, such that their use does not impede the developers' workflows. Different coding tasks have unique characteristics and latency requirements: Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) latency is essential for code completion tasks, while End-To-End (E2E) latency is crucial for code translation tasks. Managing these varying requirements simultaneously while optimizing resource usage poses significant challenges. Existing work adopts the Model-as-a-Service paradigm for serving individual CodeLLMs, but cannot effectively manage latency requirements of concurrent coding tasks and sequences of CodeLLM inference calls, due to a lack of end-to-end latency awareness. Another challenge is keeping resource utilization high, when the serving system is deployed on a shared cluster environment. To address these challenges, we propose Coding Assistant Task Orchestrator (CATO), a runtime system designed to serve a diverse assortment of coding tasks while meeting latency requirements and maximizing resource utilization. Our experiments demonstrate that when all types of coding tasks were served simultaneously, for TTFT-critical tasks, CATO improves overall Goodput rate and resource utilization by up to 10% and 41.1%, respectively. P95 E2E latency was also reduced by 18% for code summarization tasks, and P95 TTFT for code generation tasks were reduced by 14% compared against state-of-the-art systems.

### Verification and External Parameter Inference for Stochastic World   Models
**Authors**: Radu Calinescu, Sinem Getir Yaman, Simos Gerasimou, Gricel Vázquez, Micah Bassett

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:29:12Z

**Summary**: Given its ability to analyse stochastic models ranging from discrete and continuous-time Markov chains to Markov decision processes and stochastic games, probabilistic model checking (PMC) is widely used to verify system dependability and performance properties. However, modelling the behaviour of, and verifying these properties for many software-intensive systems requires the joint analysis of multiple interdependent stochastic models of different types, which existing PMC techniques and tools cannot handle. To address this limitation, we introduce a tool-supported UniversaL stochasTIc Modelling, verificAtion and synThEsis (ULTIMATE) framework that supports the representation, verification and synthesis of heterogeneous multi-model stochastic systems with complex model interdependencies. Through its unique integration of multiple PMC paradigms, and underpinned by a novel verification method for handling model interdependencies, ULTIMATE unifies-for the first time-the modelling of probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty, discrete and continuous time, partial observability, and the use of both Bayesian and frequentist inference to exploit domain knowledge and data about the modelled system and its context. A comprehensive suite of case studies and experiments confirm the generality and effectiveness of our novel verification framework.

### Think Twice: Enhancing LLM Reasoning by Scaling Multi-round Test-time   Thinking
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Tian, Sitong Zhao, Haotian Wang, Shuaiting Chen, Yunjie Ji, Yiping Peng, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:19:38Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques. The key prompt: {Original question prompt} The assistant's previous answer is: <answer> {last round answer} </answer>, and please re-answer.

### FALCONEye: Finding Answers and Localizing Content in ONE-hour-long   videos with multi-modal LLMs
**Authors**: Carlos Plou, Cesar Borja, Ruben Martinez-Cantin, Ana C. Murillo

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:17:19Z

**Summary**: Information retrieval in hour-long videos presents a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly when the desired information is localized within a small subset of frames. Long video data presents challenges for VLMs due to context window limitations and the difficulty of pinpointing frames containing the answer. Our novel video agent, FALCONEye, combines a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM) to search relevant information along the video, and locate the frames with the answer. FALCONEye novelty relies on 1) the proposed meta-architecture, which is better suited to tackle hour-long videos compared to short video approaches in the state-of-the-art; 2) a new efficient exploration algorithm to locate the information using short clips, captions and answer confidence; and 3) our state-of-the-art VLMs calibration analysis for the answer confidence. Our agent is built over a small-size VLM and a medium-size LLM being accessible to run on standard computational resources. We also release FALCON-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate long (average > 1 hour) Video Answer Search challenges, highlighting the need for open-ended question evaluation. Our experiments show FALCONEye's superior performance than the state-of-the-art in FALCON-Bench, and similar or better performance in related benchmarks.

### Approximate solutions of a general stochastic velocity-jump model   subject to discrete-time noisy observations
**Authors**: Arianna Ceccarelli, Alexander P. Browning, Ruth E. Baker

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:16:42Z

**Summary**: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures. These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for inference and model selection.

### A Comparative Analysis of Word Segmentation, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and   Named Entity Recognition for Historical Chinese Sources, 1900-1950
**Authors**: Zhao Fang, Liang-Chun Wu, Xuening Kong, Spencer Dean Stewart

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:07:21Z

**Summary**: This paper compares large language models (LLMs) and traditional natural language processing (NLP) tools for performing word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) on Chinese texts from 1900 to 1950. Historical Chinese documents pose challenges for text analysis due to their logographic script, the absence of natural word boundaries, and significant linguistic changes. Using a sample dataset from the Shanghai Library Republican Journal corpus, traditional tools such as Jieba and spaCy are compared to LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and the GLM series. The results show that LLMs outperform traditional methods in all metrics, albeit at considerably higher computational costs, highlighting a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, LLMs better handle genre-specific challenges such as poetry and temporal variations (i.e., pre-1920 versus post-1920 texts), demonstrating that their contextual learning capabilities can advance NLP approaches to historical texts by reducing the need for domain-specific training data.

### Decomposing The Dark Matter of Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Joshua Engels, Logan Riggs, Max Tegmark

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:00:02Z

**Summary**: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising technique for decomposing language model activations into interpretable linear features. However, current SAEs fall short of completely explaining model performance, resulting in "dark matter": unexplained variance in activations. This work investigates dark matter as an object of study in its own right. Surprisingly, we find that much of SAE dark matter -- about half of the error vector itself and >90% of its norm -- can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector. Additionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a per token level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle to reconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linear representation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead to these observations. These insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector that cannot be linearly predicted ("nonlinear" error) might be fundamentally different from the linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis, we empirically analyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer not yet learned features, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, and 3) it is responsible for a proportional amount of the downstream increase in cross entropy loss when SAE activations are inserted into the model. Finally, we examine two methods to reduce nonlinear SAE error: inference time gradient pursuit, which leads to a very slight decrease in nonlinear error, and linear transformations from earlier layer SAE outputs, which leads to a larger reduction.

### FireEdit: Fine-grained Instruction-based Image Editing via Region-aware   Vision Language Model
**Authors**: Jun Zhou, Jiahao Li, Zunnan Xu, Hanhui Li, Yiji Cheng, Fa-Ting Hong, Qin Lin, Qinglin Lu, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:59:42Z

**Summary**: Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant progress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods. Our project is available at https://zjgans.github.io/fireedit.github.io.

### Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees
**Authors**: Matthew J Penn, Neil Scheidwasser, Mark P Khurana, David A Duchêne, Christl A Donnelly, Samir Bhatt

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:44:19Z

**Summary**: Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are central to understanding the shared history among evolutionary units. However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.

### $\texttt{synax}$: A Differentiable and GPU-accelerated Synchrotron   Simulation Package
**Authors**: Kangning Diao, Zack Li, Richard D. P. Grumitt, Yi Mao

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:32:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce synax, a novel library for automatically differentiable simulation of Galactic synchrotron emission. Built on the JAX framework, synax leverages JAX's capabilities, including batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and hardware-specific optimizations (CPU, GPU, TPU). Crucially, synax uses JAX's automatic differentiation (AD) mechanism, enabling precise computation of derivatives with respect to any model parameters. This feature facilitates powerful inference algorithms, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and gradient-based optimization, which enables inference over models that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. In its initial release, synax supports synchrotron intensity and polarization calculations down to GHz frequencies, alongside several models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), cosmic ray (CR) spectra, and thermal electron density fields. We demonstrate the transformative potential of AD for tasks involving full posterior inference using gradient-based techniques or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) optimization. Notably, we show that GPU acceleration brings a twenty-fold enhancement in efficiency, while HMC achieves a two-fold improvement over standard random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) when performing inference over a four-parameter test model. HMC still works on a more complex, 16-parameter model while RWMH fails to converge. Additionally, we showcase the application of synax in optimizing the GMF based on the Haslam 408 MHz map, achieving residuals with a standard deviation below 1 K.

### LLM4DV: Using Large Language Models for Hardware Test Stimuli Generation
**Authors**: Zixi Zhang, Balint Szekely, Pedro Gimenes, Greg Chadwick, Hugo McNally, Jianyi Cheng, Robert Mullins, Yiren Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:32:46Z

**Summary**: Hardware design verification (DV) is a process that checks the functional equivalence of a hardware design against its specifications, improving hardware reliability and robustness. A key task in the DV process is the test stimuli generation, which creates a set of conditions or inputs for testing. These test conditions are often complex and specific to the given hardware design, requiring substantial human engineering effort to optimize. We seek a solution of automated and efficient testing for arbitrary hardware designs that takes advantage of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have already shown promising results for improving hardware design automation, but remain under-explored for hardware DV. In this paper, we propose an open-source benchmarking framework named LLM4DV that efficiently orchestrates LLMs for automated hardware test stimuli generation. Our analysis evaluates six different LLMs involving six prompting improvements over eight hardware designs and provides insight for future work on LLMs development for efficient automated DV.

**Summary**: White blood cell (WBC) classification plays a vital role in hematology for diagnosing various medical conditions. However, it faces significant challenges due to domain shifts caused by variations in sample sources (e.g., blood or bone marrow) and differing imaging conditions across hospitals. Traditional deep learning models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in such dynamic environments, while foundation models, though generally robust, experience performance degradation when the distribution of inference data differs from that of the training data. To address these challenges, we propose a generative replay-based Continual Learning (CL) strategy designed to prevent forgetting in foundation models for WBC classification. Our method employs lightweight generators to mimic past data with a synthetic latent representation to enable privacy-preserving replay. To showcase the effectiveness, we carry out extensive experiments with a total of four datasets with different task ordering and four backbone models including ResNet50, RetCCL, CTransPath, and UNI. Experimental results demonstrate that conventional fine-tuning methods degrade performance on previously learned tasks and struggle with domain shifts. In contrast, our continual learning strategy effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, preserving model performance across varying domains. This work presents a practical solution for maintaining reliable WBC classification in real-world clinical settings, where data distributions frequently evolve.

### FREE-Merging: Fourier Transform for Efficient Model Merging
**Authors**: Shenghe Zheng, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:19:52Z

**Summary**: With the rapid growth of deep learning, there is an increasing availability of open-source models for various tasks. However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs.

**Authors**: Chen-Wei Chang, Cheng-De Fan, Chia-Che Chang, Yi-Chen Lo, Yu-Chee Tseng, Jiun-Long Huang, Yu-Lun Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:17:47Z

**Summary**: Color constancy methods often struggle to generalize across different camera sensors due to varying spectral sensitivities. We present GCC, which leverages diffusion models to inpaint color checkers into images for illumination estimation. Our key innovations include (1) a single-step deterministic inference approach that inpaints color checkers reflecting scene illumination, (2) a Laplacian decomposition technique that preserves checker structure while allowing illumination-dependent color adaptation, and (3) a mask-based data augmentation strategy for handling imprecise color checker annotations. By harnessing rich priors from pre-trained diffusion models, GCC demonstrates strong robustness in challenging cross-camera scenarios. These results highlight our method's effective generalization capability across different camera characteristics without requiring sensor-specific training, making it a versatile and practical solution for real-world applications.

### PAVE: Patching and Adapting Video Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhuoming Liu, Yiquan Li, Khoi Duc Nguyen, Yiwu Zhong, Yin Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:02:37Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained video large language models (Video LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet adapting these models to new tasks involving additional modalities or data types (e.g., audio or 3D information) remains challenging. In this paper, we present PAVE, a flexible framework for adapting pre-trained Video LLMs to downstream tasks with side-channel signals, such as audio, 3D cues, or multi-view videos. PAVE introduces lightweight adapters, referred to as "patches," which add a small number of parameters and operations to a base model without modifying its architecture or pre-trained weights. In doing so, PAVE can effectively adapt the pre-trained base model to support diverse downstream tasks, including audio-visual question answering, 3D reasoning, multi-view video recognition, and high frame rate video understanding. Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance of the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while incurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters. Further, PAVE supports multi-task learning and generalizes well across different Video LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/dragonlzm/PAVE.

### Decorum: A Language-Based Approach For Style-Conditioned Synthesis of   Indoor 3D Scenes
**Authors**: Kelly O. Marshall, Omid Poursaeed, Sergiu Oprea, Amit Kumar, Anushrut Jignasu, Chinmay Hegde, Yilei Li, Rakesh Ranjan

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:58:36Z

**Summary**: 3D indoor scene generation is an important problem for the design of digital and real-world environments. To automate this process, a scene generation model should be able to not only generate plausible scene layouts, but also take into consideration visual features and style preferences. Existing methods for this task exhibit very limited control over these attributes, only allowing text inputs in the form of simple object-level descriptions or pairwise spatial relationships. Our proposed method Decorum enables users to control the scene generation process with natural language by adopting language-based representations at each stage. This enables us to harness recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to model language-to-language mappings. In addition, we show that using a text-based representation allows us to select furniture for our scenes using a novel object retrieval method based on multimodal LLMs. Evaluations on the benchmark 3D-FRONT dataset show that our methods achieve improvements over existing work in text-conditioned scene synthesis and object retrieval.

**Authors**: Yonglin Tian, Fei Lin, Yiduo Li, Tengchao Zhang, Qiyao Zhang, Xuan Fu, Jun Huang, Xingyuan Dai, Yutong Wang, Chunwei Tian, Bai Li, Yisheng Lv, Levente Kovács, Fei-Yue Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:55:33Z

**Summary**: Low-altitude mobility, exemplified by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has introduced transformative advancements across various domains, like transportation, logistics, and agriculture. Leveraging flexible perspectives and rapid maneuverability, UAVs extend traditional systems' perception and action capabilities, garnering widespread attention from academia and industry. However, current UAV operations primarily depend on human control, with only limited autonomy in simple scenarios, and lack the intelligence and adaptability needed for more complex environments and tasks. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable problem-solving and generalization capabilities, offering a promising pathway for advancing UAV intelligence. This paper explores the integration of LLMs and UAVs, beginning with an overview of UAV systems' fundamental components and functionalities, followed by an overview of the state-of-the-art in LLM technology. Subsequently, it systematically highlights the multimodal data resources available for UAVs, which provide critical support for training and evaluation. Furthermore, it categorizes and analyzes key tasks and application scenarios where UAVs and LLMs converge. Finally, a reference roadmap towards agentic UAVs is proposed, aiming to enable UAVs to achieve agentic intelligence through autonomous perception, memory, reasoning, and tool utilization.

### LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary   Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Vladan Stojnić, Yannis Kalantidis, Jiří Matas, Giorgos Tolias

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:47:13Z

**Summary**: We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS

### Empowering LLMs to Understand and Generate Complex Vector Graphics
**Authors**: Ximing Xing, Juncheng Hu, Guotao Liang, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu, Qian Yu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:35:29Z

**Summary**: The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly impacted natural language processing but have yet to fully embrace the realm of scalable vector graphics (SVG) generation. While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training, recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions. Additionally, LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths, which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives. In this paper, we present LLM4SVG, an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics. LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens, which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs. Using a series of learnable semantic tokens, a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models, integrating semantic tags, vector instruction encoders, fine-tuned commands, and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric, appearance, and language information. To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected our SVGX-SFT Dataset, consisting of high-quality human-designed SVGs and 580k SVG instruction following data specifically crafted for LLM training, which facilitated the adoption of the supervised fine-tuning strategy popular in LLM development.

### ORION: A Holistic End-to-End Autonomous Driving Framework by   Vision-Language Instructed Action Generation
**Authors**: Haoyu Fu, Diankun Zhang, Zongchuang Zhao, Jianfeng Cui, Dingkang Liang, Chong Zhang, Dingyuan Zhang, Hongwei Xie, Bing Wang, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:18:43Z

**Summary**: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving methods still struggle to make correct decisions in interactive closed-loop evaluation due to limited causal reasoning capability. Current methods attempt to leverage the powerful understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to resolve this dilemma. However, the problem is still open that few VLMs for E2E methods perform well in the closed-loop evaluation due to the gap between the semantic reasoning space and the purely numerical trajectory output in the action space. To tackle this issue, we propose ORION, a holistic E2E autonomous driving framework by vision-language instructed action generation. ORION uniquely combines a QT-Former to aggregate long-term history context, a Large Language Model (LLM) for driving scenario reasoning, and a generative planner for precision trajectory prediction. ORION further aligns the reasoning space and the action space to implement a unified E2E optimization for both visual question-answering (VQA) and planning tasks. Our method achieves an impressive closed-loop performance of 77.74 Driving Score (DS) and 54.62% Success Rate (SR) on the challenge Bench2Drive datasets, which outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin of 14.28 DS and 19.61% SR.

**Authors**: Lewis Newsham, Ryan Hyland, Daniel Prince

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:16:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents SANDMAN, an architecture for cyber deception that leverages Language Agents to emulate convincing human simulacra. Our 'Deceptive Agents' serve as advanced cyber decoys, designed for high-fidelity engagement with attackers by extending the observation period of attack behaviours. Through experimentation, measurement, and analysis, we demonstrate how a prompt schema based on the five-factor model of personality systematically induces distinct 'personalities' in Large Language Models. Our results highlight the feasibility of persona-driven Language Agents for generating diverse, realistic behaviours, ultimately improving cyber deception strategies.

### No-prior Bayesian inference reIMagined: probabilistic approximations of   inferential models
**Authors**: Ryan Martin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:11:14Z

**Summary**: When prior information is lacking, the go-to strategy for probabilistic inference is to combine a "default prior" and the likelihood via Bayes's theorem. Objective Bayes, (generalized) fiducial inference, etc. fall under this umbrella. This construction is natural, but the corresponding posterior distributions generally only offer limited, approximately valid uncertainty quantification. The present paper takes a reimagined approach offering posterior distributions with stronger reliability properties. The proposed construction starts with an inferential model (IM), one that takes the mathematical form of a data-driven possibility measure and features exactly valid uncertainty quantification, and then returns a so-called inner probabilistic approximation thereof. This inner probabilistic approximation inherits many of the original IM's desirable properties, including credible sets with exact coverage and asymptotic efficiency. The approximation also agrees with the familiar Bayes/fiducial solution obtained in applications where the model has a group transformation structure. A Monte Carlo method for evaluating the probabilistic approximation is presented, along with numerical illustrations.

### Doc2OracLL: Investigating the Impact of Documentation on LLM-based Test   Oracle Generation
**Authors**: Soneya Binta Hossain, Raygan Taylor, Matthew Dwyer

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:10:24Z

**Summary**: Code documentation is a critical aspect of software development, serving as a bridge between human understanding and machine-readable code. Beyond assisting developers in understanding and maintaining code, documentation also plays a critical role in automating various software engineering tasks, such as test oracle generation (TOG). In Java, Javadoc comments provide structured, natural language documentation embedded directly in the source code, typically detailing functionality, usage, parameters, return values, and exceptions. While prior research has utilized Javadoc comments in test oracle generation (TOG), there has not been a thorough investigation into their impact when combined with other contextual information, nor into identifying the most relevant components for generating correct and strong test oracles, or understanding their role in detecting real bugs. In this study, we dive deep into investigating the impact of Javadoc comments on TOG.

### Optimizing Photonic Structures with Large Language Model Driven   Algorithm Discovery
**Authors**: Haoran Yin, Anna V. Kononova, Thomas Bäck, Niki van Stein

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:05:25Z

**Summary**: We study how large language models can be used in combination with evolutionary computation techniques to automatically discover optimization algorithms for the design of photonic structures. Building on the Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, we introduce structured prompt engineering tailored to multilayer photonic problems such as Bragg mirror, ellipsometry inverse analysis, and solar cell antireflection coatings. We systematically explore multiple evolutionary strategies, including (1+1), (1+5), (2+10), and others, to balance exploration and exploitation. Our experiments show that LLM-generated algorithms, generated using small-scale problem instances, can match or surpass established methods like quasi-oppositional differential evolution on large-scale realistic real-world problem instances. Notably, LLaMEA's self-debugging mutation loop, augmented by automatically extracted problem-specific insights, achieves strong anytime performance and reliable convergence across diverse problem scales. This work demonstrates the feasibility of domain-focused LLM prompts and evolutionary approaches in solving optical design tasks, paving the way for rapid, automated photonic inverse design.

### MIRROR: A Novel Approach for the Automated Evaluation of Open-Ended   Question Generation
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity, Sudeshna Sarkar

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:02:17Z

**Summary**: Automatic question generation is a critical task that involves evaluating question quality by considering factors such as engagement, pedagogical value, and the ability to stimulate critical thinking. These aspects require human-like understanding and judgment, which automated systems currently lack. However, human evaluations are costly and impractical for large-scale samples of generated questions. Therefore, we propose a novel system, MIRROR (Multi-LLM Iterative Review and Response for Optimized Rating), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the evaluation process for questions generated by automated question generation systems. We experimented with several state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama2-70b. We observed that the scores of human evaluation metrics, namely relevance, appropriateness, novelty, complexity, and grammaticality, improved when using the feedback-based approach called MIRROR, tending to be closer to the human baseline scores. Furthermore, we observed that Pearson's correlation coefficient between GPT-4 and human experts improved when using our proposed feedback-based approach, MIRROR, compared to direct prompting for evaluation. Error analysis shows that our proposed approach, MIRROR, significantly helps to improve relevance and appropriateness.

### DeltaZip: Efficient Serving of Multiple Full-Model-Tuned LLMs
**Authors**: Xiaozhe Yao, Qinghao Hu, Ana Klimovic

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:48:01Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) greatly improves model quality for downstream tasks. However, serving many fine-tuned LLMs concurrently is challenging due to the sporadic, bursty, and varying request patterns of different LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present DeltaZip, an LLM serving system that efficiently serves multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models concurrently by aggressively compressing model deltas by up to 10x while maintaining high model quality. The key insight behind this design is that fine-tuning results in small-magnitude changes to the pre-trained model. By co-designing the serving system with the compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves 2x to 12x improvement in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art systems.

### Enhancing Persona Consistency for LLMs' Role-Playing using Persona-Aware   Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Ke Ji, Yixin Lian, Linxu Li, Jingsheng Gao, Weiyuan Li, Bin Dai

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:43:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough progress in many dialogue generation tasks. However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.

Sand, Manisha Shrestha, Giacomo Terreran, Stefano Valenti, Samuel Wyatt, Yi Yang, WeiKang Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:42:14Z

**Summary**: While the subclass of interacting supernovae with narrow hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) consists of some of the longest-lasting and brightest SNe ever discovered, their progenitors are still not well understood. Investigating SNe IIn as they emit across the electromagnetic spectrum is the most robust way to understand the progenitor evolution before the explosion. This work presents X-Ray, optical, infrared, and radio observations of the strongly interacting Type IIn SN 2020ywx covering a period $>1200$ days after discovery. Through multiwavelength modeling, we find that the progenitor of 2020ywx was losing mass at $\sim10^{-2}$--$10^{-3} \mathrm{\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ for at least 100 yrs pre-explosion using the circumstellar medium (CSM) speed of 120 km/s measured from our optical and NIR spectra. Despite the similar magnitude of mass loss measured in different wavelength ranges, we find discrepancies between the X-ray and optical/radio-derived mass-loss evolution, which suggest asymmetries in the CSM. Furthermore, we find evidence for dust formation due to the combination of a growing blueshift in optical emission lines and near-infrared continuum emission which we fit with blackbodies at $\sim$ 1000 K. Based on the observed elevated mass loss over more than 100 years and the configuration of the CSM inferred from the multiwavelength observations, we invoke binary interaction as the most plausible mechanism to explain the overall mass-loss evolution. SN 2020ywx is thus a case that may support the growing observational consensus that SNe IIn mass loss is explained by binary interaction.

### Writing as a testbed for open ended agents
**Authors**: Sian Gooding, Lucia Lopez-Rivilla, Edward Grefenstette

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:38:36Z

**Summary**: Open-ended tasks are particularly challenging for LLMs due to the vast solution space, demanding both expansive exploration and adaptable strategies, especially when success lacks a clear, objective definition. Writing, with its vast solution space and subjective evaluation criteria, provides a compelling testbed for studying such problems. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs to act as collaborative co-writers, capable of suggesting and implementing text improvements autonomously. We analyse three prominent LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4o - focusing on how their action diversity, human alignment, and iterative improvement capabilities impact overall performance. This work establishes a framework for benchmarking autonomous writing agents and, more broadly, highlights fundamental challenges and potential solutions for building systems capable of excelling in diverse open-ended domains.

### Spectral classification of young stars using conditional invertible   neural networks II. Application to Trumpler 14 in Carina
**Authors**: Da Eun Kang, Dominika Itrich, Victor F. Ksoll, Leonardo Testi, Ralf S. Klessen, Sergio Molinari

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:25:32Z

**Summary**: We introduce an updated version of our deep learning tool that predicts stellar parameters from the optical spectra of young low-mass stars with intermediate spectral resolution. We adopt a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) architecture to infer the posterior distribution of stellar parameters and train our cINN on two Phoenix stellar atmosphere model libraries (Settl and Dusty). Compared to the cINNs presented in our first study, the updated cINN considers the influence of the relative flux error on the parameter estimation and predicts an additional fourth parameter, veiling. We test the performance of cINN on synthetic test models to quantify the intrinsic error of the cINN as a function of relative flux error and on 36 class III template stars to validate the performance on real spectra. Using our cINN, we estimate the stellar parameters of young stars in Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the Carina Nebula Complex, observed with VLT-MUSE, and compare them with those derived using the classical template fitting method. We provide Teff, log g, Av, and veiling values measured by our cINN as well as stellar ages and masses derived from the HR diagram. Our parameter estimates generally agree well with those measured by template fitting. However, for K- and G-type stars, the Teff derived from template fitting is, on average, 2-3 subclasses hotter than the cINN estimates, while the corresponding veiling values from template fitting appear to be underestimated compared to the cINN predictions. We obtain an average age of 0.7(+3.2)(-0.6) Myr for the Tr14 stars. By examining the impact of veiling on the equivalent width-based classification, we demonstrate that the main cause of temperature overestimation for K- and G-type stars in the previous study is that veiling and effective temperature are not considered simultaneously in their process.

### Structuring Scientific Innovation: A Framework for Modeling and   Discovering Impactful Knowledge Combinations
**Authors**: Junlan Chen, Kexin Zhang, Daifeng Li, Yangyang Feng, Yuxuan Zhang, Bowen Deng

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:21:15Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models offers new possibilities for structured exploration of scientific knowledge. Rather than viewing scientific discovery as isolated ideas or content, we propose a structured approach that emphasizes the role of method combinations in shaping disruptive insights. Specifically, we investigate how knowledge unit--especially those tied to methodological design--can be modeled and recombined to yield research breakthroughs. Our proposed framework addresses two key challenges. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based mechanism to identify distinguishing features of historically disruptive method combinations within problem-driven contexts. Second, we propose a reasoning-guided Monte Carlo search algorithm that leverages the chain-of-thought capability of LLMs to identify promising knowledge recombinations for new problem statements.Empirical studies across multiple domains show that the framework is capable of modeling the structural dynamics of innovation and successfully highlights combinations with high disruptive potential. This research provides a new path for computationally guided scientific ideation grounded in structured reasoning and historical data modeling.

### Federated Causal Inference: Multi-Study ATE Estimation beyond   Meta-Analysis
**Authors**: Rémi Khellaf, Aurélien Bellet, Julie Josse

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:18:33Z

**Summary**: We study Federated Causal Inference, an approach to estimate treatment effects from decentralized data across centers. We compare three classes of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimators derived from the Plug-in G-Formula, ranging from simple meta-analysis to one-shot and multi-shot federated learning, the latter leveraging the full data to learn the outcome model (albeit requiring more communication). Focusing on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), we derive the asymptotic variance of these estimators for linear models. Our results provide practical guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator for various scenarios, including heterogeneity in sample sizes, covariate distributions, treatment assignment schemes, and center effects. We validate these findings with a simulation study.

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:18:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general purpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance

### Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path   Signatures
**Authors**: Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:02:42Z

**Summary**: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.

**Authors**: Eshed Gal, Moshe Eliasof, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Eldad Haber, Eran Treister

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T10:39:33Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for learning and inferring from graph-structured data, and are widely used in a variety of applications, often considering large amounts of data and large graphs. However, training on such data requires large memory and extensive computations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for efficient multiscale training of GNNs, designed to integrate information across multiscale representations of a graph. Our approach leverages a hierarchical graph representation, taking advantage of coarse graph scales in the training process, where each coarse scale graph has fewer nodes and edges. Based on this approach, we propose a suite of GNN training methods: such as coarse-to-fine, sub-to-full, and multiscale gradient computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on various datasets and learning tasks.

**Authors**: Ruichuan An, Sihan Yang, Ming Lu, Renrui Zhang, Kai Zeng, Yulin Luo, Jiajun Cao, Hao Liang, Ying Chen, Qi She, Shanghang Zhang, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:50:20Z

**Summary**: Current vision-language models (VLMs) show exceptional abilities across diverse tasks, such as visual question answering. To enhance user experience, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, they mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits real-world applicability. This paper proposes the first multi-concept personalization paradigm, MC-LLaVA. Specifically, MC-LLaVA employs a multi-concept instruction tuning strategy, effectively integrating multiple concepts in a single training step. To reduce the costs related to joint training, we propose a personalized textual prompt that uses visual token information to initialize concept tokens. Additionally, we introduce a personalized visual prompt during inference, aggregating location confidence maps for enhanced recognition and grounding capabilities. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality instruction tuning dataset. We carefully collect images with multiple characters and objects from movies and manually generate question-answer samples for multi-concept scenarios, featuring superior diversity. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA}.

### Enhancing Graphical Lasso: A Robust Scheme for Non-Stationary Mean Data
**Authors**: Samuel Rey, Ernesto Curbelo, Luca Martino, Fernando Llorente, Antonio G. Marques

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:40:59Z

**Summary**: This work addresses the problem of graph learning from data following a Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) with a time-varying mean. Graphical Lasso (GL), the standard method for estimating sparse precision matrices, assumes that the observed data follows a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. However, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios where the mean evolves over time due to external influences, trends, or regime shifts. When the mean is not properly accounted for, applying GL directly can lead to estimating a biased precision matrix, hence hindering the graph learning task. To overcome this limitation, we propose Graphical Lasso with Adaptive Targeted Adaptive Importance Sampling (GL-ATAIS), an iterative method that jointly estimates the time-varying mean and the precision matrix. Our approach integrates Bayesian inference with frequentist estimation, leveraging importance sampling to obtain an estimate of the mean while using a regularized maximum likelihood estimator to infer the precision matrix. By iteratively refining both estimates, GL-ATAIS mitigates the bias introduced by time-varying means, leading to more accurate graph recovery. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates the impact of properly accounting for time-dependent means and highlights the advantages of GL-ATAIS over standard GL in recovering the true graph structure.

### HausaNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Towards a Fine-Grained Model-Aware   Hallucination Detection
**Authors**: Maryam Bala, Amina Imam Abubakar, Abdulhamid Abubakar, Abdulkadir Shehu Bichi, Hafsa Kabir Ahmad, Sani Abdullahi Sani, Idris Abdulmumin, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhamad, Ibrahim Said Ahmad

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:40:22Z

**Summary**: This paper presents our findings of the Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, MU-SHROOM, which focuses on identifying hallucinations and related overgeneration errors in large language models (LLMs). The shared task involves detecting specific text spans that constitute hallucinations in the outputs generated by LLMs in 14 languages. To address this task, we aim to provide a nuanced, model-aware understanding of hallucination occurrences and severity in English. We used natural language inference and fine-tuned a ModernBERT model using a synthetic dataset of 400 samples, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.032 and a correlation score of 0.422. These results indicate a moderately positive correlation between the model's confidence scores and the actual presence of hallucinations. The IoU score indicates that our model has a relatively low overlap between the predicted hallucination span and the truth annotation. The performance is unsurprising, given the intricate nature of hallucination detection. Hallucinations often manifest subtly, relying on context, making pinpointing their exact boundaries formidable.

**Authors**: Yiheng Zhong, Zihong Luo, Chengzhi Liu, Feilong Tang, Zelin Peng, Ming Hu, Yingzhen Hu, Jionglong Su, Zongyuan Geand, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:25:06Z

**Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates powerful zero-shot capabilities; however, its accuracy and robustness significantly decrease when applied to medical image segmentation. Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our anonymous code is released at https://github.com/logan-0623/PG-SAM.

**Authors**: Han Zhao, Haotian Wang, Yiping Peng, Sitong Zhao, Xiaoyu Tian, Shuaiting Chen, Yunjie Ji, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:19:46Z

**Summary**: The AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled is a large-scale dataset with thinking traces for general reasoning tasks, composed of high-quality and challenging reasoning problems. These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well. We are releasing these 1.4 million problems and their corresponding responses to the research community with the objective of fostering the development of powerful reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset was published in \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-1.4M}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-1.4M}.

### Hierarchical Contextual Manifold Alignment for Structuring Latent   Representations in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Meiquan Dong, Haoran Liu, Yan Huang, Zixuan Feng, Jianhong Tang, Ruoxi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:13:51Z

**Summary**: The organization of latent token representations plays a crucial role in determining the stability, generalization, and contextual consistency of language models, yet conventional approaches to embedding refinement often rely on parameter modifications that introduce additional computational overhead. A hierarchical alignment method was introduced to restructure token embeddings without altering core model weights, ensuring that representational distributions maintained coherence across different linguistic contexts. Experimental evaluations demonstrated improvements in rare token retrieval, adversarial robustness, and long-range dependency tracking, highlighting the advantages of hierarchical structuring in mitigating inconsistencies in latent space organization. The comparative analysis against conventional fine-tuning and embedding perturbation methods revealed that hierarchical restructuring maintained computational efficiency while achieving measurable gains in representation quality. Structural refinements introduced through the alignment process resulted in improved contextual stability across varied linguistic tasks, reducing inconsistencies in token proximity relationships and enhancing interpretability in language generation. A detailed computational assessment confirmed that the realignment process introduced minimal inference overhead, ensuring that representational improvements did not compromise model efficiency. The findings reinforced the broader significance of structured representation learning, illustrating that hierarchical embedding modifications could serve as an effective strategy for refining latent space distributions while preserving pre-learned semantic associations.

### Structured Token Retention and Computational Memory Paths in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Jonathan Delena, Augustin Moreau, Dominic Ravensdale, Frederick Chatterton

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:12:11Z

**Summary**: Memory retention mechanisms play a central role in determining the efficiency of computational architectures designed for processing extended sequences. Conventional methods for token management often impose fixed retention thresholds or rely on uniform attention weight distributions, leading to inefficient memory utilization and premature information loss in extended sequence modeling. Structured Token Retention (STR) introduces a probabilistic selection framework that dynamically adjusts token persistence based on contextual significance, ensuring that computational resources are allocated to semantically relevant elements. Computational Memory Paths (CMP) extend this framework through hierarchical memory allocation, refining retention efficiency through structured reallocation of token embeddings. Comparative assessments against baseline models demonstrate that STR and CMP improve token survival rates across long input sequences while reducing cumulative error propagation across processing layers. Experimental results further indicate reductions in computational overhead, improving inference speed without degrading contextual coherence. Token distribution analyses reveal that structured memory allocation prevents excessive redundancy in attention weight calculations, optimizing information retrieval efficiency in large-scale generative architectures. The integration of STR and CMP into an open-source model illustrates the adaptability of structured memory retention methodologies, highlighting their applicability in generative text processing, long-context comprehension, and scalable sequence modeling.

### Semantic Entanglement-Based Ransomware Detection via Probabilistic   Latent Encryption Mapping
**Authors**: Mohammad Eisa, Quentin Yardley, Rafael Witherspoon, Harriet Pendlebury, Clement Rutherford

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:11:30Z

**Summary**: Encryption-based attacks have introduced significant challenges for detection mechanisms that rely on predefined signatures, heuristic indicators, or static rule-based classifications. Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an alternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption behaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and probabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function call monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption anomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring greater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate that entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and encryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the framework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and adversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification performance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution environments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling exhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection approaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques and adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis confirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility constraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption classification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to systematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static attack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion techniques.

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:08:46Z

**Summary**: The optimization of nuclear engineering designs, such as nuclear fuel assembly configurations, involves managing competing objectives like reactivity control and power distribution. This study explores the use of Optimization by Prompting, an iterative approach utilizing large language models (LLMs), to address these challenges. The method is straightforward to implement, requiring no hyperparameter tuning or complex mathematical formulations. Optimization problems can be described in plain English, with only an evaluator and a parsing script needed for execution. The in-context learning capabilities of LLMs enable them to understand problem nuances, therefore, they have the potential to surpass traditional metaheuristic optimization methods. This study demonstrates the application of LLMs as optimizers to Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel lattice design, showing the capability of commercial LLMs to achieve superior optimization results compared to traditional methods.

### Exploring Next Token Prediction For Optimizing Databases
**Authors**: Yeasir Rayhan, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:08:26Z

**Summary**: The Next Token Prediction paradigm (NTP, for short) lies at the forefront of modern large foundational models that are pre-trained on diverse and large datasets. These models generalize effectively and have proven to be very successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Inspired by the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate whether the same NTP paradigm can also be applied to DBMS design and optimization tasks. Adopting NTP directly for database optimization is non-trivial due to the fundamental differences between the domains. In this paper, we present a framework termed Probe and Learn (PoLe) for applying NTP to optimize database systems. PoLe leverages Decision Transformers and hardware-generated tokens to effectively incorporate NTP into database systems. Preliminary results from the main-memory index scheduling task demonstrate that adopting NTP can improve both performance and generalizability.

### Learning to chain-of-thought with Jensen's evidence lower bound
**Authors**: Yunhao Tang, Sid Wang, Rémi Munos

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:03:09Z

**Summary**: We propose a way to optimize chain-of-thought with reinforcement learning, but without external reward function. Our algorithm relies on viewing chain-of-thought as latent variable as part of a probabilistic inference problem. Contrary to the full evidence lower bound, we propose to apply a much simpler Jensen's lower bound, which derives tractable objectives with simple algorithmic components (e.g., without the need for parametric approximate posterior), making it more conducive to modern large-scale training. The lower bound approach naturally interpolates other methods such as supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning, whose practical trade-offs we will illustrate. Finally, we show that on mathematical reasoning problems, optimizing with Jensen's lower bound is as effective as policy gradient with external reward. Taken together, our results showcase as a proof of concept to this new algorithmic paradigm's potential to more generic applications.

### Structural Latency Perturbation in Large Language Models Through   Recursive State Induction
**Authors**: Michael Mangrum, Jonathan Pemberton, Benedict Wetherby, Philip Montague

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:00:06Z

**Summary**: Computational efficiency has remained a critical consideration in scaling high-capacity language models, with inference latency and resource consumption presenting significant constraints on real-time applications. The study has introduced a structured latency perturbation mechanism that modifies computational pathways through recursive state induction, enabling dynamic suppression of redundant activations while preserving generative fidelity. A formal mathematical framework has been established to describe recursive perturbations, ensuring that modifications remain adaptive rather than statically imposed. Experiments have demonstrated that applying recursive state adjustments reduces inference latency across varying sequence lengths, with longer text generations benefiting from cumulative efficiency improvements. Comparative evaluations against structured pruning and quantization have indicated that latency gains can be achieved without compromising token retention or memory utilization. The analysis of computational overhead has suggested that selectively suppressing redundant activations contributes to improved power efficiency, particularly in scenarios requiring extended text generation. An assessment of linguistic stability has shown that token-level consistency remains largely intact under controlled perturbation thresholds, reinforcing the viability of structural latency modifications as an alternative to weight-centric optimization techniques. The results have supported the hypothesis that recursive state induction offers an effective method for reducing computational complexity without requiring architectural modifications or external augmentation.

### Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation in Large Language Models: A Novel   Approach to Contextual Information Flow
**Authors**: Alfred Bexley, Lukas Radcliffe, Giles Weatherstone, Joseph Sakau

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:59:28Z

**Summary**: Context propagation remains a central challenge in language model architectures, particularly in tasks requiring the retention of long-range dependencies. Conventional attention mechanisms, while effective in many applications, exhibit limitations in maintaining coherent contextual representations over extended sequences due to their reliance on discrete token interactions. A novel approach is introduced through the formulation of Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation (ITFP), which models contextual relationships as continuous tensor fields distributed across token embeddings. The propagation dynamics are governed through differential equations that enable a structured flow of contextual information, augmenting the standard attention mechanism to enhance coherence and recall. A series of experiments conducted on an open-source transformer-based model demonstrate that ITFP provides measurable improvements in contextual retention, dependency resolution, and inference stability across various linguistic structures. Comparisons with baseline models reveal a reduction in syntactic inconsistencies and factual errors, while ablation studies indicate that the choice of propagation depth and integration strength significantly impacts model performance. Additional evaluations assessing domain generalization suggest that ITFP effectively adapts across different text genres, reinforcing its applicability beyond conventional language modeling tasks. Although computational trade-offs are introduced through the inclusion of tensor field computations, empirical findings suggest that the benefits in accuracy and coherence outweigh the increased processing demands.

**Authors**: Joseph Sakau, Evander Kozlowski, Roderick Thistledown, Basil Steinberger

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:59:14Z

**Summary**: The organization of latent knowledge within large-scale models poses unique challenges when addressing overlapping representations and optimizing contextual accuracy. Conceptual redundancies embedded across layers often result in inefficiencies that affect both computational demands and task-specific outcomes. A framework was proposed to restructure these redundancies through advanced clustering techniques and dynamic thresholding, ensuring that critical semantic relationships are preserved while removing unnecessary overlaps. Evaluations revealed improved memory efficiency and faster inference times, alongside better alignment in latent knowledge clusters that enhanced interpretability. Improvements in error rates and adversarial robustness suggest that restructuring redundancies has broader implications for increasing model reliability across diverse applications. Comparative analyses highlighted reductions in resource consumption and notable gains in performance, particularly in translation and summarization tasks. Energy metrics demonstrated significant savings during training phases, further validating the practicality of the approach for real-world deployments. Representational fidelity was also enhanced, with latent space evaluations indicating better cluster alignment and higher semantic consistency. The methodology bridges a key gap in model optimization through directly addressing redundancies at the structural level. Its application opens avenues for scalable, efficient, and contextually aware systems that can adapt to complex, domain-specific tasks without compromising on performance.

### Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection for Structural Refinement of   Large Language Model Representations
**Authors**: Alistair Wren, Beatrice Loxley, Hamish Cadwallader, Simon Beckwith, Fabian Pargeter, James Blades

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:58:31Z

**Summary**: Internal representations within deep neural architectures encode high-dimensional abstractions of linguistic structures, yet they often exhibit inefficiencies in feature distribution, limiting expressiveness and adaptability. Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection introduces a structured refinement technique that selectively reconfigures token embeddings through controlled subspace constraints, ensuring more stable and geometrically well-defined feature distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization. Perplexity evaluations confirmed that the adjustments did not negatively impact sequence coherence, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: James Blades, Frederick Somerfield, William Langley, Susan Everingham, Maurice Witherington

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:58:16Z

**Summary**: Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.

### Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion in Large Language Models for   Multi-Contextual Consistency
**Authors**: Irin Kabakum, Thomas Montgomery, Daniel Ravenwood, Genevieve Harrington

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:55:17Z

**Summary**: The Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion (SLED) mechanism redefines the representation of hierarchical semantics within transformer-based architectures, enabling enhanced contextual consistency across a wide array of linguistic tasks. By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications. SLED offers a different perspective on embedding design and its implications for advancing language modeling.

### Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory
**Authors**: Takashi Izumo

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:53:02Z

**Summary**: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.

### RL-finetuning LLMs from on- and off-policy data with a single algorithm
**Authors**: Yunhao Tang, Taco Cohen, David W. Zhang, Michal Valko, Rémi Munos

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:52:38Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm (AGRO, for Any-Generation Reward Optimization) for fine-tuning large-language models. AGRO leverages the concept of generation consistency, which states that the optimal policy satisfies the notion of consistency across any possible generation of the model. We derive algorithms that find optimal solutions via the sample-based policy gradient and provide theoretical guarantees on their convergence. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AGRO in both on-policy and off-policy settings, showing improved performance on the mathematical reasoning dataset over baseline algorithms.

### Does Safety Training of LLMs Generalize to Semantically Related Natural   Prompts?
**Authors**: Sravanti Addepalli, Yerram Varun, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:49:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaks that lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences using safety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.

### Innate Reasoning is Not Enough: In-Context Learning Enhances Reasoning   Large Language Models with Less Overthinking
**Authors**: Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Lizhe Chen, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:37:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs), which employ extended thinking processes with reflection and self-correction capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of test-time scaling. RLLMs exhibit innate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capability obtained from training, leading to a natural question: "Is CoT prompting, a popular In-Context Learning (ICL) method for chat LLMs, necessary to enhance the reasoning capability of RLLMs?" In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impacts of Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT on RLLMs across mathematical reasoning tasks. We examine models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, finding that contrary to concerns, CoT prompting significantly enhances RLLMs' performance in most scenarios. Our results reveal distinct patterns: large-capacity models show minimal improvement on simple tasks but substantial gains on complex problems, while smaller models exhibit the opposite behavior. Further analysis demonstrates that CoT prompting effectively controls the distribution of the numbers of thinking tokens and reasoning steps, reducing excessive reflections by approximately 90% in some cases. Moreover, attention logits analysis reveals the RLLMs' overfitting to reflection-related words, which is mitigated by external CoT guidance. Notably, our experiments indicate that for RLLMs, one-shot CoT consistently yields superior performance compared to Few-shot CoT approaches. Our findings provide important insights for optimizing RLLMs' performance through appropriate prompting strategies.

### RL-RC-DoT: A Block-level RL agent for Task-Aware Video Compression
**Authors**: Uri Gadot, Assaf Shocher, Shie Mannor, Gal Chechik, Assaf Hallak

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:33:41Z

**Summary**: Video encoders optimize compression for human perception by minimizing reconstruction error under bit-rate constraints. In many modern applications such as autonomous driving, an overwhelming majority of videos serve as input for AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation, rather than being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoder for a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However, a major challenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standard video encoders, which are highly efficient and popular. Here, we address this challenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-block level to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us to prioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulate this optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, where the agent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both task performance and bit-rate constraints. Notably, our policy does not require the downstream task as an input during inference, making it suitable for streaming applications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significant improvements in two tasks, car detection, and ROI (saliency) encoding. Our approach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditional task agnostic encoding methods, paving the way for more efficient task-aware video compression.

### HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural   Language
**Authors**: Dimitrios Stamatios Bouras, Yihan Dai, Tairan Wang, Yingfei Xiong, Sergey Mechtaev

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:30:30Z

**Summary**: While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against natural language requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program analysis and verification to natural language artifacts. Drawing inspiration from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various points in the code. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 62% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by increasing the MCC by 93%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 28% boost to MCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.

**Authors**: Giovanni Franco Gabriel Marraffini, Andrés Cotton, Noe Fabian Hsueh, Axel Fridman, Juan Wisznia, Luciano Del Corro

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:29:53Z

**Summary**: The question of how to make decisions that maximise the well-being of all persons is very relevant to design language models that are beneficial to humanity and free from harm. We introduce the Greatest Good Benchmark to evaluate the moral judgments of LLMs using utilitarian dilemmas. Our analysis across 15 diverse LLMs reveals consistently encoded moral preferences that diverge from established moral theories and lay population moral standards. Most LLMs have a marked preference for impartial beneficence and rejection of instrumental harm. These findings showcase the 'artificial moral compass' of LLMs, offering insights into their moral alignment.

### Optimizing Language Models for Inference Time Objectives using   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yunhao Tang, Kunhao Zheng, Gabriel Synnaeve, Rémi Munos

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:21:26Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate the merits of explicitly optimizing for inference time algorithmic performance during model training. We show how optimizing for inference time performance can improve overall model efficacy. We consider generic inference time objectives with $k$ samples, with a focus on pass@$k$ and majority voting as two main applications. With language model training on reasoning datasets, we showcase the performance trade-off enabled by training with such objectives. When training on code generation tasks, we show that the approach significantly improves pass@$k$ objectives compared to the baseline method.

### Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A   Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond
**Authors**: Chongyu Fan, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Anil Ramakrishna, Mingyi Hong, Sijia Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:18:42Z

**Summary**: The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Smooth.

### SACB-Net: Spatial-awareness Convolutions for Medical Image Registration
**Authors**: Xinxing Cheng, Tianyang Zhang, Wenqi Lu, Qingjie Meng, Alejandro F. Frangi, Jinming Duan

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:14:21Z

**Summary**: Deep learning-based image registration methods have shown state-of-the-art performance and rapid inference speeds. Despite these advances, many existing approaches fall short in capturing spatially varying information in non-local regions of feature maps due to the reliance on spatially-shared convolution kernels. This limitation leads to suboptimal estimation of deformation fields. In this paper, we propose a 3D Spatial-Awareness Convolution Block (SACB) to enhance the spatial information within feature representations. Our SACB estimates the spatial clusters within feature maps by leveraging feature similarity and subsequently parameterizes the adaptive convolution kernels across diverse regions. This adaptive mechanism generates the convolution kernels (weights and biases) tailored to spatial variations, thereby enabling the network to effectively capture spatially varying information. Building on SACB, we introduce a pyramid flow estimator (named SACB-Net) that integrates SACBs to facilitate multi-scale flow composition, particularly addressing large deformations. Experimental results on the brain IXI and LPBA datasets as well as Abdomen CT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SACB and the superiority of SACB-Net over the state-of-the-art learning-based registration methods. The code is available at https://github.com/x-xc/SACB_Net .

**Authors**: Steven Abreu, Sumit Bam Shrestha, Rui-Jie Zhu, Jason Eshraghian

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:05:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but require large amounts of energy. In this work, we present a MatMul-free LLM architecture adapted for Intel's neuromorphic processor, Loihi 2. Our approach leverages Loihi 2's support for low-precision, event-driven computation and stateful processing. Our hardware-aware quantized model on GPU demonstrates that a 370M parameter MatMul-free model can be quantized with no accuracy loss. Based on preliminary results, we report up to 3x higher throughput with 2x less energy, compared to transformer-based LLMs on an edge GPU, with significantly better scaling. Further hardware optimizations will increase throughput and decrease energy consumption. These results show the potential of neuromorphic hardware for efficient inference and pave the way for efficient reasoning models capable of generating complex, long-form text rapidly and cost-effectively.

### Context-Efficient Retrieval with Factual Decomposition
**Authors**: Yanhong Li, David Yunis, David McAllester, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:48:22Z

**Summary**: There has recently been considerable interest in incorporating information retrieval into large language models (LLMs). Retrieval from a dynamically expanding external corpus of text allows a model to incorporate current events and can be viewed as a form of episodic memory. Here we demonstrate that pre-processing the external corpus into semi-structured ''atomic facts'' makes retrieval more efficient. More specifically, we demonstrate that our particular form of atomic facts improves performance on various question answering tasks when the amount of retrieved text is limited. Limiting the amount of retrieval reduces the size of the context and improves inference efficiency.

### Motif Counting in Complex Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
**Authors**: Haozhe Yin, Kai Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Yizhang He, Ying Zhang, Xuemin Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:48:05Z

**Summary**: Motif counting plays a crucial role in understanding the structural properties of networks. By computing motif frequencies, researchers can draw key insights into the structural properties of the underlying network. As networks become increasingly complex, different graph models have been proposed, giving rise to diverse motif patterns. These variations introduce unique computational challenges that require specialized algorithms tailored to specific motifs within different graph structures. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of motif counting techniques across general graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and hypergraphs. We categorize existing algorithms according to their underlying computational strategies, emphasizing key similarities and distinctions. In addition to reviewing current methodologies, we examine their strengths, limitations, and computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we explore future directions in motif counting, including scalable implementations to improve efficiency in large-scale networks, algorithmic adaptations for dynamic, temporal, and attributed graphs, and deeper integration with large language models (LLMs) and graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG). By offering a detailed analysis of these approaches, this survey aims to support researchers and practitioners in advancing motif counting for increasingly complex network data.

### New limits on warm inflation from pulsar timing arrays
**Authors**: Rocco D'Agostino, Matteo Califano

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:40:10Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) generated in the post-inflationary universe to infer new limits on warm inflation. We specifically examine the evolution of primordial GWs by scalar perturbations produced during the radiation-dominated epoch. For this purpose, we assume a weak regime of warm inflation under the slow-roll approximation, with a dissipation coefficient linearly dependent on the temperature of the radiation bath. We then derive analytical expressions for the curvature power spectrum and the scalar index, in the cases of chaotic and exponential potentials of the inflationary field. Subsequently, we compare the theoretical predictions regarding the relic energy density of GWs with the stochastic GW background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration through the use of pulsar timing array measurements. In so doing, we obtain numerical constraints on the free parameters of the inflationary models under study. Finally, we conduct a model selection analysis through the Bayesian inference method to measure the statistical performance of the different theoretical scenarios.

### Causal Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Graphs
**Authors**: Jean Durand, Yashas Annadani, Stefan Bauer, Sonali Parbhoo

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:14:37Z

**Summary**: Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) is a methodology designed to optimize an outcome variable by leveraging known causal relationships through targeted interventions. Traditional CBO methods require a fully and accurately specified causal graph, which is a limitation in many real-world scenarios where such graphs are unknown. To address this, we propose a new method for the CBO framework that operates without prior knowledge of the causal graph. Consistent with causal bandit theory, we demonstrate through theoretical analysis and that focusing on the direct causal parents of the target variable is sufficient for optimization, and provide empirical validation in the context of CBO. Furthermore we introduce a new method that learns a Bayesian posterior over the direct parents of the target variable. This allows us to optimize the outcome variable while simultaneously learning the causal structure. Our contributions include a derivation of the closed-form posterior distribution for the linear case. In the nonlinear case where the posterior is not tractable, we present a Gaussian Process (GP) approximation that still enables CBO by inferring the parents of the outcome variable. The proposed method performs competitively with existing benchmarks and scales well to larger graphs, making it a practical tool for real-world applications where causal information is incomplete.

### To FP8 and Back Again: Quantifying Reduced Precision Effects on LLM   Training Stability
**Authors**: Joonhyung Lee, Jeongin Bae, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:11:03Z

**Summary**: The massive computational costs associated with large language model (LLM) pretraining have spurred great interest in reduced-precision floating-point representations to accelerate the process. As a result, the BrainFloat16 (BF16) precision has become the de facto standard for LLM training, with hardware support included in recent generations of accelerators. This trend has gone even further in the latest processors, where FP8 has recently been introduced. However, prior experience with FP16, which was found to be less stable than BF16, raises concerns as to whether FP8, with even fewer bits than FP16, can be a cost-effective option for LLM training. We argue that reduced-precision training schemes must have similar training stability and hyperparameter sensitivities to their higher-precision counterparts in order to be cost-effective. However, we find that currently available methods for FP8 training are not robust enough to allow their use as economical replacements. This prompts us to investigate the stability of reduced-precision LLM training in terms of robustness across random seeds, learning rates, and datasets. To this end, we propose new evaluation techniques and a new metric for quantifying loss landscape sharpness in autoregressive language models. By simulating incremental bit reductions in floating-point representations, we analyze the relationship between representational power and training stability with the intent of aiding future research into the field.

### Scaling Laws of Synthetic Data for Language Models
**Authors**: Zeyu Qin, Qingxiu Dong, Xingxing Zhang, Li Dong, Xiaolong Huang, Ziyi Yang, Mahmoud Khademi, Dongdong Zhang, Hany Hassan Awadalla, Yi R. Fung, Weizhu Chen, Minhao Cheng, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:07:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, largely driven by high-quality web data used in pre-training. However, recent studies indicate this data source is rapidly depleting. Synthetic data emerges as a promising alternative, but it remains unclear whether synthetic datasets exhibit predictable scalability comparable to raw pre-training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by introducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora into diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by automatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple documents using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical experiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that reliably adheres to the \emph{rectified scaling law} across various model sizes; (2) Performance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models approach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B model peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons with existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate that SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability. Our findings highlight synthetic data as a scalable and reliable alternative to organic pre-training corpora, offering a viable path toward continued improvement in model performance.

### LinkAlign: Scalable Schema Linking for Real-World Large-Scale   Multi-Database Text-to-SQL
**Authors**: Yihan Wang, Peiyu Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:04:18Z

**Summary**: Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in achieving human-level performance in Text-to-SQL tasks, particularly in real-world large-scale multi-database scenarios. Addressing schema linking faces two major challenges: (1) Database Retrieval: selecting the correct database from a large schema pool in multi-database settings, while filtering out irrelevant ones. (2) Schema Item Grounding: accurately identifying the relevant tables and columns from within a large and redundant schema for SQL generation. To address this, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework that can effectively adapt existing baselines to real-world environments by systematically addressing schema linking. Our framework comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. We evaluate our method performance of schema linking on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, and the ability to adapt existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world environments on the SPIDER 2.0-lite benchmark. Experiments show that LinkAlign outperforms existing baselines in multi-database settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. On the other hand, our method ranks highest among models excluding those using long chain-of-thought reasoning LLMs. This work bridges the gap between current research and real-world scenarios, providing a practical solution for robust and scalable schema linking. The codes are available at https://github.com/Satissss/LinkAlign.

### Tiling artifacts and trade-offs of feature normalization in the   segmentation of large biological images
**Authors**: Elena Buglakova, Anwai Archit, Edoardo D'Imprima, Julia Mahamid, Constantin Pape, Anna Kreshuk

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:00:37Z

**Summary**: Segmentation of very large images is a common problem in microscopy, medical imaging or remote sensing. The problem is usually addressed by sliding window inference, which can theoretically lead to seamlessly stitched predictions. However, in practice many of the popular pipelines still suffer from tiling artifacts. We investigate the root cause of these issues and show that they stem from the normalization layers within the neural networks. We propose indicators to detect normalization issues and further explore the trade-offs between artifact-free and high-quality predictions, using three diverse microscopy datasets as examples. Finally, we propose to use BatchRenorm as the most suitable normalization strategy, which effectively removes tiling artifacts and enhances transfer performance, thereby improving the reusability of trained networks for new datasets.

### AutoBayes: A Compositional Framework for Generalized Variational   Inference
**Authors**: Toby St Clere Smithe, Marco Perin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:55:49Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new compositional framework for generalized variational inference, clarifying the different parts of a model, how they interact, and how they compose. We explain that both exact Bayesian inference and the loss functions typical of variational inference (such as variational free energy and its generalizations) satisfy chain rules akin to that of reverse-mode automatic differentiation, and we advocate for exploiting this to build and optimize models accordingly. To this end, we construct a series of compositional tools: for building models; for constructing their inversions; for attaching local loss functions; and for exposing parameters. Finally, we explain how the resulting parameterized statistical games may be optimized locally, too. We illustrate our framework with a number of classic examples, pointing to new areas of extensibility that are revealed.

### Variational inference for hierarchical models with conditional scale and   skewness corrections
**Authors**: Lucas Kock, Linda S. L. Tan, Prateek Bansal, David J. Nott

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:55:38Z

**Summary**: Gaussian variational approximations are widely used for summarizing posterior distributions in Bayesian models, especially in high-dimensional settings. However, a drawback of such approximations is the inability to capture skewness or more complex features of the posterior. Recent work suggests applying skewness corrections to existing Gaussian or other symmetric approximations to address this limitation. We propose to incorporate the skewness correction into the definition of an approximating variational family. We consider approximating the posterior for hierarchical models, in which there are ``global'' and ``local'' parameters. A baseline variational approximation is defined as the product of a Gaussian marginal posterior for global parameters and a Gaussian conditional posterior for local parameters given the global ones. Skewness corrections are then considered. The adjustment of the conditional posterior term for local variables is adaptive to the global parameter value. Optimization of baseline variational parameters is performed jointly with the skewness correction. Our approach allows the location, scale and skewness to be captured separately, without using additional parameters for skewness adjustments. The proposed method substantially improves accuracy for only a modest increase in computational cost compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian approximations. Good performance is demonstrated in generalized linear mixed models and multinomial logit discrete choice models.

### StarGen: A Spatiotemporal Autoregression Framework with Video Diffusion   Model for Scalable and Controllable Scene Generation
**Authors**: Shangjin Zhai, Zhichao Ye, Jialin Liu, Weijian Xie, Jiaqi Hu, Zhen Peng, Hua Xue, Danpeng Chen, Xiaomeng Wang, Lei Yang, Nan Wang, Haomin Liu, Guofeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:53:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large reconstruction and generative models have significantly improved scene reconstruction and novel view generation. However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/StarGen.

### Learning to segment anatomy and lesions from disparately labeled sources   in brain MRI
**Authors**: Meva Himmetoglu, Ilja Ciernik, Ender Konukoglu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:52:26Z

**Summary**: Segmenting healthy tissue structures alongside lesions in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) remains a challenge for today's algorithms due to lesion-caused disruption of the anatomy and lack of jointly labeled training datasets, where both healthy tissues and lesions are labeled on the same images. In this paper, we propose a method that is robust to lesion-caused disruptions and can be trained from disparately labeled training sets, i.e., without requiring jointly labeled samples, to automatically segment both. In contrast to prior work, we decouple healthy tissue and lesion segmentation in two paths to leverage multi-sequence acquisitions and merge information with an attention mechanism. During inference, an image-specific adaptation reduces adverse influences of lesion regions on healthy tissue predictions. During training, the adaptation is taken into account through meta-learning and co-training is used to learn from disparately labeled training images. Our model shows an improved performance on several anatomical structures and lesions on a publicly available brain glioblastoma dataset compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

### A Universal Model Combining Differential Equations and Neural Networks   for Ball Trajectory Prediction
**Authors**: Zhiwei Shi, Chengxi Zhu, Fan Yang, Jun Yan, Zheyun Qin, Songquan Shi, Zhumin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:50:57Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a data driven universal ball trajectory prediction method integrated with physics equations. Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.

### The HalluRAG Dataset: Detecting Closed-Domain Hallucinations in RAG   Applications Using an LLM's Internal States
**Authors**: Fabian Ridder, Malte Schilling

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:50:21Z

**Summary**: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) is critical for enhancing their reliability and trustworthiness. Most research focuses on hallucinations as deviations from information seen during training. However, the opaque nature of an LLM's parametric knowledge complicates the understanding of why generated texts appear ungrounded: The LLM might not have picked up the necessary knowledge from large and often inaccessible datasets, or the information might have been changed or contradicted during further training. Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in training, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged after a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting them at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We present HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these hallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on HalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results show that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that answerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate classifiers for these categories improved accuracy. However, HalluRAG showed some limited generalizability, advocating for more diversity in datasets on hallucinations.

### FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Dahyun Jung, Seungyoon Lee, Hyeonseok Moon, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:48:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced interactions between users and models. These advancements concurrently underscore the need for rigorous safety evaluations due to the manifestation of social biases, which can lead to harmful societal impacts. Despite these concerns, existing benchmarks may overlook the intrinsic weaknesses of LLMs, which can generate biased responses even with simple adversarial instructions. To address this critical gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios (FLEX), designed to test whether LLMs can sustain fairness even when exposed to prompts constructed to induce bias. To thoroughly evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we integrate prompts that amplify potential biases into the fairness assessment. Comparative experiments between FLEX and existing benchmarks demonstrate that traditional evaluations may underestimate the inherent risks in models. This highlights the need for more stringent LLM evaluation benchmarks to guarantee safety and fairness.

### Agent-Initiated Interaction in Phone UI Automation
**Authors**: Noam Kahlon, Guy Rom, Anatoly Efros, Filippo Galgani, Omri Berkovitch, Sapir Caduri, William E. Bishop, Oriana Riva, Ido Dagan

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:46:08Z

**Summary**: Phone automation agents aim to autonomously perform a given natural-language user request, such as scheduling appointments or booking a hotel. While much research effort has been devoted to screen understanding and action planning, complex tasks often necessitate user interaction for successful completion. Aligning the agent with the user's expectations is crucial for building trust and enabling personalized experiences. This requires the agent to proactively engage the user when necessary, avoiding actions that violate their preferences while refraining from unnecessary questions where a default action is expected. We argue that such subtle agent-initiated interaction with the user deserves focused research attention.   To promote such research, this paper introduces a task formulation for detecting the need for user interaction and generating appropriate messages. We thoroughly define the task, including aspects like interaction timing and the scope of the agent's autonomy. Using this definition, we derived annotation guidelines and created AndroidInteraction, a diverse dataset for the task, leveraging an existing UI automation dataset. We tested several text-based and multimodal baseline models for the task, finding that it is very challenging for current LLMs. We suggest that our task formulation, dataset, baseline models and analysis will be valuable for future UI automation research, specifically in addressing this crucial yet often overlooked aspect of agent-initiated interaction. This work provides a needed foundation to allow personalized agents to properly engage the user when needed, within the context of phone UI automation.

### DynFocus: Dynamic Cooperative Network Empowers LLMs with Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Yudong Han, Qingpei Guo, Liyuan Pan, Liu Liu, Yu Guan, Ming Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:31:35Z

**Summary**: The challenge in LLM-based video understanding lies in preserving visual and semantic information in long videos while maintaining a memory-affordable token count. However, redundancy and correspondence in videos have hindered the performance potential of existing methods. Through statistical learning on current datasets, we observe that redundancy occurs in both repeated and answer-irrelevant frames, and the corresponding frames vary with different questions. This suggests the possibility of adopting dynamic encoding to balance detailed video information preservation with token budget reduction. To this end, we propose a dynamic cooperative network, DynFocus, for memory-efficient video encoding in this paper. Specifically, i) a Dynamic Event Prototype Estimation (DPE) module to dynamically select meaningful frames for question answering; (ii) a Compact Cooperative Encoding (CCE) module that encodes meaningful frames with detailed visual appearance and the remaining frames with sketchy perception separately. We evaluate our method on five publicly available benchmarks, and experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.

### Discrete treatment of inverse Compton scattering: implications on   parameter estimation in gamma-ray astronomy
**Authors**: Junji Xia, Xingjian Lv, Kun Fang, Siming Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T03:58:42Z

**Summary**: In gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray physics, the continuous approximation of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is widely adopted to model the evolution of electron energy. However, when the initial electron energy approaches $\sim100$ TeV, the discrete nature of ICS becomes prominent, and the energy of evolved electrons should be considered as a broad distribution rather than a deterministic value. By simulating the evolution paths of individual electrons under ICS, we capture this discrete nature and demonstrate that when the electron injection spectrum exhibits a high-energy cutoff, the correct discrete treatment yields a higher cutoff energy in the evolved spectrum compared to the continuous approximation. Applying the discrete ICS treatment to interpret the gamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga pulsar halo measured by HAWC, we find that the inferred cutoff energy of the injection spectrum is correspondingly lower than that derived using the continuous approximation at a $95\%$ confidence level. This suggests that the systematic bias introduced by the approximation has exceeded the measurement precision. We also expect the application of the discrete ICS correction in the PeV regime using the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J1954+2836u as a case study, pointing out that adopting the continuous approximation may considerably overestimate the electron acceleration capability of the source.

### A multi-scale investigation into the diagnostic potential of the   HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio for AGN and starburst activity in nearby galaxies
**Authors**: J. Butterworth, S. Viti, Y. Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T10:28:12Z

**Summary**: (Abridged) The identification of AGN and SB regions in galaxies is crucial for understanding the role of various physical processes in galaxy evolution. Molecular line ratios, such as the HCN/HCO+ ratio, have been proposed as potential tracers of these distinct environments. This paper aims to assess the reliability of the HCN/HCO+ ratio, from J = 1-0 to J = 4-3 transitions, as a diagnostic tool for differentiating AGN and SB activity across a diverse sample of nearby galaxies. We focus on evaluating the effect of spatial resolution on the robustness of these ratios and investigate the underlying physical conditions that drive observed variations. We compile observations of HCN and HCO+ lines across multiple J transitions from various sources, covering different galaxy types, including Seyferts, starbursts, and (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). The observations span spatial scales from cloud-sized regions to kiloparsec scales. We analyse the behaviour of these ratios at varying resolutions and employ non-LTE radiative transfer models to infer the physical conditions that drive the observed ratios. We find that the HCN/HCO+ ratio from higher J transitions can differentiate between AGN and SB activity when observed at high spatial resolution. This distinction occurs around unity. However, at lower resolutions, contamination from multiple emission sources and beam averaging effects destroy these distinctions. Modelling suggests that elevated HCN/HCO+ ratios in AGN-dominated regions are largely driven by an enhancement in HCN abundance relative to HCO+, likely due to high-temperature chemistry or increased excitation. Our study confirms that the HCN/HCO+ ratio, particularly of higher J transitions, can be a reliable tracer of AGN versus SB activity if observations are conducted at sufficiently high spatial resolution.

### Natural Language Generation
**Authors**: Emiel van Miltenburg, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:03:25Z

**Summary**: This article provides a brief overview of the field of Natural Language Generation. The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.

### Single-Step Latent Consistency Model for Remote Sensing Image   Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Xiaohui Sun, Jiangwei Mo, Hanlin Wu, Jie Ma

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:56:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have greatly advanced remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR). However, their iterative sampling processes often result in slow inference speeds, limiting their application in real-time tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the latent consistency model for super-resolution (LCMSR), a novel single-step diffusion approach designed to enhance both efficiency and visual quality in RSISR tasks. Our proposal is structured into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we pretrain a residual autoencoder to encode the differential information between high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) images, transitioning the diffusion process into a latent space to reduce computational costs. The second stage focuses on consistency diffusion learning, which aims to learn the distribution of residual encodings in the latent space, conditioned on LR images. The consistency constraint enforces that predictions at any two timesteps along the reverse diffusion trajectory remain consistent, enabling direct mapping from noise to data. As a result, the proposed LCMSR reduces the iterative steps of traditional diffusion models from 50-1000 or more to just a single step, significantly improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that LCMSR effectively balances efficiency and performance, achieving inference times comparable to non-diffusion models while maintaining high-quality output.

### Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method
**Authors**: Axel Bücher, Torben Staud

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:52:28Z

**Summary**: The block maxima method is a standard approach for analyzing the extremal behavior of a potentially multivariate time series. It has recently been found that the classical approach based on disjoint block maxima may be universally improved by considering sliding block maxima instead. However, the asymptotic variance formula for estimators based on sliding block maxima involves an integral over the covariance of a certain family of multivariate extreme value distributions, which makes its estimation, and inference in general, an intricate problem. As an alternative, one may rely on bootstrap approximations: we show that naive block-bootstrap approaches from time series analysis are inconsistent even in i.i.d.\ situations, and provide a consistent alternative based on resampling circular block maxima. As a by-product, we show consistency of the classical resampling bootstrap for disjoint block maxima, and that estimators based on circular block maxima have the same asymptotic variance as their sliding block maxima counterparts. The finite sample properties are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments, and the methods are demonstrated by a case study of precipitation extremes.

### Lost in Time: A New Temporal Benchmark for VideoLLMs
**Authors**: Daniel Cores, Michael Dorkenwald, Manuel Mucientes, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:46:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance when integrated with vision models even enabling video understanding. However, evaluating video models presents its own unique challenges, for which several benchmarks have been proposed. In this paper, we show that the currently most used video-language benchmarks can be solved without requiring much temporal reasoning. We identified three main issues in existing datasets: (i) static information from single frames is often sufficient to solve the tasks (ii) the text of the questions and candidate answers is overly informative, allowing models to answer correctly without relying on any visual input (iii) world knowledge alone can answer many of the questions, making the benchmarks a test of knowledge replication rather than video reasoning. In addition, we found that open-ended question-answering benchmarks for video understanding suffer from similar issues while the automatic evaluation process with LLMs is unreliable, making it an unsuitable alternative. As a solution, we propose TVBench, a novel open-source video multiple-choice question-answering benchmark, and demonstrate through extensive evaluations that it requires a high level of temporal understanding. Surprisingly, we find that most recent state-of-the-art video-language models perform similarly to random performance on TVBench, with only a few models such as Qwen2-VL, and Tarsier clearly surpassing this baseline.

### RoboMatrix: A Skill-centric Hierarchical Framework for Scalable Robot   Task Planning and Execution in Open-World
**Authors**: Weixin Mao, Weiheng Zhong, Zhou Jiang, Dong Fang, Zhongyue Zhang, Zihan Lan, Haosheng Li, Fan Jia, Tiancai Wang, Haoqiang Fan, Osamu Yoshie

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:43:25Z

**Summary**: Existing robot policies predominantly adopt the task-centric approach, requiring end-to-end task data collection. This results in limited generalization to new tasks and difficulties in pinpointing errors within long-horizon, multi-stage tasks. To address this, we propose RoboMatrix, a skill-centric hierarchical framework designed for scalable robot task planning and execution in open-world environments. RoboMatrix extracts general meta-skills from diverse complex tasks, enabling the completion of unseen tasks through skill composition. Its architecture consists of a high-level scheduling layer that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for task decomposition, an intermediate skill layer housing meta-skill models, and a low-level hardware layer for robot control. A key innovation of our work is the introduction of the first unified vision-language-action (VLA) model capable of seamlessly integrating both movement and manipulation within one model. This is achieved by combining vision and language prompts to generate discrete actions. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMatrix achieves a 50% higher success rate than task-centric baselines when applied to unseen objects, scenes, and tasks. To advance open-world robotics research, we will open-source code, hardware designs, model weights, and datasets at https://github.com/WayneMao/RoboMatrix.

### T-MAC: CPU Renaissance via Table Lookup for Low-Bit LLM Deployment on   Edge
**Authors**: Jianyu Wei, Shijie Cao, Ting Cao, Lingxiao Ma, Lei Wang, Yanyong Zhang, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:27:16Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important to enhance on-device intelligence. Weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory footprint of LLMs on devices. However, low-bit LLMs necessitate mixed precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) of low precision weights and high precision activations during inference. Existing systems, lacking native support for mpGEMM, resort to dequantize weights for high precision computation. Such an indirect way can lead to a significant inference overhead.   In this paper, we introduce T-MAC, an innovative lookup table(LUT)-based method designed for efficient low-bit LLM (i.e., weight-quantized LLM) inference on CPUs. T-MAC directly supports mpGEMM without dequantization, while simultaneously eliminating multiplications and reducing additions required. Specifically, T-MAC transforms the traditional data-type-centric multiplication to bit-wise table lookup, and enables a unified and scalable mpGEMM solution.   Our LUT-based kernels scale linearly to the weight bit-width. Evaluated on low-bit Llama and BitNet models, T-MAC demonstrates up to 4x increase in throughput and 70% reduction in energy consumption compared to llama.cpp. For BitNet-b1.58-3B, T-MAC delivers a token generation throughput of 30 tokens/s with a single core and 71 tokens/s with eight cores on M2-Ultra, and 11 tokens/s on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi 5, which significantly exceeds the adult average reading speed. T-MAC with LUT-based computing paradigm, paves the way for the practical deployment of low-bit LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising computational efficiency. The system is open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/T-MAC .

### Learning Causal Transition Matrix for Instance-dependent Label Noise
**Authors**: Jiahui Li, Tai-Wei Chang, Kun Kuang, Ximing Li, Long Chen, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:23:55Z

**Summary**: Noisy labels are both inevitable and problematic in machine learning methods, as they negatively impact models' generalization ability by causing overfitting. In the context of learning with noise, the transition matrix plays a crucial role in the design of statistically consistent algorithms. However, the transition matrix is often considered unidentifiable. One strand of methods typically addresses this problem by assuming that the transition matrix is instance-independent; that is, the probability of mislabeling a particular instance is not influenced by its characteristics or attributes. This assumption is clearly invalid in complex real-world scenarios. To better understand the transition relationship and relax this assumption, we propose to study the data generation process of noisy labels from a causal perspective. We discover that an unobservable latent variable can affect either the instance itself, the label annotation procedure, or both, which complicates the identification of the transition matrix. To address various scenarios, we have unified these observations within a new causal graph. In this graph, the input instance is divided into a noise-resistant component and a noise-sensitive component based on whether they are affected by the latent variable. These two components contribute to identifying the ``causal transition matrix'', which approximates the true transition matrix with theoretical guarantee. In line with this, we have designed a novel training framework that explicitly models this causal relationship and, as a result, achieves a more accurate model for inferring the clean label.

### KSHSeek: Data-Driven Approaches to Mitigating and Detecting   Knowledge-Shortcut Hallucinations in Generative Models
**Authors**: Zhiwei Wang, Zhongxin Liu, Ying Li, Hongyu Sun, Meng Xu, Yuqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:18:27Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the development of natural language processing (NLP), especially in text generation tasks like question answering. However, model hallucinations remain a major challenge in natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their complex causes. We systematically expand on the causes of factual hallucinations from the perspective of knowledge shortcuts, analyzing hallucinations arising from correct and defect-free data and demonstrating that knowledge-shortcut hallucinations are prevalent in generative models. To mitigate this issue, we propose a high similarity pruning algorithm at the data preprocessing level to reduce spurious correlations in the data. Additionally, we design a specific detection method for knowledge-shortcut hallucinations to evaluate the effectiveness of our mitigation strategy. Experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces knowledge-shortcut hallucinations, particularly in fine-tuning tasks, without negatively impacting model performance in question answering. This work introduces a new paradigm for mitigating specific hallucination issues in generative models, enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world applications.

### KL-geodesics flow matching with a novel sampling scheme
**Authors**: Egor Sevriugov, Ivan Oseledets

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:09:07Z

**Summary**: Non-autoregressive language models generate all tokens simultaneously, offering potential speed advantages over traditional autoregressive models, but they face challenges in modeling the complex dependencies inherent in text data. In this work, we investigate a conditional flow matching approach for text generation. We represent tokens as one-hot vectors in a \(V\)-dimensional simplex and utilize geodesics under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which correspond to linear interpolation in logit space. We provide a theoretical justification that maximizing the conditional likelihood \(P_{\theta}(x_1 \mid x_t, t)\) yields the exact flow matching velocity under logit interpolation. To address the suboptimal performance of basic inference, we propose a novel empirical sampling scheme that iteratively samples from the conditional distribution and introduces additional noise, significantly improving results despite lacking full theoretical underpinnings. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid inference method that combines the basic approach with the sampling scheme. This method demonstrates superior performance on both conditional and unconditional text generation experiments compared to previous SOTA method for discrete flow matching.

### RelationField: Relate Anything in Radiance Fields
**Authors**: Sebastian Koch, Johanna Wald, Mirco Colosi, Narunas Vaskevicius, Pedro Hermosilla, Federico Tombari, Timo Ropinski

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:06:08Z

**Summary**: Neural radiance fields are an emerging 3D scene representation and recently even been extended to learn features for scene understanding by distilling open-vocabulary features from vision-language models. However, current method primarily focus on object-centric representations, supporting object segmentation or detection, while understanding semantic relationships between objects remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose RelationField, the first method to extract inter-object relationships directly from neural radiance fields. RelationField represents relationships between objects as pairs of rays within a neural radiance field, effectively extending its formulation to include implicit relationship queries. To teach RelationField complex, open-vocabulary relationships, relationship knowledge is distilled from multi-modal LLMs. To evaluate RelationField, we solve open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation tasks and relationship-guided instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. See the project website at https://relationfield.github.io.

### ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement   Learning

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:00:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.

### Noisier2Inverse: Self-Supervised Learning for Image Reconstruction with   Correlated Noise
**Authors**: Nadja Gruber, Johannes Schwab, Markus Haltmeier, Ander Biguri, Clemens Dlaska, Gyeongha Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:59:11Z

**Summary**: We propose Noisier2Inverse, a correction-free self-supervised deep learning approach for general inverse prob- lems. The proposed method learns a reconstruction function without the need for ground truth samples and is ap- plicable in cases where measurement noise is statistically correlated. This includes computed tomography, where detector imperfections or photon scattering create correlated noise patterns, as well as microscopy and seismic imaging, where physical interactions during measurement introduce dependencies in the noise structure. Similar to Noisier2Noise, a key step in our approach is the generation of noisier data from which the reconstruction net- work learns. However, unlike Noisier2Noise, the proposed loss function operates in measurement space and is trained to recover an extrapolated image instead of the original noisy one. This eliminates the need for an extrap- olation step during inference, which would otherwise suffer from ill-posedness. We numerically demonstrate that our method clearly outperforms previous self-supervised approaches that account for correlated noise.

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:58:39Z

**Summary**: Equilibrium reconstruction, which infers internal magnetic fields, plasmas current, and pressure distributions in tokamaks using diagnostic and coil current data, is crucial for controlled magnetic confinement nuclear fusion research. However, traditional numerical methods often fall short of real-time control needs due to time-consuming computations or iteration convergence issues. This paper introduces EFIT-mini, a novel algorithm blending machine learning with numerical simulation. It employs a multi-task neural network to replace complex steps in numerical equilibrium inversion, such as magnetic surface boundary identification, combining the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their individual drawbacks. The neural network processes coil currents and magnetic measurements to directly output plasmas parameters, including polynomial coefficients for $p'$ and $ff'$, providing high-precision initial values for subsequent Picard iterations. Compared to existing AI-driven methods, EFIT-mini incorporates more physical priors (e.g., least squares constraints) to enhance inversion accuracy. Validated on EXL-50U tokamak discharge data, EFIT-mini achieves over 98% overlap in the last closed flux surface area with traditional methods. Besides, EFIT-mini's neural network and full algorithm compute single time slices in just 0.11ms and 0.36ms at 129$\times$129 resolution, respectively, representing a three-order-of-magnitude speedup. This innovative approach leverages machine learning's speed and numerical algorithms' explainability, offering a robust solution for real-time plasmas shape control and potential extension to kinetic equilibrium reconstruction. Its efficiency and versatility position EFIT-mini as a promising tool for tokamak real-time monitoring and control, as well as for providing key inputs to other real-time inversion algorithms.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval
**Authors**: Chuong Huynh, Jinyu Yang, Ashish Tawari, Mubarak Shah, Son Tran, Raffay Hamid, Trishul Chilimbi, Abhinav Shrivastava

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.

### Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution
**Authors**: Baifeng Shi, Boyi Li, Han Cai, Yao Lu, Sifei Liu, Marco Pavone, Jan Kautz, Song Han, Trevor Darrell, Pavlo Molchanov, Hongxu Yin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:58:37Z

**Summary**: High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.

### A proposal for an incident regime that tracks and counters threats to   national security posed by AI systems
**Authors**: Alejandro Ortega

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:51:50Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our proposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national security threats posed by AI systems.

### Right for Right Reasons: Large Language Models for Verifiable   Commonsense Knowledge Graph Question Answering
**Authors**: Armin Toroghi, Willis Guo, Mohammad Mahdi Abdollah Pour, Scott Sanner

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:44:19Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods seek to answer Natural Language questions using the relational information stored in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., "In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.

### CausalRAG: Integrating Causal Graphs into Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Nengbo Wang, Xiaotian Han, Jagdip Singh, Jing Ma, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:43:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances LLM capabilities by integrating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems face critical limitations, including disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking, and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval. To address these issues, we propose CausalRAG, a novel framework that incorporates causal graphs into the retrieval process. By constructing and tracing causal relationships, CausalRAG preserves contextual continuity and improves retrieval precision, leading to more accurate and interpretable responses. We evaluate CausalRAG against regular RAG and graph-based RAG approaches, demonstrating its superiority across several metrics. Our findings suggest that grounding retrieval in causal reasoning provides a promising approach to knowledge-intensive tasks.

### Think Twice: Enhancing LLM Reasoning by Scaling Multi-round Test-time   Thinking
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Tian, Sitong Zhao, Haotian Wang, Shuaiting Chen, Yunjie Ji, Yiping Peng, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:19:38Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques. The key prompt: {Original question prompt} The assistant's previous answer is: <answer> {last round answer} </answer>, and please re-answer.

### FALCONEye: Finding Answers and Localizing Content in ONE-hour-long   videos with multi-modal LLMs
**Authors**: Carlos Plou, Cesar Borja, Ruben Martinez-Cantin, Ana C. Murillo

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:17:19Z

**Summary**: Information retrieval in hour-long videos presents a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly when the desired information is localized within a small subset of frames. Long video data presents challenges for VLMs due to context window limitations and the difficulty of pinpointing frames containing the answer. Our novel video agent, FALCONEye, combines a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM) to search relevant information along the video, and locate the frames with the answer. FALCONEye novelty relies on 1) the proposed meta-architecture, which is better suited to tackle hour-long videos compared to short video approaches in the state-of-the-art; 2) a new efficient exploration algorithm to locate the information using short clips, captions and answer confidence; and 3) our state-of-the-art VLMs calibration analysis for the answer confidence. Our agent is built over a small-size VLM and a medium-size LLM being accessible to run on standard computational resources. We also release FALCON-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate long (average > 1 hour) Video Answer Search challenges, highlighting the need for open-ended question evaluation. Our experiments show FALCONEye's superior performance than the state-of-the-art in FALCON-Bench, and similar or better performance in related benchmarks.

### A Comparative Analysis of Word Segmentation, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and   Named Entity Recognition for Historical Chinese Sources, 1900-1950
**Authors**: Zhao Fang, Liang-Chun Wu, Xuening Kong, Spencer Dean Stewart

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:07:21Z

**Summary**: This paper compares large language models (LLMs) and traditional natural language processing (NLP) tools for performing word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) on Chinese texts from 1900 to 1950. Historical Chinese documents pose challenges for text analysis due to their logographic script, the absence of natural word boundaries, and significant linguistic changes. Using a sample dataset from the Shanghai Library Republican Journal corpus, traditional tools such as Jieba and spaCy are compared to LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and the GLM series. The results show that LLMs outperform traditional methods in all metrics, albeit at considerably higher computational costs, highlighting a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, LLMs better handle genre-specific challenges such as poetry and temporal variations (i.e., pre-1920 versus post-1920 texts), demonstrating that their contextual learning capabilities can advance NLP approaches to historical texts by reducing the need for domain-specific training data.

### FireEdit: Fine-grained Instruction-based Image Editing via Region-aware   Vision Language Model
**Authors**: Jun Zhou, Jiahao Li, Zunnan Xu, Hanhui Li, Yiji Cheng, Fa-Ting Hong, Qin Lin, Qinglin Lu, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:59:42Z

**Summary**: Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant progress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods. Our project is available at https://zjgans.github.io/fireedit.github.io.

### Compact and stable source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs based   on a folded linear displacement interferometer
**Authors**: Sarah. E. McCarthy, Ali Anwar, Daniel K. L. Oi, Loyd J. McKnight

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:59:38Z

**Summary**: The realization of quantum networks requires the development of robust low size, weight and power (SWaP) systems suitable for operation under harsh environments in remote and mobile nodes such as satellites. We present a source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs in a folded linear displacement interferometer based on spontaneous parametric down conversion using a Type-0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. Featuring a compact and stable double-pass geometry using a corner-cube retroreflector, the source has a detected pair rate of 2.5 M pairs/s/mW with a Bell state fidelity of 94.1% +/- 2.1%. The quality and demonstrated performance of the source are suitable for deployment in entanglement-based quantum networks.

### Nordic perspective on System Integrity Protection Schemes in relation to   capacity allocation
**Authors**: Gabriel Malmer, Arvid Rolander, Emil Hillberg, Olof Samuelsson, Susanne Ackeby, Lars Nordström

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:42:04Z

**Summary**: The urgent need to address climate change prompts societies worldwide to adopt carbon neutral energy and electrification. To facilitate this, a range of technologies and policies will be needed. Alternatives to traditional power grid reinforcement, such as grid-enhancing technologies and system automation, are particularly attractive due to their potentially low cost and fast deployment time. One alternative is System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) - automatic and curative remedial actions (RAs) which can boost grid transfer capacities without compromising with reliability since they can act faster than manual control. The use of SIPS however is scattered, with limited coordination between countries, and the full potential of using SIPS for capacity enhancement is not yet realized. The aim of this paper is to provide a case study and comparison of SIPS in the Nordic countries, particularly in relation to capacity allocation. It also seeks to harmonize terminology relating to ancillary services, RAs, and SIPS. Finally, it examines and compares the inclusion of RAs and SIPS in different Capacity Calculation Methodologies (CCMs). In both main EU CCMs - Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) and Flow-Based (FB) - RAs play a pronounced role. The paper is based on a survey and interviews with Nordic stakeholders, along with a literature review and analysis of public data. The results indicate a large variation in SIPS use across the Nordics. Regarding terminology, we suggest that SIPS is a subcategory of RAs which overlaps with ancillary services. Concerning CCMs, NTC is unable to fully represent capacity constraints in meshed AC systems, which in turn hinders systematic capacity enhancement using RAs. FB on the other hand explicitly includes RAs in the capacity domain. A lower bound for the economic value of RAs can be calculated, amounting to 11.5 million EUR in the Nordics in Nov and Dec 2024.

### LLM4DV: Using Large Language Models for Hardware Test Stimuli Generation
**Authors**: Zixi Zhang, Balint Szekely, Pedro Gimenes, Greg Chadwick, Hugo McNally, Jianyi Cheng, Robert Mullins, Yiren Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:32:46Z

**Summary**: Hardware design verification (DV) is a process that checks the functional equivalence of a hardware design against its specifications, improving hardware reliability and robustness. A key task in the DV process is the test stimuli generation, which creates a set of conditions or inputs for testing. These test conditions are often complex and specific to the given hardware design, requiring substantial human engineering effort to optimize. We seek a solution of automated and efficient testing for arbitrary hardware designs that takes advantage of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have already shown promising results for improving hardware design automation, but remain under-explored for hardware DV. In this paper, we propose an open-source benchmarking framework named LLM4DV that efficiently orchestrates LLMs for automated hardware test stimuli generation. Our analysis evaluates six different LLMs involving six prompting improvements over eight hardware designs and provides insight for future work on LLMs development for efficient automated DV.

### Bitstream Collisions in Neural Image Compression via Adversarial   Perturbations
**Authors**: Jordan Madden, Lhamo Dorje, Xiaohua Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:29:17Z

**Summary**: Neural image compression (NIC) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical compression techniques, offering improved compression ratios. Despite its progress towards standardization and practical deployment, there has been minimal exploration into it's robustness and security. This study reveals an unexpected vulnerability in NIC - bitstream collisions - where semantically different images produce identical compressed bitstreams. Utilizing a novel whitebox adversarial attack algorithm, this paper demonstrates that adding carefully crafted perturbations to semantically different images can cause their compressed bitstreams to collide exactly. The collision vulnerability poses a threat to the practical usability of NIC, particularly in security-critical applications. The cause of the collision is analyzed, and a simple yet effective mitigation method is presented.

### FREE-Merging: Fourier Transform for Efficient Model Merging
**Authors**: Shenghe Zheng, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:19:52Z

**Summary**: With the rapid growth of deep learning, there is an increasing availability of open-source models for various tasks. However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs.

### PAVE: Patching and Adapting Video Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhuoming Liu, Yiquan Li, Khoi Duc Nguyen, Yiwu Zhong, Yin Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:02:37Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained video large language models (Video LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet adapting these models to new tasks involving additional modalities or data types (e.g., audio or 3D information) remains challenging. In this paper, we present PAVE, a flexible framework for adapting pre-trained Video LLMs to downstream tasks with side-channel signals, such as audio, 3D cues, or multi-view videos. PAVE introduces lightweight adapters, referred to as "patches," which add a small number of parameters and operations to a base model without modifying its architecture or pre-trained weights. In doing so, PAVE can effectively adapt the pre-trained base model to support diverse downstream tasks, including audio-visual question answering, 3D reasoning, multi-view video recognition, and high frame rate video understanding. Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance of the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while incurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters. Further, PAVE supports multi-task learning and generalizes well across different Video LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/dragonlzm/PAVE.

### MetaSel: A Test Selection Approach for Fine-tuned DNN Models
**Authors**: Amin Abbasishahkoo, Mahboubeh Dadkhah, Lionel Briand, Dayi Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:00:07Z

**Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face challenges during deployment due to data distribution shifts. Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to new contexts requiring smaller labeled sets. However, testing fine-tuned models under constrained labeling budgets remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MetaSel, a new approach, tailored for fine-tuned DNN models, to select tests from unlabeled inputs. MetaSel assumes that fine-tuned and pre-trained models share related data distributions and exhibit similar behaviors for many inputs. However, their behaviors diverge within the input subspace where fine-tuning alters decision boundaries, making those inputs more prone to misclassification. Unlike general approaches that rely solely on the DNN model and its input set, MetaSel leverages information from both the fine-tuned and pre-trained models and their behavioral differences to estimate misclassification probability for unlabeled test inputs, enabling more effective test selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation, comparing MetaSel against 10 state-of-the-art approaches and involving 68 fine-tuned models across weak, medium, and strong distribution shifts, demonstrates that MetaSel consistently delivers significant improvements in Test Relative Coverage (TRC) over existing baselines, particularly under highly constrained labeling budgets. MetaSel shows average TRC improvements of 28.46% to 56.18% over the most frequent second-best baselines while maintaining a high TRC median and low variability. Our results confirm MetaSel's practicality, robustness, and cost-effectiveness for test selection in the context of fine-tuned models.

### Decorum: A Language-Based Approach For Style-Conditioned Synthesis of   Indoor 3D Scenes
**Authors**: Kelly O. Marshall, Omid Poursaeed, Sergiu Oprea, Amit Kumar, Anushrut Jignasu, Chinmay Hegde, Yilei Li, Rakesh Ranjan

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:58:36Z

**Summary**: 3D indoor scene generation is an important problem for the design of digital and real-world environments. To automate this process, a scene generation model should be able to not only generate plausible scene layouts, but also take into consideration visual features and style preferences. Existing methods for this task exhibit very limited control over these attributes, only allowing text inputs in the form of simple object-level descriptions or pairwise spatial relationships. Our proposed method Decorum enables users to control the scene generation process with natural language by adopting language-based representations at each stage. This enables us to harness recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to model language-to-language mappings. In addition, we show that using a text-based representation allows us to select furniture for our scenes using a novel object retrieval method based on multimodal LLMs. Evaluations on the benchmark 3D-FRONT dataset show that our methods achieve improvements over existing work in text-conditioned scene synthesis and object retrieval.

**Authors**: Yonglin Tian, Fei Lin, Yiduo Li, Tengchao Zhang, Qiyao Zhang, Xuan Fu, Jun Huang, Xingyuan Dai, Yutong Wang, Chunwei Tian, Bai Li, Yisheng Lv, Levente Kovács, Fei-Yue Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:55:33Z

**Summary**: Low-altitude mobility, exemplified by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has introduced transformative advancements across various domains, like transportation, logistics, and agriculture. Leveraging flexible perspectives and rapid maneuverability, UAVs extend traditional systems' perception and action capabilities, garnering widespread attention from academia and industry. However, current UAV operations primarily depend on human control, with only limited autonomy in simple scenarios, and lack the intelligence and adaptability needed for more complex environments and tasks. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable problem-solving and generalization capabilities, offering a promising pathway for advancing UAV intelligence. This paper explores the integration of LLMs and UAVs, beginning with an overview of UAV systems' fundamental components and functionalities, followed by an overview of the state-of-the-art in LLM technology. Subsequently, it systematically highlights the multimodal data resources available for UAVs, which provide critical support for training and evaluation. Furthermore, it categorizes and analyzes key tasks and application scenarios where UAVs and LLMs converge. Finally, a reference roadmap towards agentic UAVs is proposed, aiming to enable UAVs to achieve agentic intelligence through autonomous perception, memory, reasoning, and tool utilization.

### PyGraph: Robust Compiler Support for CUDA Graphs in PyTorch
**Authors**: Abhishek Ghosh, Ajay Nayak, Ashish Panwar, Arkaprava Basu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:47:54Z

**Summary**: CUDA Graphs -- a recent hardware feature introduced for NVIDIA GPUs -- aim to reduce CPU launch overhead by capturing and launching a series of GPU tasks (kernels) as a DAG. However, deploying CUDA Graphs faces several challenges today due to the static structure of a graph. It also incurs performance overhead due to data copy. In fact, we show a counter-intuitive result -- deploying CUDA Graphs hurts performance in many cases.   We introduce PyGraph, a novel approach to automatically harness the power of CUDA Graphs within PyTorch2. Driven by three key observations, PyGraph embodies three novel optimizations: it enables wider deployment of CUDA Graphs, reduces GPU kernel parameter copy overheads, and selectively deploys CUDA Graphs based on a cost-benefit analysis. PyGraph seamlessly integrates with PyTorch2's compilation toolchain, enabling efficient use of CUDA Graphs without manual modifications to the code. We evaluate PyGraph across various machine learning benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over PyTorch2.

### Empowering LLMs to Understand and Generate Complex Vector Graphics
**Authors**: Ximing Xing, Juncheng Hu, Guotao Liang, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu, Qian Yu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:35:29Z

**Summary**: The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly impacted natural language processing but have yet to fully embrace the realm of scalable vector graphics (SVG) generation. While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training, recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions. Additionally, LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths, which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives. In this paper, we present LLM4SVG, an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics. LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens, which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs. Using a series of learnable semantic tokens, a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models, integrating semantic tags, vector instruction encoders, fine-tuned commands, and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric, appearance, and language information. To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected our SVGX-SFT Dataset, consisting of high-quality human-designed SVGs and 580k SVG instruction following data specifically crafted for LLM training, which facilitated the adoption of the supervised fine-tuning strategy popular in LLM development.

### ORION: A Holistic End-to-End Autonomous Driving Framework by   Vision-Language Instructed Action Generation
**Authors**: Haoyu Fu, Diankun Zhang, Zongchuang Zhao, Jianfeng Cui, Dingkang Liang, Chong Zhang, Dingyuan Zhang, Hongwei Xie, Bing Wang, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:18:43Z

**Summary**: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving methods still struggle to make correct decisions in interactive closed-loop evaluation due to limited causal reasoning capability. Current methods attempt to leverage the powerful understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to resolve this dilemma. However, the problem is still open that few VLMs for E2E methods perform well in the closed-loop evaluation due to the gap between the semantic reasoning space and the purely numerical trajectory output in the action space. To tackle this issue, we propose ORION, a holistic E2E autonomous driving framework by vision-language instructed action generation. ORION uniquely combines a QT-Former to aggregate long-term history context, a Large Language Model (LLM) for driving scenario reasoning, and a generative planner for precision trajectory prediction. ORION further aligns the reasoning space and the action space to implement a unified E2E optimization for both visual question-answering (VQA) and planning tasks. Our method achieves an impressive closed-loop performance of 77.74 Driving Score (DS) and 54.62% Success Rate (SR) on the challenge Bench2Drive datasets, which outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin of 14.28 DS and 19.61% SR.

**Authors**: Lewis Newsham, Ryan Hyland, Daniel Prince

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:16:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents SANDMAN, an architecture for cyber deception that leverages Language Agents to emulate convincing human simulacra. Our 'Deceptive Agents' serve as advanced cyber decoys, designed for high-fidelity engagement with attackers by extending the observation period of attack behaviours. Through experimentation, measurement, and analysis, we demonstrate how a prompt schema based on the five-factor model of personality systematically induces distinct 'personalities' in Large Language Models. Our results highlight the feasibility of persona-driven Language Agents for generating diverse, realistic behaviours, ultimately improving cyber deception strategies.

### Doc2OracLL: Investigating the Impact of Documentation on LLM-based Test   Oracle Generation
**Authors**: Soneya Binta Hossain, Raygan Taylor, Matthew Dwyer

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:10:24Z

**Summary**: Code documentation is a critical aspect of software development, serving as a bridge between human understanding and machine-readable code. Beyond assisting developers in understanding and maintaining code, documentation also plays a critical role in automating various software engineering tasks, such as test oracle generation (TOG). In Java, Javadoc comments provide structured, natural language documentation embedded directly in the source code, typically detailing functionality, usage, parameters, return values, and exceptions. While prior research has utilized Javadoc comments in test oracle generation (TOG), there has not been a thorough investigation into their impact when combined with other contextual information, nor into identifying the most relevant components for generating correct and strong test oracles, or understanding their role in detecting real bugs. In this study, we dive deep into investigating the impact of Javadoc comments on TOG.

### Optimizing Photonic Structures with Large Language Model Driven   Algorithm Discovery
**Authors**: Haoran Yin, Anna V. Kononova, Thomas Bäck, Niki van Stein

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:05:25Z

**Summary**: We study how large language models can be used in combination with evolutionary computation techniques to automatically discover optimization algorithms for the design of photonic structures. Building on the Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, we introduce structured prompt engineering tailored to multilayer photonic problems such as Bragg mirror, ellipsometry inverse analysis, and solar cell antireflection coatings. We systematically explore multiple evolutionary strategies, including (1+1), (1+5), (2+10), and others, to balance exploration and exploitation. Our experiments show that LLM-generated algorithms, generated using small-scale problem instances, can match or surpass established methods like quasi-oppositional differential evolution on large-scale realistic real-world problem instances. Notably, LLaMEA's self-debugging mutation loop, augmented by automatically extracted problem-specific insights, achieves strong anytime performance and reliable convergence across diverse problem scales. This work demonstrates the feasibility of domain-focused LLM prompts and evolutionary approaches in solving optical design tasks, paving the way for rapid, automated photonic inverse design.

### FUSE: Label-Free Image-Event Joint Monocular Depth Estimation via   Frequency-Decoupled Alignment and Degradation-Robust Fusion
**Authors**: Pihai Sun, Junjun Jiang, Yuanqi Yao, Youyu Chen, Wenbo Zhao, Kui Jiang, Xianming Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T06:54:19Z

**Summary**: Image-event joint depth estimation methods leverage complementary modalities for robust perception, yet face challenges in generalizability stemming from two factors: 1) limited annotated image-event-depth datasets causing insufficient cross-modal supervision, and 2) inherent frequency mismatches between static images and dynamic event streams with distinct spatiotemporal patterns, leading to ineffective feature fusion. To address this dual challenge, we propose Frequency-decoupled Unified Self-supervised Encoder (FUSE) with two synergistic components: The Parameter-efficient Self-supervised Transfer (PST) establishes cross-modal knowledge transfer through latent space alignment with image foundation models, effectively mitigating data scarcity by enabling joint encoding without depth ground truth. Complementing this, we propose the Frequency-Decoupled Fusion module (FreDFuse) to explicitly decouple high-frequency edge features from low-frequency structural components, resolving modality-specific frequency mismatches through physics-aware fusion. This combined approach enables FUSE to construct a universal image-event encoder that only requires lightweight decoder adaptation for target datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 14% and 24.9% improvements in Abs.Rel on MVSEC and DENSE datasets. The framework exhibits remarkable zero-shot adaptability to challenging scenarios including extreme lighting and motion blur, significantly advancing real-world deployment capabilities.

### MIRROR: A Novel Approach for the Automated Evaluation of Open-Ended   Question Generation
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity, Sudeshna Sarkar

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T15:02:17Z

**Summary**: Automatic question generation is a critical task that involves evaluating question quality by considering factors such as engagement, pedagogical value, and the ability to stimulate critical thinking. These aspects require human-like understanding and judgment, which automated systems currently lack. However, human evaluations are costly and impractical for large-scale samples of generated questions. Therefore, we propose a novel system, MIRROR (Multi-LLM Iterative Review and Response for Optimized Rating), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the evaluation process for questions generated by automated question generation systems. We experimented with several state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama2-70b. We observed that the scores of human evaluation metrics, namely relevance, appropriateness, novelty, complexity, and grammaticality, improved when using the feedback-based approach called MIRROR, tending to be closer to the human baseline scores. Furthermore, we observed that Pearson's correlation coefficient between GPT-4 and human experts improved when using our proposed feedback-based approach, MIRROR, compared to direct prompting for evaluation. Error analysis shows that our proposed approach, MIRROR, significantly helps to improve relevance and appropriateness.

### DeltaZip: Efficient Serving of Multiple Full-Model-Tuned LLMs
**Authors**: Xiaozhe Yao, Qinghao Hu, Ana Klimovic

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:48:01Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) greatly improves model quality for downstream tasks. However, serving many fine-tuned LLMs concurrently is challenging due to the sporadic, bursty, and varying request patterns of different LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present DeltaZip, an LLM serving system that efficiently serves multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models concurrently by aggressively compressing model deltas by up to 10x while maintaining high model quality. The key insight behind this design is that fine-tuning results in small-magnitude changes to the pre-trained model. By co-designing the serving system with the compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves 2x to 12x improvement in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art systems.

### Enhancing Persona Consistency for LLMs' Role-Playing using Persona-Aware   Contrastive Learning
**Authors**: Ke Ji, Yixin Lian, Linxu Li, Jingsheng Gao, Weiyuan Li, Bin Dai

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:43:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough progress in many dialogue generation tasks. However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.

### Writing as a testbed for open ended agents
**Authors**: Sian Gooding, Lucia Lopez-Rivilla, Edward Grefenstette

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:38:36Z

**Summary**: Open-ended tasks are particularly challenging for LLMs due to the vast solution space, demanding both expansive exploration and adaptable strategies, especially when success lacks a clear, objective definition. Writing, with its vast solution space and subjective evaluation criteria, provides a compelling testbed for studying such problems. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs to act as collaborative co-writers, capable of suggesting and implementing text improvements autonomously. We analyse three prominent LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4o - focusing on how their action diversity, human alignment, and iterative improvement capabilities impact overall performance. This work establishes a framework for benchmarking autonomous writing agents and, more broadly, highlights fundamental challenges and potential solutions for building systems capable of excelling in diverse open-ended domains.

**Authors**: Junlan Chen, Kexin Zhang, Daifeng Li, Yangyang Feng, Yuxuan Zhang, Bowen Deng

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:21:15Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models offers new possibilities for structured exploration of scientific knowledge. Rather than viewing scientific discovery as isolated ideas or content, we propose a structured approach that emphasizes the role of method combinations in shaping disruptive insights. Specifically, we investigate how knowledge unit--especially those tied to methodological design--can be modeled and recombined to yield research breakthroughs. Our proposed framework addresses two key challenges. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based mechanism to identify distinguishing features of historically disruptive method combinations within problem-driven contexts. Second, we propose a reasoning-guided Monte Carlo search algorithm that leverages the chain-of-thought capability of LLMs to identify promising knowledge recombinations for new problem statements.Empirical studies across multiple domains show that the framework is capable of modeling the structural dynamics of innovation and successfully highlights combinations with high disruptive potential. This research provides a new path for computationally guided scientific ideation grounded in structured reasoning and historical data modeling.

### AdaptiVocab: Enhancing LLM Efficiency in Focused Domains through   Lightweight Vocabulary Adaptation
**Authors**: Itay Nakash, Nitay Calderon, Eyal Ben David, Elad Hoffer, Roi Reichart

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:18:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general purpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance

**Authors**: Niketa Penumajji

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T14:02:10Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs for classifying emotions in speech through Mel Spectrogram representations of audio files. Traditional methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models have proven insufficient for practical deployment, prompting a shift towards deep learning techniques. By transforming audio data into a visual format, the CNN model autonomously learns to identify intricate patterns, enhancing classification accuracy. The developed model is integrated into a user-friendly graphical interface, facilitating realtime predictions and potential applications in educational environments. The study aims to advance the understanding of deep learning in speech emotion recognition, assess the models feasibility, and contribute to the integration of technology in learning contexts

### HausaNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Towards a Fine-Grained Model-Aware   Hallucination Detection
**Authors**: Maryam Bala, Amina Imam Abubakar, Abdulhamid Abubakar, Abdulkadir Shehu Bichi, Hafsa Kabir Ahmad, Sani Abdullahi Sani, Idris Abdulmumin, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhamad, Ibrahim Said Ahmad

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:40:22Z

**Summary**: This paper presents our findings of the Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, MU-SHROOM, which focuses on identifying hallucinations and related overgeneration errors in large language models (LLMs). The shared task involves detecting specific text spans that constitute hallucinations in the outputs generated by LLMs in 14 languages. To address this task, we aim to provide a nuanced, model-aware understanding of hallucination occurrences and severity in English. We used natural language inference and fine-tuned a ModernBERT model using a synthetic dataset of 400 samples, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.032 and a correlation score of 0.422. These results indicate a moderately positive correlation between the model's confidence scores and the actual presence of hallucinations. The IoU score indicates that our model has a relatively low overlap between the predicted hallucination span and the truth annotation. The performance is unsurprising, given the intricate nature of hallucination detection. Hallucinations often manifest subtly, relying on context, making pinpointing their exact boundaries formidable.

### PG-SAM: Prior-Guided SAM with Medical for Multi-organ Segmentation
**Authors**: Yiheng Zhong, Zihong Luo, Chengzhi Liu, Feilong Tang, Zelin Peng, Ming Hu, Yingzhen Hu, Jionglong Su, Zongyuan Geand, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:25:06Z

**Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates powerful zero-shot capabilities; however, its accuracy and robustness significantly decrease when applied to medical image segmentation. Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our anonymous code is released at https://github.com/logan-0623/PG-SAM.

**Authors**: Han Zhao, Haotian Wang, Yiping Peng, Sitong Zhao, Xiaoyu Tian, Shuaiting Chen, Yunjie Ji, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:19:46Z

**Summary**: The AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled is a large-scale dataset with thinking traces for general reasoning tasks, composed of high-quality and challenging reasoning problems. These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well. We are releasing these 1.4 million problems and their corresponding responses to the research community with the objective of fostering the development of powerful reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset was published in \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-1.4M}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-1.4M}.

### Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion for Ransomware Detection: A   Probabilistic Approach to Behavioral Anomaly Isolation
**Authors**: Vasili Iskorohodov, Maximilian Ravensdale, Matthias von Holstein, Hugo Petrovic, Adrian Yardley

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:14:37Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of cryptographic extortion techniques has necessitated the development of adaptive detection frameworks capable of identifying adversarial encryption behaviors without reliance on predefined signatures. Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.

### SeBS-Flow: Benchmarking Serverless Cloud Function Workflows
**Authors**: Larissa Schmid, Marcin Copik, Alexandru Calotoiu, Laurin Brandner, Anne Koziolek, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:10:28Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm, with a significant adoption rate among cloud customers. While this model offers advantages such as abstraction from the deployment and resource scheduling, it also poses limitations in handling complex use cases due to the restricted nature of individual functions. Serverless workflows address this limitation by orchestrating multiple functions into a cohesive application. However, existing serverless workflow platforms exhibit significant differences in their programming models and infrastructure, making fair and consistent performance evaluations difficult in practice. To address this gap, we propose the first serverless workflow benchmarking suite SeBS-Flow, providing a platform-agnostic workflow model that enables consistent benchmarking across various platforms. SeBS-Flow includes six real-world application benchmarks and four microbenchmarks representing different computational patterns. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three major cloud platforms, assessing performance, cost, scalability, and runtime deviations. We make our benchmark suite open-source, enabling rigorous and comparable evaluations of serverless workflows over time.

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:08:46Z

**Summary**: The optimization of nuclear engineering designs, such as nuclear fuel assembly configurations, involves managing competing objectives like reactivity control and power distribution. This study explores the use of Optimization by Prompting, an iterative approach utilizing large language models (LLMs), to address these challenges. The method is straightforward to implement, requiring no hyperparameter tuning or complex mathematical formulations. Optimization problems can be described in plain English, with only an evaluator and a parsing script needed for execution. The in-context learning capabilities of LLMs enable them to understand problem nuances, therefore, they have the potential to surpass traditional metaheuristic optimization methods. This study demonstrates the application of LLMs as optimizers to Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel lattice design, showing the capability of commercial LLMs to achieve superior optimization results compared to traditional methods.

### Exploring Next Token Prediction For Optimizing Databases
**Authors**: Yeasir Rayhan, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:08:26Z

**Summary**: The Next Token Prediction paradigm (NTP, for short) lies at the forefront of modern large foundational models that are pre-trained on diverse and large datasets. These models generalize effectively and have proven to be very successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Inspired by the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate whether the same NTP paradigm can also be applied to DBMS design and optimization tasks. Adopting NTP directly for database optimization is non-trivial due to the fundamental differences between the domains. In this paper, we present a framework termed Probe and Learn (PoLe) for applying NTP to optimize database systems. PoLe leverages Decision Transformers and hardware-generated tokens to effectively incorporate NTP into database systems. Preliminary results from the main-memory index scheduling task demonstrate that adopting NTP can improve both performance and generalizability.

### ProtoGS: Efficient and High-Quality Rendering with 3D Gaussian   Prototypes
**Authors**: Zhengqing Gao, Dongting Hu, Jia-Wang Bian, Huan Fu, Yan Li, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, Kun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T13:03:48Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in novel view synthesis but is limited by the substantial number of Gaussian primitives required, posing challenges for deployment on lightweight devices. Recent methods address this issue by compressing the storage size of densified Gaussians, yet fail to preserve rendering quality and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets prove that we outperform existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of Gaussians, and enabling high rendering speed while maintaining or even enhancing rendering fidelity.

**Summary**: The organization of latent knowledge within large-scale models poses unique challenges when addressing overlapping representations and optimizing contextual accuracy. Conceptual redundancies embedded across layers often result in inefficiencies that affect both computational demands and task-specific outcomes. A framework was proposed to restructure these redundancies through advanced clustering techniques and dynamic thresholding, ensuring that critical semantic relationships are preserved while removing unnecessary overlaps. Evaluations revealed improved memory efficiency and faster inference times, alongside better alignment in latent knowledge clusters that enhanced interpretability. Improvements in error rates and adversarial robustness suggest that restructuring redundancies has broader implications for increasing model reliability across diverse applications. Comparative analyses highlighted reductions in resource consumption and notable gains in performance, particularly in translation and summarization tasks. Energy metrics demonstrated significant savings during training phases, further validating the practicality of the approach for real-world deployments. Representational fidelity was also enhanced, with latent space evaluations indicating better cluster alignment and higher semantic consistency. The methodology bridges a key gap in model optimization through directly addressing redundancies at the structural level. Its application opens avenues for scalable, efficient, and contextually aware systems that can adapt to complex, domain-specific tasks without compromising on performance.

### RL-finetuning LLMs from on- and off-policy data with a single algorithm
**Authors**: Yunhao Tang, Taco Cohen, David W. Zhang, Michal Valko, Rémi Munos

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:52:38Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm (AGRO, for Any-Generation Reward Optimization) for fine-tuning large-language models. AGRO leverages the concept of generation consistency, which states that the optimal policy satisfies the notion of consistency across any possible generation of the model. We derive algorithms that find optimal solutions via the sample-based policy gradient and provide theoretical guarantees on their convergence. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AGRO in both on-policy and off-policy settings, showing improved performance on the mathematical reasoning dataset over baseline algorithms.

### Does Safety Training of LLMs Generalize to Semantically Related Natural   Prompts?
**Authors**: Sravanti Addepalli, Yerram Varun, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:49:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaks that lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences using safety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.

### Enabling Rapid Shared Human-AI Mental Model Alignment via the   After-Action Review
**Authors**: Edward Gu, Ho Chit Siu, Melanie Platt, Isabelle Hurley, Jaime Peña, Rohan Paleja

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:43:18Z

**Summary**: In this work, we present two novel contributions toward improving research in human-machine teaming (HMT): 1) a Minecraft testbed to accelerate testing and deployment of collaborative AI agents and 2) a tool to allow users to revisit and analyze behaviors within an HMT episode to facilitate shared mental model development. Our browser-based Minecraft testbed allows for rapid testing of collaborative agents in a continuous-space, real-time, partially-observable environment with real humans without cumbersome setup typical to human-AI interaction user studies. As Minecraft has an extensive player base and a rich ecosystem of pre-built AI agents, we hope this contribution can help to facilitate research quickly in the design of new collaborative agents and in understanding different human factors within HMT. Our mental model alignment tool facilitates user-led post-mission analysis by including video displays of first-person perspectives of the team members (i.e., the human and AI) that can be replayed, and a chat interface that leverages GPT-4 to provide answers to various queries regarding the AI's experiences and model details.

### Innate Reasoning is Not Enough: In-Context Learning Enhances Reasoning   Large Language Models with Less Overthinking
**Authors**: Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Lizhe Chen, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:37:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs), which employ extended thinking processes with reflection and self-correction capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of test-time scaling. RLLMs exhibit innate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capability obtained from training, leading to a natural question: "Is CoT prompting, a popular In-Context Learning (ICL) method for chat LLMs, necessary to enhance the reasoning capability of RLLMs?" In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impacts of Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT on RLLMs across mathematical reasoning tasks. We examine models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, finding that contrary to concerns, CoT prompting significantly enhances RLLMs' performance in most scenarios. Our results reveal distinct patterns: large-capacity models show minimal improvement on simple tasks but substantial gains on complex problems, while smaller models exhibit the opposite behavior. Further analysis demonstrates that CoT prompting effectively controls the distribution of the numbers of thinking tokens and reasoning steps, reducing excessive reflections by approximately 90% in some cases. Moreover, attention logits analysis reveals the RLLMs' overfitting to reflection-related words, which is mitigated by external CoT guidance. Notably, our experiments indicate that for RLLMs, one-shot CoT consistently yields superior performance compared to Few-shot CoT approaches. Our findings provide important insights for optimizing RLLMs' performance through appropriate prompting strategies.

### HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural   Language
**Authors**: Dimitrios Stamatios Bouras, Yihan Dai, Tairan Wang, Yingfei Xiong, Sergey Mechtaev

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:30:30Z

**Summary**: While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against natural language requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program analysis and verification to natural language artifacts. Drawing inspiration from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various points in the code. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 62% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by increasing the MCC by 93%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 28% boost to MCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.

**Authors**: Giovanni Franco Gabriel Marraffini, Andrés Cotton, Noe Fabian Hsueh, Axel Fridman, Juan Wisznia, Luciano Del Corro

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:29:53Z

**Summary**: The question of how to make decisions that maximise the well-being of all persons is very relevant to design language models that are beneficial to humanity and free from harm. We introduce the Greatest Good Benchmark to evaluate the moral judgments of LLMs using utilitarian dilemmas. Our analysis across 15 diverse LLMs reveals consistently encoded moral preferences that diverge from established moral theories and lay population moral standards. Most LLMs have a marked preference for impartial beneficence and rejection of instrumental harm. These findings showcase the 'artificial moral compass' of LLMs, offering insights into their moral alignment.

### Perception-Enhanced Multitask Multimodal Semantic Communication for   UAV-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication System
**Authors**: Ziji Guo, Haonan Tong, Zhilong Zhang, Danpu Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:21:12Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled their widespread deployment in critical applications such as emergency management. This paper investigates the challenge of efficient multitask multimodal data communication in UAV-assisted ISAC systems, in the considered system model, hyperspectral (HSI) and LiDAR data are collected by UAV-mounted sensors for both target classification and data reconstruction at the terrestrial BS. The limited channel capacity and complex environmental conditions pose significant challenges to effective air-to-ground communication. To tackle this issue, we propose a perception-enhanced multitask multimodal semantic communication (PE-MMSC) system that strategically leverages the onboard computational and sensing capabilities of UAVs. In particular, we first propose a robust multimodal feature fusion method that adaptively combines HSI and LiDAR semantics while considering channel noise and task requirements. Then the method introduces a perception-enhanced (PE) module incorporating attention mechanisms to perform coarse classification on UAV side, thereby optimizing the attention-based multimodal fusion and transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PE-MMSC system achieves 5\%--10\% higher target classification accuracy compared to conventional systems without PE module, while maintaining comparable data reconstruction quality with acceptable computational overheads.

### Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A   Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond
**Authors**: Chongyu Fan, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Anil Ramakrishna, Mingyi Hong, Sijia Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:18:42Z

**Summary**: The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Smooth.

**Authors**: Steven Abreu, Sumit Bam Shrestha, Rui-Jie Zhu, Jason Eshraghian

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T12:05:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but require large amounts of energy. In this work, we present a MatMul-free LLM architecture adapted for Intel's neuromorphic processor, Loihi 2. Our approach leverages Loihi 2's support for low-precision, event-driven computation and stateful processing. Our hardware-aware quantized model on GPU demonstrates that a 370M parameter MatMul-free model can be quantized with no accuracy loss. Based on preliminary results, we report up to 3x higher throughput with 2x less energy, compared to transformer-based LLMs on an edge GPU, with significantly better scaling. Further hardware optimizations will increase throughput and decrease energy consumption. These results show the potential of neuromorphic hardware for efficient inference and pave the way for efficient reasoning models capable of generating complex, long-form text rapidly and cost-effectively.

### Context-Efficient Retrieval with Factual Decomposition
**Authors**: Yanhong Li, David Yunis, David McAllester, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:48:22Z

**Summary**: There has recently been considerable interest in incorporating information retrieval into large language models (LLMs). Retrieval from a dynamically expanding external corpus of text allows a model to incorporate current events and can be viewed as a form of episodic memory. Here we demonstrate that pre-processing the external corpus into semi-structured ''atomic facts'' makes retrieval more efficient. More specifically, we demonstrate that our particular form of atomic facts improves performance on various question answering tasks when the amount of retrieved text is limited. Limiting the amount of retrieval reduces the size of the context and improves inference efficiency.

### Motif Counting in Complex Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
**Authors**: Haozhe Yin, Kai Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Yizhang He, Ying Zhang, Xuemin Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:48:05Z

**Summary**: Motif counting plays a crucial role in understanding the structural properties of networks. By computing motif frequencies, researchers can draw key insights into the structural properties of the underlying network. As networks become increasingly complex, different graph models have been proposed, giving rise to diverse motif patterns. These variations introduce unique computational challenges that require specialized algorithms tailored to specific motifs within different graph structures. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of motif counting techniques across general graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and hypergraphs. We categorize existing algorithms according to their underlying computational strategies, emphasizing key similarities and distinctions. In addition to reviewing current methodologies, we examine their strengths, limitations, and computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we explore future directions in motif counting, including scalable implementations to improve efficiency in large-scale networks, algorithmic adaptations for dynamic, temporal, and attributed graphs, and deeper integration with large language models (LLMs) and graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG). By offering a detailed analysis of these approaches, this survey aims to support researchers and practitioners in advancing motif counting for increasingly complex network data.

### To FP8 and Back Again: Quantifying Reduced Precision Effects on LLM   Training Stability
**Authors**: Joonhyung Lee, Jeongin Bae, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:11:03Z

**Summary**: The massive computational costs associated with large language model (LLM) pretraining have spurred great interest in reduced-precision floating-point representations to accelerate the process. As a result, the BrainFloat16 (BF16) precision has become the de facto standard for LLM training, with hardware support included in recent generations of accelerators. This trend has gone even further in the latest processors, where FP8 has recently been introduced. However, prior experience with FP16, which was found to be less stable than BF16, raises concerns as to whether FP8, with even fewer bits than FP16, can be a cost-effective option for LLM training. We argue that reduced-precision training schemes must have similar training stability and hyperparameter sensitivities to their higher-precision counterparts in order to be cost-effective. However, we find that currently available methods for FP8 training are not robust enough to allow their use as economical replacements. This prompts us to investigate the stability of reduced-precision LLM training in terms of robustness across random seeds, learning rates, and datasets. To this end, we propose new evaluation techniques and a new metric for quantifying loss landscape sharpness in autoregressive language models. By simulating incremental bit reductions in floating-point representations, we analyze the relationship between representational power and training stability with the intent of aiding future research into the field.

**Authors**: Zeyu Qin, Qingxiu Dong, Xingxing Zhang, Li Dong, Xiaolong Huang, Ziyi Yang, Mahmoud Khademi, Dongdong Zhang, Hany Hassan Awadalla, Yi R. Fung, Weizhu Chen, Minhao Cheng, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:07:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, largely driven by high-quality web data used in pre-training. However, recent studies indicate this data source is rapidly depleting. Synthetic data emerges as a promising alternative, but it remains unclear whether synthetic datasets exhibit predictable scalability comparable to raw pre-training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by introducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora into diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by automatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple documents using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical experiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that reliably adheres to the \emph{rectified scaling law} across various model sizes; (2) Performance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models approach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B model peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons with existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate that SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability. Our findings highlight synthetic data as a scalable and reliable alternative to organic pre-training corpora, offering a viable path toward continued improvement in model performance.

### LinkAlign: Scalable Schema Linking for Real-World Large-Scale   Multi-Database Text-to-SQL
**Authors**: Yihan Wang, Peiyu Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:04:18Z

**Summary**: Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in achieving human-level performance in Text-to-SQL tasks, particularly in real-world large-scale multi-database scenarios. Addressing schema linking faces two major challenges: (1) Database Retrieval: selecting the correct database from a large schema pool in multi-database settings, while filtering out irrelevant ones. (2) Schema Item Grounding: accurately identifying the relevant tables and columns from within a large and redundant schema for SQL generation. To address this, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework that can effectively adapt existing baselines to real-world environments by systematically addressing schema linking. Our framework comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. We evaluate our method performance of schema linking on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, and the ability to adapt existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world environments on the SPIDER 2.0-lite benchmark. Experiments show that LinkAlign outperforms existing baselines in multi-database settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. On the other hand, our method ranks highest among models excluding those using long chain-of-thought reasoning LLMs. This work bridges the gap between current research and real-world scenarios, providing a practical solution for robust and scalable schema linking. The codes are available at https://github.com/Satissss/LinkAlign.

### On-Chain Analysis of Smart Contract Dependency Risks on Ethereum
**Authors**: Monica Jin, Raphina Liu, Martin Monperrus

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T11:02:08Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of smart contract dependencies, analyzing over 41 million contracts and 11 billion interactions on Ethereum up to December 2024. Our results yield four key insights: (1) 59% of contract transactions involve multiple contracts (median of 4 per transaction in 2024) indicating potential smart contract dependency risks; (2) the ecosystem exhibits extreme centralization, with just 11 (0.001%) deployers controlling 20.5 million (50%) of alive contracts, with major risks related to factory contracts and deployer privileges; (3) three most depended-upon contracts are mutable, meaning large parts of the ecosystem rely on contracts that can be altered at any time, which is a significant risk, (4) actual smart contract protocol dependencies are significantly more complex than officially documented, undermining Ethereum's transparency ethos, and creating unnecessary attack surface. Our work provides the first large-scale empirical foundation for understanding smart contract dependency risks, offering crucial insights for developers, users, and security researchers in the blockchain space.

### The HalluRAG Dataset: Detecting Closed-Domain Hallucinations in RAG   Applications Using an LLM's Internal States
**Authors**: Fabian Ridder, Malte Schilling

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:50:21Z

**Summary**: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) is critical for enhancing their reliability and trustworthiness. Most research focuses on hallucinations as deviations from information seen during training. However, the opaque nature of an LLM's parametric knowledge complicates the understanding of why generated texts appear ungrounded: The LLM might not have picked up the necessary knowledge from large and often inaccessible datasets, or the information might have been changed or contradicted during further training. Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in training, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged after a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting them at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We present HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these hallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on HalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results show that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that answerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate classifiers for these categories improved accuracy. However, HalluRAG showed some limited generalizability, advocating for more diversity in datasets on hallucinations.

### FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Dahyun Jung, Seungyoon Lee, Hyeonseok Moon, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:48:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced interactions between users and models. These advancements concurrently underscore the need for rigorous safety evaluations due to the manifestation of social biases, which can lead to harmful societal impacts. Despite these concerns, existing benchmarks may overlook the intrinsic weaknesses of LLMs, which can generate biased responses even with simple adversarial instructions. To address this critical gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios (FLEX), designed to test whether LLMs can sustain fairness even when exposed to prompts constructed to induce bias. To thoroughly evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we integrate prompts that amplify potential biases into the fairness assessment. Comparative experiments between FLEX and existing benchmarks demonstrate that traditional evaluations may underestimate the inherent risks in models. This highlights the need for more stringent LLM evaluation benchmarks to guarantee safety and fairness.

### Agent-Initiated Interaction in Phone UI Automation
**Authors**: Noam Kahlon, Guy Rom, Anatoly Efros, Filippo Galgani, Omri Berkovitch, Sapir Caduri, William E. Bishop, Oriana Riva, Ido Dagan

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:46:08Z

**Summary**: Phone automation agents aim to autonomously perform a given natural-language user request, such as scheduling appointments or booking a hotel. While much research effort has been devoted to screen understanding and action planning, complex tasks often necessitate user interaction for successful completion. Aligning the agent with the user's expectations is crucial for building trust and enabling personalized experiences. This requires the agent to proactively engage the user when necessary, avoiding actions that violate their preferences while refraining from unnecessary questions where a default action is expected. We argue that such subtle agent-initiated interaction with the user deserves focused research attention.   To promote such research, this paper introduces a task formulation for detecting the need for user interaction and generating appropriate messages. We thoroughly define the task, including aspects like interaction timing and the scope of the agent's autonomy. Using this definition, we derived annotation guidelines and created AndroidInteraction, a diverse dataset for the task, leveraging an existing UI automation dataset. We tested several text-based and multimodal baseline models for the task, finding that it is very challenging for current LLMs. We suggest that our task formulation, dataset, baseline models and analysis will be valuable for future UI automation research, specifically in addressing this crucial yet often overlooked aspect of agent-initiated interaction. This work provides a needed foundation to allow personalized agents to properly engage the user when needed, within the context of phone UI automation.

**Authors**: Maurizio Boccia, Veronica Dal Sasso, Leonardo Lamorgese, Carlo Mannino, Paolo Ventura

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:42:19Z

**Summary**: Union Pacific (UP) is one of the largest transportation companies in the world, with over 50.000 kms of rail network covering 23 states in the United States. In 2017 Union Pacific embarked on a project that within 5 years would lead it to become the only rail operator in the world equipped with a technology capable of fully automating the real-time management and optimization of train traffic. In 2021 the main milestone of such project has been reached with the first deployment of the automated dispatching system we present here. To attack such large and complex problem, we decomposed it into distinct but interrelated functional components, and developed optimization models and methods to handle such components. The models communicate with each other through variables and constraints, and by a careful timing of invocations. In this paper we give an overview of the overall approach.

### VectorFit : Adaptive Singular & Bias Vector Fine-Tuning of Pre-trained   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Suhas G Hegde, Shilpy Kaur, Aruna Tiwari

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:36:27Z

**Summary**: Popular PEFT methods achieve parameter efficiency by assuming that incremental weight updates are inherently low-rank, which often leads to a performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. While recent methods have attempted to address this limitation, they typically lack sufficient parameter and memory efficiency. We propose VectorFit, an effective and easily deployable approach that adaptively trains the singular vectors and biases of pre-trained weight matrices. We demonstrate that the utilization of structural and transformational characteristics of pre-trained weights enables high-rank updates comparable to those of full fine-tuning. As a result, VectorFit achieves superior performance with 9X less trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Through extensive experiments over 17 datasets spanning diverse language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we exhibit that VectorFit consistently outperforms baselines, even in extremely low-budget scenarios.

### DynFocus: Dynamic Cooperative Network Empowers LLMs with Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Yudong Han, Qingpei Guo, Liyuan Pan, Liu Liu, Yu Guan, Ming Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:31:35Z

**Summary**: The challenge in LLM-based video understanding lies in preserving visual and semantic information in long videos while maintaining a memory-affordable token count. However, redundancy and correspondence in videos have hindered the performance potential of existing methods. Through statistical learning on current datasets, we observe that redundancy occurs in both repeated and answer-irrelevant frames, and the corresponding frames vary with different questions. This suggests the possibility of adopting dynamic encoding to balance detailed video information preservation with token budget reduction. To this end, we propose a dynamic cooperative network, DynFocus, for memory-efficient video encoding in this paper. Specifically, i) a Dynamic Event Prototype Estimation (DPE) module to dynamically select meaningful frames for question answering; (ii) a Compact Cooperative Encoding (CCE) module that encodes meaningful frames with detailed visual appearance and the remaining frames with sketchy perception separately. We evaluate our method on five publicly available benchmarks, and experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.

### Natural Language Generation
**Authors**: Emiel van Miltenburg, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T10:03:25Z

**Summary**: This article provides a brief overview of the field of Natural Language Generation. The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.

### Lost in Time: A New Temporal Benchmark for VideoLLMs
**Authors**: Daniel Cores, Michael Dorkenwald, Manuel Mucientes, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:46:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance when integrated with vision models even enabling video understanding. However, evaluating video models presents its own unique challenges, for which several benchmarks have been proposed. In this paper, we show that the currently most used video-language benchmarks can be solved without requiring much temporal reasoning. We identified three main issues in existing datasets: (i) static information from single frames is often sufficient to solve the tasks (ii) the text of the questions and candidate answers is overly informative, allowing models to answer correctly without relying on any visual input (iii) world knowledge alone can answer many of the questions, making the benchmarks a test of knowledge replication rather than video reasoning. In addition, we found that open-ended question-answering benchmarks for video understanding suffer from similar issues while the automatic evaluation process with LLMs is unreliable, making it an unsuitable alternative. As a solution, we propose TVBench, a novel open-source video multiple-choice question-answering benchmark, and demonstrate through extensive evaluations that it requires a high level of temporal understanding. Surprisingly, we find that most recent state-of-the-art video-language models perform similarly to random performance on TVBench, with only a few models such as Qwen2-VL, and Tarsier clearly surpassing this baseline.

### RoboMatrix: A Skill-centric Hierarchical Framework for Scalable Robot   Task Planning and Execution in Open-World
**Authors**: Weixin Mao, Weiheng Zhong, Zhou Jiang, Dong Fang, Zhongyue Zhang, Zihan Lan, Haosheng Li, Fan Jia, Tiancai Wang, Haoqiang Fan, Osamu Yoshie

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:43:25Z

**Summary**: Existing robot policies predominantly adopt the task-centric approach, requiring end-to-end task data collection. This results in limited generalization to new tasks and difficulties in pinpointing errors within long-horizon, multi-stage tasks. To address this, we propose RoboMatrix, a skill-centric hierarchical framework designed for scalable robot task planning and execution in open-world environments. RoboMatrix extracts general meta-skills from diverse complex tasks, enabling the completion of unseen tasks through skill composition. Its architecture consists of a high-level scheduling layer that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for task decomposition, an intermediate skill layer housing meta-skill models, and a low-level hardware layer for robot control. A key innovation of our work is the introduction of the first unified vision-language-action (VLA) model capable of seamlessly integrating both movement and manipulation within one model. This is achieved by combining vision and language prompts to generate discrete actions. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMatrix achieves a 50% higher success rate than task-centric baselines when applied to unseen objects, scenes, and tasks. To advance open-world robotics research, we will open-source code, hardware designs, model weights, and datasets at https://github.com/WayneMao/RoboMatrix.

### T-MAC: CPU Renaissance via Table Lookup for Low-Bit LLM Deployment on   Edge
**Authors**: Jianyu Wei, Shijie Cao, Ting Cao, Lingxiao Ma, Lei Wang, Yanyong Zhang, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:27:16Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important to enhance on-device intelligence. Weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory footprint of LLMs on devices. However, low-bit LLMs necessitate mixed precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) of low precision weights and high precision activations during inference. Existing systems, lacking native support for mpGEMM, resort to dequantize weights for high precision computation. Such an indirect way can lead to a significant inference overhead.   In this paper, we introduce T-MAC, an innovative lookup table(LUT)-based method designed for efficient low-bit LLM (i.e., weight-quantized LLM) inference on CPUs. T-MAC directly supports mpGEMM without dequantization, while simultaneously eliminating multiplications and reducing additions required. Specifically, T-MAC transforms the traditional data-type-centric multiplication to bit-wise table lookup, and enables a unified and scalable mpGEMM solution.   Our LUT-based kernels scale linearly to the weight bit-width. Evaluated on low-bit Llama and BitNet models, T-MAC demonstrates up to 4x increase in throughput and 70% reduction in energy consumption compared to llama.cpp. For BitNet-b1.58-3B, T-MAC delivers a token generation throughput of 30 tokens/s with a single core and 71 tokens/s with eight cores on M2-Ultra, and 11 tokens/s on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi 5, which significantly exceeds the adult average reading speed. T-MAC with LUT-based computing paradigm, paves the way for the practical deployment of low-bit LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising computational efficiency. The system is open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/T-MAC .

### Multi-hop Differential Topology based Algorithms for Resilient Network   of UAV Swarm
**Authors**: Huan Lin, Lianghui Ding

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:27:03Z

**Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks face severe challenges of communication network split (CNS) issues caused by massive damage in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to restore network connectivity by repositioning remaining UAVs based on damage information within local topologies. Particularly, the locations of destroyed UAVs distributed in gaps between disconnected sub-nets are considered for recovery trajectory planning. Specifically, we construct the multi-hop differential sub-graph (MDSG) to represent local damage-varying topologies. Based on this, we develop two distinct algorithms to address CNS issues. The first approach leverages an artificial potential field algorithm to calculate the recovery velocities via MDSG, enabling simple deployment on low-intelligence UAVs. In the second approach, we design an MDSG-based graph convolution framework to find the recovery topology for high-intelligence swarms. As per the unique topology of MDSG, we propose a novel bipartite graph convolution operation, enhanced with a batch-processing mechanism to improve graph convolution efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms expedite the recovery with significant margin while improving the spatial coverage and topology degree uniformity after recovery.

### KSHSeek: Data-Driven Approaches to Mitigating and Detecting   Knowledge-Shortcut Hallucinations in Generative Models
**Authors**: Zhiwei Wang, Zhongxin Liu, Ying Li, Hongyu Sun, Meng Xu, Yuqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:18:27Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the development of natural language processing (NLP), especially in text generation tasks like question answering. However, model hallucinations remain a major challenge in natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their complex causes. We systematically expand on the causes of factual hallucinations from the perspective of knowledge shortcuts, analyzing hallucinations arising from correct and defect-free data and demonstrating that knowledge-shortcut hallucinations are prevalent in generative models. To mitigate this issue, we propose a high similarity pruning algorithm at the data preprocessing level to reduce spurious correlations in the data. Additionally, we design a specific detection method for knowledge-shortcut hallucinations to evaluate the effectiveness of our mitigation strategy. Experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces knowledge-shortcut hallucinations, particularly in fine-tuning tasks, without negatively impacting model performance in question answering. This work introduces a new paradigm for mitigating specific hallucination issues in generative models, enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world applications.

### Lightweight Embedded FPGA Deployment of Learned Image Compression with   Knowledge Distillation and Hybrid Quantization
**Authors**: Alaa Mazouz, Sumanta Chaudhuri, Marco Cagnanzzo, Mihai Mitrea, Enzo Tartaglione, Attilio Fiandrotti

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:08:09Z

**Summary**: Learnable Image Compression (LIC) has shown the potential to outperform standardized video codecs in RD efficiency, prompting the research for hardware-friendly implementations. Most existing LIC hardware implementations prioritize latency to RD-efficiency and through an extensive exploration of the hardware design space. We present a novel design paradigm where the burden of tuning the design for a specific hardware platform is shifted towards model dimensioning and without compromising on RD-efficiency. First, we design a framework for distilling a leaner student LIC model from a reference teacher: by tuning a single model hyperparameters, we can meet the constraints of different hardware platforms without a complex hardware design exploration. Second, we propose a hardware-friendly implementation of the Generalized Divisive Normalization - GDN activation that preserves RD efficiency even post parameter quantization. Third, we design a pipelined FPGA configuration which takes full advantage of available FPGA resources by leveraging parallel processing and optimizing resource allocation. Our experiments with a state of the art LIC model show that we outperform all existing FPGA implementations while performing very close to the original model.

### RelationField: Relate Anything in Radiance Fields
**Authors**: Sebastian Koch, Johanna Wald, Mirco Colosi, Narunas Vaskevicius, Pedro Hermosilla, Federico Tombari, Timo Ropinski

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:06:08Z

**Summary**: Neural radiance fields are an emerging 3D scene representation and recently even been extended to learn features for scene understanding by distilling open-vocabulary features from vision-language models. However, current method primarily focus on object-centric representations, supporting object segmentation or detection, while understanding semantic relationships between objects remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose RelationField, the first method to extract inter-object relationships directly from neural radiance fields. RelationField represents relationships between objects as pairs of rays within a neural radiance field, effectively extending its formulation to include implicit relationship queries. To teach RelationField complex, open-vocabulary relationships, relationship knowledge is distilled from multi-modal LLMs. To evaluate RelationField, we solve open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation tasks and relationship-guided instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. See the project website at https://relationfield.github.io.

### ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Mingyang Chen, Tianpeng Li, Haoze Sun, Yijie Zhou, Chenzheng Zhu, Fan Yang, Zenan Zhou, Weipeng Chen, Haofen Wang, Jeff Z. Pan, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T09:00:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.

### Data-centric Federated Graph Learning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bo Yan, Zhongjian Zhang, Huabin Sun, Mengmei Zhang, Yang Cao, Chuan Shi

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:43:08Z

**Summary**: In federated graph learning (FGL), a complete graph is divided into multiple subgraphs stored in each client due to privacy concerns, and all clients jointly train a global graph model by only transmitting model parameters. A pain point of FGL is the heterogeneity problem, where nodes or structures present non-IID properties among clients (e.g., different node label distributions), dramatically undermining the convergence and performance of FGL. To address this, existing efforts focus on design strategies at the model level, i.e., they design models to extract common knowledge to mitigate heterogeneity. However, these model-level strategies fail to fundamentally address the heterogeneity problem as the model needs to be designed from scratch when transferring to other tasks. Motivated by large language models (LLMs) having achieved remarkable success, we aim to utilize LLMs to fully understand and augment local text-attributed graphs, to address data heterogeneity at the data level. In this paper, we propose a general framework LLM4FGL that innovatively decomposes the task of LLM for FGL into two sub-tasks theoretically. Specifically, for each client, it first utilizes the LLM to generate missing neighbors and then infers connections between generated nodes and raw nodes. To improve the quality of generated nodes, we design a novel federated generation-and-reflection mechanism for LLMs, without the need to modify the parameters of the LLM but relying solely on the collective feedback from all clients. After neighbor generation, all the clients utilize a pre-trained edge predictor to infer the missing edges. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly integrate as a plug-in with existing FGL methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to advanced baselines.

### VecTrans: LLM Transformation Framework for Better Auto-vectorization on   High-performance CPU
**Authors**: Zhongchun Zheng, Long Cheng, Lu Li, Rodrigo C. O. Rocha, Tianyi Liu, Wei Wei, Xianwei Zhang, Yaoqing Gao

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:39:35Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in code generation, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. Vectorization, a crucial optimization for enhancing code performance, often fails because of the compiler's inability to recognize complex code patterns, which commonly require extensive empirical expertise. LLMs, with their ability to capture intricate patterns, thus providing a promising solution to this challenge. This paper presents VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compiler's auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. Experimental results show that among all 50 TSVC functions unvectorizable by Clang, GCC, and BiShengCompiler, VecTrans successfully vectorizes 23 cases (46%) and achieves an average speedup of 2.02x, greatly surpassing state-of-the-art performance.

### Large Language Model for Patent Concept Generation
**Authors**: Runtao Ren, Jian Ma, Jianxi Luo

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:24:19Z

**Summary**: In traditional innovation practices, concept and IP generation are often iteratively integrated. Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests. Our method not only provides new insights into data-driven innovation but also paves a new path to fine-tune LLMs for applications in the context of technology. We also discuss the managerial and policy implications of AI-generating inventions in the future.

### Enhanced Bloom's Educational Taxonomy for Fostering Information Literacy   in the Era of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yiming Luo, Ting Liu, Patrick Cheong-Iao Pang, Dana McKay, Ziqi Chen, George Buchanan, Shanton Chang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:23:49Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed the paradigms of information retrieval and problem-solving, enabling students to access information acquisition more efficiently to support learning. However, there is currently a lack of standardized evaluation frameworks that guide learners in effectively leveraging LLMs. This paper proposes an LLM-driven Bloom's Educational Taxonomy that aims to recognize and evaluate students' information literacy (IL) with LLMs, and to formalize and guide students practice-based activities of using LLMs to solve complex problems. The framework delineates the IL corresponding to the cognitive abilities required to use LLM into two distinct stages: Exploration & Action and Creation & Metacognition. It further subdivides these into seven phases: Perceiving, Searching, Reasoning, Interacting, Evaluating, Organizing, and Curating. Through the case presentation, the analysis demonstrates the framework's applicability and feasibility, supporting its role in fostering IL among students with varying levels of prior knowledge. This framework fills the existing gap in the analysis of LLM usage frameworks and provides theoretical support for guiding learners to improve IL.

### DeCAP: Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation for Debiasing Zero-shot   Question Answering in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Suyoung Bae, YunSeok Choi, Jee-Hyong Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:16:35Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot Question Answering (QA), they tend to expose biases in their internal knowledge when faced with socially sensitive questions, leading to a degradation in performance. Existing zero-shot methods are efficient but fail to consider context and prevent bias propagation in the answers. To address this, we propose DeCAP, a method for debiasing LLMs using Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation. DeCAP leverages a Question Ambiguity Detection to take appropriate debiasing actions based on the context and a Neutral Answer Guidance Generation to suppress the LLMs make objective judgments about the context, minimizing the propagation of bias from their internal knowledge. Our various experiments across eight LLMs show that DeCAP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot debiased QA performance. This demonstrates DeCAP's efficacy in enhancing the fairness and accuracy of LLMs in diverse QA settings.

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T08:10:15Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have recently exhibited remarkable capabilities in general video understanding. However, they mainly focus on holistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and temporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their advancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to empower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e., enabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video. Specially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent data engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level video instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the VideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to capture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we meticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the spatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across various aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our VideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring benchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.

### Every SAM Drop Counts: Embracing Semantic Priors for Multi-Modality   Image Fusion and Beyond
**Authors**: Guanyao Wu, Haoyu Liu, Hongming Fu, Yichuan Peng, Jinyuan Liu, Xin Fan, Risheng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T07:55:55Z

**Summary**: Multi-modality image fusion, particularly infrared and visible, plays a crucial role in integrating diverse modalities to enhance scene understanding. Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging. Recent approaches attempt task-specific design but rarely achieve "The Best of Both Worlds" due to inconsistent optimization goals. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Grow the quality of fusion results and Enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a balance between high-quality visual results and downstream task adaptability while maintaining practical deployment efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/RollingPlain/SAGE_IVIF.

### LangBridge: Interpreting Image as a Combination of Language Embeddings
**Authors**: Jiaqi Liao, Yuwei Niu, Fanqing Meng, Hao Li, Changyao Tian, Yinuo Du, Yuwen Xiong, Dianqi Li, Xizhou Zhu, Li Yuan, Jifeng Dai, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T03:46:53Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which have achieved human-level performance across various complex vision-language tasks. Following LLaVA's paradigm, mainstream LVLMs typically employ a shallow MLP for visual-language alignment through a two-stage training process: pretraining for cross-modal alignment followed by instruction tuning. While this approach has proven effective, the underlying mechanisms of how MLPs bridge the modality gap remain poorly understood. Although some research has explored how LLMs process transformed visual tokens, few studies have investigated the fundamental alignment mechanism. Furthermore, the MLP adapter requires retraining whenever switching LLM backbones. To address these limitations, we first investigate the working principles of MLP adapters and discover that they learn to project visual embeddings into subspaces spanned by corresponding text embeddings progressively. Based on this insight, we propose LangBridge, a novel adapter that explicitly maps visual tokens to linear combinations of LLM vocabulary embeddings. This innovative design enables pretraining-free adapter transfer across different LLMs while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a LangBridge adapter pre-trained on Qwen2-0.5B can be directly applied to larger models such as LLaMA3-8B or Qwen2.5-14B while maintaining competitive performance. Overall, LangBridge enables interpretable vision-language alignment by grounding visual representations in LLM vocab embedding, while its plug-and-play design ensures efficient reuse across multiple LLMs with nearly no performance degradation.

**Summary**: Apparel is essential to human life, offering protection, mirroring cultural identities, and showcasing personal style. Yet, the creation of garments remains a time-consuming process, largely due to the manual work involved in designing them. To simplify this process, we introduce AIpparel, a multimodal foundation model for generating and editing sewing patterns. Our model fine-tunes state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) on a custom-curated large-scale dataset of over 120,000 unique garments, each with multimodal annotations including text, images, and sewing patterns. Additionally, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that concisely encodes these complex sewing patterns so that LLMs can learn to predict them efficiently. AIpparel achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-modal tasks, including text-to-garment and image-to-garment prediction, and enables novel multimodal garment generation applications such as interactive garment editing. The project website is at https://georgenakayama.github.io/AIpparel/.

### Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and   Rollover Budget Forcing
**Authors**: Jaihoon Kim, Taehoon Yoon, Jisung Hwang, Minhyuk Sung

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T06:30:45Z

**Summary**: We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

**Summary**: Document content extraction is a critical task in computer vision, underpinning the data needs of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Despite recent progress, current document parsing methods have not been fairly and comprehensively evaluated due to the narrow coverage of document types and the simplified, unrealistic evaluation procedures in existing benchmarks. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniDocBench, a novel benchmark featuring high-quality annotations across nine document sources, including academic papers, textbooks, and more challenging cases such as handwritten notes and densely typeset newspapers. OmniDocBench supports flexible, multi-level evaluations--ranging from an end-to-end assessment to the task-specific and attribute--based analysis using 19 layout categories and 15 attribute labels. We conduct a thorough evaluation of both pipeline-based methods and end-to-end vision-language models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different document types. OmniDocBench sets a new standard for the fair, diverse, and fine-grained evaluation in document parsing. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/opendatalab/OmniDocBench.

### MCRanker: Generating Diverse Criteria On-the-Fly to Improve Point-wise   LLM Rankers
**Authors**: Fang Guo, Wenyu Li, Honglei Zhuang, Yun Luo, Yafu Li, Le Yan, Qi Zhu, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T06:08:47Z

**Summary**: The most recent pointwise Large Language Model (LLM) rankers have achieved remarkable ranking results. However, these rankers are hindered by two major drawbacks: (1) they fail to follow a standardized comparison guidance during the ranking process, and (2) they struggle with comprehensive considerations when dealing with complicated passages. To address these shortcomings, we propose to build a ranker that generates ranking scores based on a set of criteria from various perspectives. These criteria are intended to direct each perspective in providing a distinct yet synergistic evaluation. Our research, which examines eight datasets from the BEIR benchmark demonstrates that incorporating this multi-perspective criteria ensemble approach markedly enhanced the performance of pointwise LLM rankers.

### RIS-Assisted Passive Localization (RAPL): An Efficient Zero-Overhead   Framework Using Conditional Sample Mean
**Authors**: Jiawei Yao, Yijie Mao, Mingzhe Chen, Ye Hu

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:50:31Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising solution for enhancing localization accuracy. Traditional RIS-based localization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning, and pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy and computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base station (BS) and the RIS. To address these challenges, in this work, we move beyond conventional methods and introduce a novel data-driven, multiple RISs-assisted passive localization approach (RAPL). The proposed method includes two stages, the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the user is estimated by using the conditional sample mean in the first stage, and then the user's position is determined based on the estimated multiple AoD pairs in the second stage. This approach only utilizes the existing communication signals between the user and the BS, relying solely on the measurement of received signal power at each BS antenna for a set of randomly generated phase shifts across all RISs. Moreover, by obviating the need for real-time RIS phase shift optimization or user-to-BS pilot transmissions, the method introduces no additional communication overhead, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-world networks. The proposed scheme is then extended to multi-RIS scenarios considering both parallel and cascaded RIS topologies. Numerical results show that the proposed RAPL improves localization accuracy while significantly reducing energy and signaling overhead compared to conventional methods.

### Hardware-Friendly Static Quantization Method for Video Diffusion   Transformers
**Authors**: Sanghyun Yi, Qingfeng Liu, Mostafa El-Khamy

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:17:19Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.

**Summary**: The widespread deployment of general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems introduces significant new risks. Yet the infrastructure, practices, and norms for reporting flaws in GPAI systems remain seriously underdeveloped, lagging far behind more established fields like software security. Based on a collaboration between experts from the fields of software security, machine learning, law, social science, and policy, we identify key gaps in the evaluation and reporting of flaws in GPAI systems. We call for three interventions to advance system safety. First, we propose using standardized AI flaw reports and rules of engagement for researchers in order to ease the process of submitting, reproducing, and triaging flaws in GPAI systems. Second, we propose GPAI system providers adopt broadly-scoped flaw disclosure programs, borrowing from bug bounties, with legal safe harbors to protect researchers. Third, we advocate for the development of improved infrastructure to coordinate distribution of flaw reports across the many stakeholders who may be impacted. These interventions are increasingly urgent, as evidenced by the prevalence of jailbreaks and other flaws that can transfer across different providers' GPAI systems. By promoting robust reporting and coordination in the AI ecosystem, these proposals could significantly improve the safety, security, and accountability of GPAI systems.

### Think Carefully and Check Again! Meta-Generation Unlocking LLMs for   Low-Resource Cross-Lingual Summarization
**Authors**: Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Naifan Cheung, Nanyun Peng, Kai-wei Chang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:11:24Z

**Summary**: Cross-lingual summarization (CLS) aims to generate a summary for the source text in a different target language. Currently, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at various English tasks. However, unlike languages such as English, Chinese or Spanish, for those relatively low-resource languages with limited usage or data, recent studies have shown that LLMs' performance on CLS tasks remains unsatisfactory even with few-shot settings. This raises the question: Are LLMs capable of handling cross-lingual summarization tasks for low-resource languages? To resolve this question, we fully explore the potential of large language models on cross-lingual summarization task for low-resource languages through our four-step zero-shot method: Summarization, Improvement, Translation and Refinement (SITR) with correspondingly designed prompts. We test our proposed method with multiple LLMs on two well-known cross-lingual summarization datasets with various low-resource target languages. The results show that: i) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 significantly and consistently outperform other baselines when using our zero-shot SITR methods. ii) By employing our proposed method, we unlock the potential of LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle cross-lingual summarization tasks for relatively low-resource languages.

### DRS: Deep Question Reformulation With Structured Output
**Authors**: Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:10:39Z

**Summary**: Question answering represents a core capability of large language models (LLMs). However, when individuals encounter unfamiliar knowledge in texts, they often formulate questions that the text itself cannot answer due to insufficient understanding of the underlying information. Recent studies reveal that while LLMs can detect unanswerable questions, they struggle to assist users in reformulating these questions. Even advanced models like GPT-3.5 demonstrate limited effectiveness in this regard. To address this limitation, we propose DRS: Deep Question Reformulation with Structured Output, a novel zero-shot method aimed at enhancing LLMs ability to assist users in reformulating questions to extract relevant information from new documents. DRS combines the strengths of LLMs with a DFS-based algorithm to iteratively explore potential entity combinations and constrain outputs using predefined entities. This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation capabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DRS improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42%, while also enhancing the performance of open-source models, such as Gemma2-9B, from 26.35% to 56.75%.

### Vulnerability of LLMs to Vertically Aligned Text Manipulations
**Authors**: Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Zhen Xiong, Nanyun Peng, Kai-wei Chang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:09:53Z

**Summary**: Text classification involves categorizing a given text, such as determining its sentiment or identifying harmful content. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), these models have become highly effective at performing text classification tasks. However, they still show vulnerabilities to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but few-shot learning with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices.

### QUAD: Quantization and Parameter-Efficient Tuning of LLM with Activation   Decomposition
**Authors**: Yuxuan Hu, Xiaodong Chen, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:03:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications but suffer inefficiency due to massive scale. While quantization reduces computational costs, existing methods degrade accuracy in medium-sized LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B) due to activation outliers. To address this, we propose QUAD (Quantization with Activation Decomposition), a framework leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to suppress activation outliers for effective 4-bit quantization. QUAD estimates activation singular vectors offline using calibration data to construct an orthogonal transformation matrix P, shifting outliers to additional dimensions in full precision while quantizing rest components to 4-bit. Additionally, QUAD enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning via adaptable full-precision outlier weights, narrowing the accuracy gap between quantized and full-precision models. Experiments demonstrate that QUAD achieves 94% ~ 96% accuracy under W4A4 quantization and 98% accuracy with W4A4/A8 and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 models. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/hyx1999/Quad}{repository}.

### Multi-Object Sketch Animation by Scene Decomposition and Motion Planning
**Authors**: Jingyu Liu, Zijie Xin, Yuhan Fu, Ruixiang Zhao, Bangxiang Lan, Xirong Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T05:00:11Z

**Summary**: Sketch animation, which brings static sketches to life by generating dynamic video sequences, has found widespread applications in GIF design, cartoon production, and daily entertainment. While current sketch animation methods perform well in single-object sketch animation, they struggle in multi-object scenarios. By analyzing their failures, we summarize two challenges of transitioning from single-object to multi-object sketch animation: object-aware motion modeling and complex motion optimization. For multi-object sketch animation, we propose MoSketch based on iterative optimization through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), without any other data for training. We propose four modules: LLM-based scene decomposition, LLM-based motion planning, motion refinement network and compositional SDS, to tackle the two challenges in a divide-and-conquer strategy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing sketch animation approaches. MoSketch takes a pioneering step towards multi-object sketch animation, opening new avenues for future research and applications. The code will be released.

### Language Models May Verbatim Complete Text They Were Not Explicitly   Trained On
**Authors**: Ken Ziyu Liu, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Peter Kairouz, Sanmi Koyejo, Percy Liang, Nicolas Papernot

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T04:43:33Z

**Summary**: An important question today is whether a given text was used to train a large language model (LLM). A \emph{completion} test is often employed: check if the LLM completes a sufficiently complex text. This, however, requires a ground-truth definition of membership; most commonly, it is defined as a member based on the $n$-gram overlap between the target text and any text in the dataset. In this work, we demonstrate that this $n$-gram based membership definition can be effectively gamed. We study scenarios where sequences are \emph{non-members} for a given $n$ and we find that completion tests still succeed. We find many natural cases of this phenomenon by retraining LLMs from scratch after removing all training samples that were completed; these cases include exact duplicates, near-duplicates, and even short overlaps. They showcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of $n$ for membership definitions. Using these insights, we design adversarial datasets that can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it, for any reasonable choice of $n$. Our findings highlight the inadequacy of $n$-gram membership, suggesting membership definitions fail to account for auxiliary information available to the training algorithm.

**Summary**: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation, cost-effective gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band by more than one order of magnitude.

### Membership Inference Attacks on Large-Scale Models: A Survey
**Authors**: Hengyu Wu, Yang Cao

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T04:11:47Z

**Summary**: The adoption of the Large Language Model (LLM) has accelerated dramatically since the ChatGPT from OpenAI went online in November 2022. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which process diverse data types and enable interaction through various channels, have expanded beyond the text-to-text limitations of early LLMs, attracting significant and concurrent attention from both researchers and industry. While LLMs and LMMs are starting to spread widely, concerns about their privacy risks are increasing as well. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), techniques used to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model's training set, serve as a key metric for assessing the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning models. Hu et al. show that various machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to MIA. Despite extensive studies on MIAs in traditional models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and implications in modern large-scale models like LLMs and LMMs. In this paper, we systematically reviewed recent studies of MIA against LLMs and LMMs. We analyzed and categorized each attack based on their methodology and scenario and discussed the limitations in existing research. Additionally, we examine privacy concerns associated with the fine-tuning process. Finally, we provided some suggestions for future research in this direction.

### LVFace: Progressive Cluster Optimization for Large Vision Models in Face   Recognition
**Authors**: Jinghan You, Shanglin Li, Yuanrui Sun, Jiangchuan Wei, Mingyu Guo, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T03:43:57Z

**Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized large-scale visual modeling, yet remain underexplored in face recognition (FR) where CNNs still dominate. We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints. LVFace establishes a new state-of-the-art face recognition baseline, surpassing leading approaches such as UniFace and TopoFR across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVFace delivers consistent performance gains, while exhibiting scalability to large-scale datasets and compatibility with mainstream VLMs and LLMs. Notably, LVFace secured 1st place in the ICCV 2021 Masked Face Recognition (MFR)-Ongoing Challenge (March 2025), proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

### Process or Result? Manipulated Ending Tokens Can Mislead Reasoning LLMs   to Ignore the Correct Reasoning Steps
**Authors**: Yu Cui, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Yiwei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T03:43:11Z

**Summary**: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in mathematical reasoning capabilities through long Chain-of-Thought. The reasoning tokens of these models enable self-correction within reasoning chains, enhancing robustness. This motivates our exploration: how vulnerable are reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input reasoning chains? We introduce "Compromising Thought" (CPT), a vulnerability where models presented with reasoning tokens containing manipulated calculation results tend to ignore correct reasoning steps and adopt incorrect results instead. Through systematic evaluation across multiple reasoning LLMs, we design three increasingly explicit prompting methods to measure CPT resistance, revealing that models struggle significantly to identify and correct these manipulations. Notably, contrary to existing research suggesting structural alterations affect model performance more than content modifications, we find that local ending token manipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural changes. Moreover, we discover a security vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1 where tampered reasoning tokens can trigger complete reasoning cessation. Our work enhances understanding of reasoning robustness and highlights security considerations for reasoning-intensive applications.

### Coverage-based Fairness in Multi-document Summarization
**Authors**: Haoyuan Li, Yusen Zhang, Rui Zhang, Snigdha Chaturvedi

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T03:19:51Z

**Summary**: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) measures whether a system can generate a summary fairly representing information from documents with different social attribute values. Fairness in MDS is crucial since a fair summary can offer readers a comprehensive view. Previous works focus on quantifying summary-level fairness using Proportional Representation, a fairness measure based on Statistical Parity. However, Proportional Representation does not consider redundancy in input documents and overlooks corpus-level unfairness. In this work, we propose a new summary-level fairness measure, Equal Coverage, which is based on coverage of documents with different social attribute values and considers the redundancy within documents. To detect the corpus-level unfairness, we propose a new corpus-level measure, Coverage Parity. Our human evaluations show that our measures align more with our definition of fairness. Using our measures, we evaluate the fairness of thirteen different LLMs. We find that Claude3-sonnet is the fairest among all evaluated LLMs. We also find that almost all LLMs overrepresent different social attribute values. The code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairness.

### ImageGen-CoT: Enhancing Text-to-Image In-context Learning with   Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiaqi Liao, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Dianqi Li, Kevin Lin, Yu Cheng, Lijuan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T03:18:46Z

**Summary**: In this work, we study the problem of Text-to-Image In-Context Learning (T2I-ICL). While Unified Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, they struggle with contextual reasoning in T2I-ICL scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates a thought process called ImageGen-CoT prior to image generation. To avoid generating unstructured ineffective reasoning steps, we develop an automatic pipeline to curate a high-quality ImageGen-CoT dataset. We then fine-tune MLLMs using this dataset to enhance their contextual reasoning capabilities. To further enhance performance, we explore test-time scale-up strategies and propose a novel hybrid scaling approach. This approach first generates multiple ImageGen-CoT chains and then produces multiple images for each chain via sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, fine-tuning with the ImageGen-CoT dataset leads to a substantial 80\% performance gain for SEED-X on T2I-ICL tasks. See our project page at https://ImageGen-CoT.github.io/. Code and model weights will be open-sourced.

### Iterative Hypothesis Generation for Scientific Discovery with Monte   Carlo Nash Equilibrium Self-Refining Trees
**Authors**: Gollam Rabby, Diyana Muhammed, Prasenjit Mitra, Sören Auer

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T03:14:53Z

**Summary**: Scientific hypothesis generation is a fundamentally challenging task in research, requiring the synthesis of novel and empirically grounded insights. Traditional approaches rely on human intuition and domain expertise, while purely large language model (LLM) based methods often struggle to produce hypotheses that are both innovative and reliable. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Nash Equilibrium Self-Refine Tree (MC-NEST), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Nash Equilibrium strategies to iteratively refine and validate hypotheses. MC-NEST dynamically balances exploration and exploitation through adaptive sampling strategies, which prioritize high-potential hypotheses while maintaining diversity in the search space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MC-NEST through comprehensive experiments across multiple domains, including biomedicine, social science, and computer science. MC-NEST achieves average scores of 2.65, 2.74, and 2.80 (on a 1-3 scale) for novelty, clarity, significance, and verifiability metrics on the social science, computer science, and biomedicine datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art prompt-based methods, which achieve 2.36, 2.51, and 2.52 on the same datasets. These results underscore MC-NEST's ability to generate high-quality, empirically grounded hypotheses across diverse domains. Furthermore, MC-NEST facilitates structured human-AI collaboration, ensuring that LLMs augment human creativity rather than replace it. By addressing key challenges such as iterative refinement and the exploration-exploitation balance, MC-NEST sets a new benchmark in automated hypothesis generation. Additionally, MC-NEST's ethical design enables responsible AI use, emphasizing transparency and human supervision in hypothesis generation.

### AMD-Hummingbird: Towards an Efficient Text-to-Video Model
**Authors**: Takashi Isobe, He Cui, Dong Zhou, Mengmeng Ge, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T02:43:16Z

**Summary**: Text-to-Video (T2V) generation has attracted significant attention for its ability to synthesize realistic videos from textual descriptions. However, existing models struggle to balance computational efficiency and high visual quality, particularly on resource-limited devices, e.g.,iGPUs and mobile phones. Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need for smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed Hummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through visual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4 billion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while preserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel data processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and video data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we publicly release the full training code, including data processing and model training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup compared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining the highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the generation of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of existing U-Net-based methods in long video generation. Notably, the entire training process requires only four GPUs, yet delivers performance competitive with existing leading methods. Hummingbird presents a practical and efficient solution for T2V generation, combining high performance, scalability, and flexibility for real-world applications.
