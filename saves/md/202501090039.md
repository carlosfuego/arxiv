 ### Follow The Approximate Sparse Leader for No-Regret Online Sparse Linear   Approximation
**Authors**: Samrat Mukhopadhyay, Debasmita Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:32:19Z

**Summary**: We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.

### Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks   for AI generated text detection
**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:00:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

**Authors**: Ziyang Men, Zheqi Shen, Yan Gu, Yihan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T23:16:22Z

**Summary**: The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

**Authors**: Suwei Wang, Lile Wang, Subo Dong

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T19:00:03Z

**Summary**: With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (>~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.

### Direct Comparison of Magnetic Penetration Depth in Kagome   Superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb)
**Authors**: Austin Kaczmarek, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Katja C. Nowack

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T15:59:23Z

**Summary**: We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

### Enhancing Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding with Cache Mechanism
**Authors**: Yimin Tang, Zhenghong Yu, Yi Zheng, T. K. Satish Kumar, Jiaoyang Li, Sven Koenig

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T06:44:13Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial in autonomous warehouse operations. Lifelong MAPF (L-MAPF), where agents are continuously reassigned new targets upon completing their current tasks, offers a more realistic approximation of real-world warehouse scenarios. While cache storage systems can enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs, existing approaches primarily rely on expectations and mathematical models, often without adequately addressing the challenges of multi-robot planning and execution. In this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism called Lifelong MAPF with Cache Mechanism (L-MAPF-CM), which integrates high-level cache storage with low-level path planning. We have involved a new type of map grid called cache for temporary item storage. Additionally, we involved a task assigner (TA) with a locking mechanism to bridge the gap between the new cache grid and L-MAPF algorithm. The TA dynamically allocates target locations to agents based on their status in various scenarios. We evaluated L-MAPF-CM using different cache replacement policies and task distributions. L-MAPF-CM has demonstrated performance improvements particularly with high cache hit rates and smooth traffic conditions.

### From Slow Bidirectional to Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tianwei Yin, Qiang Zhang, Richard Zhang, William T. Freeman, Fredo Durand, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T01:26:42Z

**Summary**: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

### ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2025-01-05T14:11:48Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

**Authors**: Yaohui Wang, Zicong Wang, Fanfeng Meng, Yanjing Wang, Yang Ou, Lizhou Wu, Wentao Hong, Xuran Ge, Jijun Cao

**Updated**: 2025-01-05T12:51:08Z

**Summary**: Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a promising technology for memory disaggregation and expansion. Especially, CXL makes it more effectively for large-capacity storage devices such as Solid State Drive (SSD) to be deployed in the memory pool. However, CXL-based SSDs are still in early stages, necessitating the development of reliable simulation tools. In this paper, we propose CXL-SSD-Sim, the first open-source full-system simulator designed to simulate CXL-based SSD memory system. Constructed on the foundation of gem5 and SimpleSSD, CXL-SSD-Sim extends an high fidelity SSD memory expander model along with the corresponding device driver. In addition, CXL-SSD-Sim models a DRAM layer as a caching mechanism for the SSD, meticulously engineered to counteract latency issues inherent to CXL-based SSD memory access. Experiments are performed among five different memory devices with CXL-SSD-Sim in aspect of latency, bandwidth and real-world benchmark performance. These experiments serve to underscore the efficacy of our simulation tool in providing a comprehensive analysis of CXL-based SSD memory systems. The CXL-SSD-Sim simulator is available at https://github.com/WangYaohuii/CXL-SSD-Sim.

### LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas   and Ad-Hoc Networks
**Authors**: Atonu Ghosh, Sudip Misra

**Updated**: 2025-01-05T07:41:53Z

**Summary**: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

### Reciprocating Locks
**Authors**: Dave Dice, Alex Kogan

**Updated**: 2025-01-04T20:59:34Z

**Summary**: We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

### End-to-End Long Document Summarization using Gradient Caching
**Authors**: Rohit Saxena, Hao Tang, Frank Keller

**Updated**: 2025-01-03T13:32:57Z

**Summary**: Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.

### Efficient LLM Inference with Activation Checkpointing and Hybrid Caching
**Authors**: Sanghyeon Lee, Hongbeen Kim, Soojin Hwang, Guseul Heo, Minwoo Noh, Jaehyuk Huh

**Updated**: 2025-01-03T12:51:37Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) with enormous model sizes use many GPUs to meet memory capacity requirements incurring substantial costs for token generation. To provide cost-effective LLM inference with relaxed latency constraints, extensive research has focused on expanding GPU memory by leveraging the host memory. However, LLM inference engines that utilize the host memory often face underutilization of GPU compute units, as a considerable portion of inference time is spent in loading the model onto the GPU via host-GPU interconnect. To tackle these challenges of the host memory offloading for LLM, we introduce HybridServe, an LLM inference system with activation checkpointing based on activation caching. The activation cache stores activation checkpoints generated during intermediate inference stages, allowing the fast recomputation of KV cache while model parameters are transferred to GPU from host memory. Unlike conventional methods that recompute the KV cache from scratch using token IDs, the activation cache allows bypassing projection and FFN operations. To balance between the activation recomputation and parameter loading overhead, this study proposes a KV-activation hybrid caching scheme which finds the best ratio of the key-value and activation caches to adjust the recomputation time. Our system achieves 2.19x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art prior work for offloading both model weights and KV cache.

### Object-level Visual Prompts for Compositional Image Generation
**Authors**: Gaurav Parmar, Or Patashnik, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Daniil Ostashev, Srinivasa Narasimhan, Jun-Yan Zhu, Daniel Cohen-Or, Kfir Aberman

**Updated**: 2025-01-02T18:59:44Z

**Summary**: We introduce a method for composing object-level visual prompts within a text-to-image diffusion model. Our approach addresses the task of generating semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness. Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the creative potential of text-to-image generation.

### MSWA: Refining Local Attention with Multi-ScaleWindow Attention
**Authors**: Yixing Xu, Shivank Nag, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-01-02T03:41:32Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based LLMs have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-02T03:40:15Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

**Authors**: Zihao Ye, Lequn Chen, Ruihang Lai, Wuwei Lin, Yineng Zhang, Stephanie Wang, Tianqi Chen, Baris Kasikci, Vinod Grover, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Luis Ceze

**Updated**: 2025-01-02T02:02:20Z

**Summary**: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

### Cached Adaptive Token Merging: Dynamic Token Reduction and Redundant   Computation Elimination in Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Omid Saghatchian, Atiyeh Gh. Moghadam, Ahmad Nickabadi

**Updated**: 2025-01-01T20:16:27Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for generating high-quality, high-dimensional images. Nevertheless, these models are hindered by their high computational cost and slow inference, partly due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention mechanisms with respect to input size. Various approaches have been proposed to address this drawback. One such approach focuses on reducing the number of tokens fed into the self-attention, known as token merging (ToMe). In our method, which is called cached adaptive token merging(CA-ToMe), we calculate the similarity between tokens and then merge the r proportion of the most similar tokens. However, due to the repetitive patterns observed in adjacent steps and the variation in the frequency of similarities, we aim to enhance this approach by implementing an adaptive threshold for merging tokens and adding a caching mechanism that stores similar pairs across several adjacent steps. Empirical results demonstrate that our method operates as a training-free acceleration method, achieving a speedup factor of 1.24 in the denoising process while maintaining the same FID scores compared to existing approaches.

### EdgeRAG: Online-Indexed RAG for Edge Devices
**Authors**: Korakit Seemakhupt, Sihang Liu, Samira Khan

**Updated**: 2024-12-31T20:40:43Z

**Summary**: Deploying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to limited memory and processing power. In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.

### Token Pruning for Caching Better: 9 Times Acceleration on Stable   Diffusion for Free
**Authors**: Evelyn Zhang, Bang Xiao, Jiayi Tang, Qianli Ma, Chang Zou, Xuefei Ning, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-31T09:56:40Z

**Summary**: Stable Diffusion has achieved remarkable success in the field of text-to-image generation, with its powerful generative capabilities and diverse generation results making a lasting impact. However, its iterative denoising introduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting broader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this computational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention due to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features computed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to become similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately compromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a dynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of feature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing only high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby extending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with token pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise information reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach delivered a 9$\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced image quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\times$ acceleration coupled with a notable FID reduction of 2.17.

**Summary**: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-31T05:24:30Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

### Cross-Layer Cache Aggregation for Token Reduction in Ultra-Fine-Grained   Image Recognition
**Authors**: Edwin Arkel Rios, Jansen Christopher Yuanda, Vincent Leon Ghanz, Cheng-Wei Yu, Bo-Cheng Lai, Min-Chun Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-31T03:19:38Z

**Summary**: Ultra-fine-grained image recognition (UFGIR) is a challenging task that involves classifying images within a macro-category. While traditional FGIR deals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying sub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times the usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain outstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a significant cost in terms of computation specially since this task significantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images. Therefore, techniques such as token reduction have emerged to reduce the computational cost. However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for fine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced. Therefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token reduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a Cross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous layers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs across diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction methods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy vs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to 10\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:33:19Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:54:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### A Hidden Quantum Paraelectric Phase in SrTiO3 Induced by Terahertz Field
**Authors**: Wei Li, Hanbyul Kim, Xinbo Wang, Jianlin Luo, Simone Latini, Dongbin Shin, Jun-Ming Liu, Jing-Feng Li, Angel Rubio, Ce-Wen Nan, Qian Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:54:19Z

**Summary**: Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:01:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.

### Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for   Converting MHA to GQA
**Authors**: Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:05:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.

### Dynamic Optimization of Storage Systems Using Reinforcement Learning   Techniques
**Authors**: Chiyu Cheng, Chang Zhou, Yang Zhao, Jin Cao

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T17:41:40Z

**Summary**: The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1]. The proposed framework operates within the storage kernel, ensuring minimal latency and low computational overhead. Through an adaptive feedback mechanism, RL-Storage dynamically adjusts critical parameters, achieving efficient resource utilization across a wide range of workloads. Experimental evaluations conducted on a range of benchmarks, including RocksDB and PostgreSQL, demonstrate significant improvements, with throughput gains of up to 2.6x and latency reductions of 43% compared to baseline heuristics. Additionally, RL-Storage achieves these performance enhancements with a negligible CPU overhead of 0.11% and a memory footprint of only 5 KB, making it suitable for seamless deployment in production environments. This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.

### Ns3 meets Sionna: Using Realistic Channels in Network Simulation
**Authors**: Anatolij Zubow, Yannik Pilz, Sascha Rösler, Falko Dressler

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T17:18:21Z

**Summary**: Network simulators are indispensable tools for the advancement of wireless network technologies, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment to simulate real-world network behavior. However, traditional simulators, such as the widely used ns-3, exhibit limitations in accurately modeling indoor and outdoor scenarios due to their reliance on simplified statistical and stochastic channel propagation models, which often fail to accurately capture physical phenomena like multipath signal propagation and shadowing by obstacles in the line-of-sight path. We present Ns3Sionna, which integrates a ray tracing-based channel model, implemented using the Sionna RT framework, within the ns-3 network simulator. It allows to simulate environment-specific and physically accurate channel realizations for a given 3D scene and wireless device positions. Additionally, a mobility model based on ray tracing was developed to accurately represent device movements within the simulated 3D space. Ns3Sionna provides more realistic path and delay loss estimates for both indoor and outdoor environments than existing ns-3 propagation models, particularly in terms of spatial and temporal correlation. Moreover, fine-grained channel state information is provided, which could be used for the development of sensing applications. Due to the significant computational demands of ray tracing, Ns3Sionna takes advantage of the parallel execution capabilities of modern GPUs and multi-core CPUs by incorporating intelligent pre-caching mechanisms that leverage the channel's coherence time to optimize runtime performance. This enables the efficient simulation of scenarios with a small to medium number of mobile nodes.

### Revisiting Cache Freshness for Emerging Real-Time Applications
**Authors**: Ziming Mao, Rishabh Iyer, Scott Shenker, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T17:17:03Z

**Summary**: Caching is widely used in industry to improve application performance by reducing data-access latency and taking the load off the backend infrastructure. TTLs have become the de-facto mechanism used to keep cached data reasonably fresh (i.e., not too out of date with the backend). However, the emergence of real-time applications requires tighter data freshness, which is impractical to achieve with TTLs. We discuss why this is the case, and propose a simple yet effective adaptive policy to achieve the desired freshness.

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T14:38:16Z

**Summary**: The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters presents significant challenges to computational resources, particularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which process sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand on the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache sizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) maximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the memory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to accelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and the inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory management. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM architecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software co-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited across a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA for PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in efficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We developed an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based compiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while the hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for long-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems (up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

### ST$^3$: Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Model by Spatial-Temporal   Visual Token Trimming
**Authors**: Jiedong Zhuang, Lu Lu, Ming Dai, Rui Hu, Jian Chen, Qiang Liu, Haoji Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T10:17:29Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance their perceptual capabilities by integrating visual and textual information. However, processing the massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost. Existing analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to coarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed and accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM attention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and partial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based on this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming ($\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without retraining. $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1) Progressive Visual Token Pruning (\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive visual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\textbf{VTA}), which dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the generated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around $\mathbf{2\times}$ faster inference with only about $\mathbf{30\%}$ KV cache memory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance across various datasets. Crucially, $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained MLLMs, providing a plug-and-play solution for efficient inference.

### A Robust Federated Learning Framework for Undependable Devices at Scale
**Authors**: Shilong Wang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Chunming Qiao, Huarong Deng, Qiuye Zheng, Jiantao Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T03:28:52Z

**Summary**: In a federated learning (FL) system, many devices, such as smartphones, are often undependable (e.g., frequently disconnected from WiFi) during training. Existing FL frameworks always assume a dependable environment and exclude undependable devices from training, leading to poor model performance and resource wastage. In this paper, we propose FLUDE to effectively deal with undependable environments. First, FLUDE assesses the dependability of devices based on the probability distribution of their historical behaviors (e.g., the likelihood of successfully completing training). Based on this assessment, FLUDE adaptively selects devices with high dependability for training. To mitigate resource wastage during the training phase, FLUDE maintains a model cache on each device, aiming to preserve the latest training state for later use in case local training on an undependable device is interrupted. Moreover, FLUDE proposes a staleness-aware strategy to judiciously distribute the global model to a subset of devices, thus significantly reducing resource wastage while maintaining model performance. We have implemented FLUDE on two physical platforms with 120 smartphones and NVIDIA Jetson devices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLUDE can effectively improve model performance and resource efficiency of FL training in undependable environments.

### Multi-matrix Factorization Attention
**Authors**: Jingcheng Hu, Houyi Li, Yinmin Zhang, Zili Wang, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, Heung-Yeung Shum

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:45:45Z

**Summary**: We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

### Performance Characterization and Optimizations of Traditional ML   Applications
**Authors**: Harsh Kumar, R. Govindarajan

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T04:13:52Z

**Summary**: Even in the era of Deep Learning based methods, traditional machine learning methods with large data sets continue to attract significant attention. However, we find an apparent lack of a detailed performance characterization of these methods in the context of large training datasets. In this work, we study the system's behavior of a number of traditional ML methods as implemented in popular free software libraries/modules to identify critical performance bottlenecks experienced by these applications. The performance characterization study reveals several interesting insights on the performance of these applications. Then we evaluate the performance benefits of applying some well-known optimizations at the levels of caches and the main memory. More specifically, we test the usefulness of optimizations such as (i) software prefetching to improve cache performance and (ii) data layout and computation reordering optimizations to improve locality in DRAM accesses. These optimizations are implemented as modifications to the well-known scikit-learn library, and hence can be easily leveraged by application programmers. We evaluate the impact of the proposed optimizations using a combination of simulation and execution on a real system. The software prefetching optimization results in performance benefits varying from 5.2%-27.1% on different ML applications while the data layout and computation reordering approaches yield 6.16%-28.0% performance improvement.

### XRFlux: Virtual Reality Benchmark for Edge Caching Systems
**Authors**: Nader Alfares, George Kesidis

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T18:36:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce a Unity based benchmark XRFlux for evaluating Virtual Reality (VR) delivery systems using edge-cloud caching. As VR applications and systems progress, the need to meet strict latency and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements is increasingly evident. In the context of VR, traditional cloud architectures (e.g., remote AWS S3 for content delivery) often struggle to meet these demands, especially for users of the same application in different locations. With edge computing, resources are brought closer to users in efforts to reduce latency and improve QoEs. However, VR's dynamic nature, with changing fields of view (FoVs) and user synchronization requirements, creates various challenges for edge caching. We address the lack of suitable benchmarks and propose a framework that simulates multiuser VR scenarios while logging users' interaction with objects within their actual and predicted FoVs. The benchmark's activity log can then be played back through an edge cache to assess the resulting QoEs. This tool fills a gap by supporting research in the optimization of edge caching (and other edge-cloud functions) for VR streaming.

### Long-Range Tasks Using Short-Context LLMs: Incremental Reasoning With   Structured Memories
**Authors**: Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T14:14:31Z

**Summary**: Long-range tasks require reasoning over long inputs. Existing solutions either need large compute budgets, training data, access to model weights, or use complex, task-specific approaches. We present PRISM, which alleviates these concerns by processing information as a stream of chunks, maintaining a structured in-context memory specified by a typed hierarchy schema. This approach demonstrates superior performance to baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x smaller contexts than long-context models. Moreover, PRISM is token-efficient. By producing short outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches, it achieves up to 54% cost reduction when compared to alternative short-context approaches. The method also scales down to tiny information chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) without increasing the number of tokens encoded or sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generate schemas to generalize our approach to new tasks with minimal effort.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Dual Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Evelyn Zhang, Runlin Guo, Haohang Xu, Conghui He, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T14:00:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

### Aspect-oriented Programming with Julia
**Authors**: Osamu Ishimura, Yoshihide Yoshimoto

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T11:59:17Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes integrating Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) into Julia, a language widely used in scientific and High-Performance Computing (HPC). AOP enhances software modularity by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and parallelizing, into separate, reusable aspects. Leveraging Julia's powerful metaprogramming and abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation capabilities, we introduce AspectJulia, an AOP framework designed to operate within Julia's runtime environment as a package.

### HashEvict: A Pre-Attention KV Cache Eviction Strategy using   Locality-Sensitive Hashing
**Authors**: Minghui Liu, Tahseen Rabbani, Tony O'Halloran, Ananth Sankaralingam, Mary-Anne Hartley, Brian Gravelle, Furong Huang, Cornelia Fermüller, Yiannis Aloimonos

**Updated**: 2024-12-24T13:04:45Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-24T00:46:00Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation
**Authors**: Luyang Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Jiaxing Wu, Jun Xie, Arthur Szlam

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T18:02:25Z

**Summary**: Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

### A Reproducible Method for Mapping Electricity Transmission   Infrastructure for Space Weather Risk Assessment
**Authors**: Edward J. Oughton, Evan Alexander Peters, Dennies Bor, Noah Rivera, C. Trevor Gaunt, Robert Weigel

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T16:11:18Z

**Summary**: Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.

### Inter-Satellite Link-Enhanced Transmission Scheme Towards Aviation IoT   in SAGIN
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Chenyu Wu, Shuai Han, Weixiao Meng, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T14:40:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of the aviation Internet of Things (IoT) has positioned in-flight connectivity (IFC) as one of its critical applications. Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are essential for ensuring the performance of IFC by enabling seamless and reliable connectivity. However, most existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes and overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates. In this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground stations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers, thereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached (instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only through GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery process for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached files, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite association scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and GS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving the way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.

### A Framework for Effective Invocation Methods of Various LLM Services
**Authors**: Can Wang, Dianbo Sui, Bolin Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Jiabao Kang, Zhidong Qiao, Zhiying Tu

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T12:55:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in solving various natural language processing tasks and are now widely offered as services. LLM services enable users to accomplish tasks without requiring specialized knowledge, simply by paying service providers. However, numerous providers offer various LLM services with variations in pricing, latency, and performance. These factors are also affected by different invocation methods, such as the choice of context and the use of cache, which lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable service cost and quality. Consequently, utilizing various LLM services invocation methods to construct an effective (cost-saving, low-latency and high-performance) invocation strategy that best meets task demands becomes a pressing challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of methods help LLM services to be invoked efficiently. Technically, we define the problem of constructing an effective LLM services invocation strategy, and based on this, propose a unified LLM service invocation framework. The framework classifies existing methods into four categories: input abstraction, semantic cache, solution design, and output enhancement, which can be used separately or jointly during the invocation life cycle. We discuss the methods in each category and compare them to provide valuable guidance for researchers. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges in this domain and shed light on future research.

### CALLIC: Content Adaptive Learning for Lossless Image Compression
**Authors**: Daxin Li, Yuanchao Bai, Kai Wang, Junjun Jiang, Xianming Liu, Wen Gao

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T10:41:18Z

**Summary**: Learned lossless image compression has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on training amortized generative models on massive datasets, resulting in sub-optimal probability distribution estimation for specific testing images during encoding process. To address this challenge, we explore the connection between the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), leading to the development of a novel content-adaptive approach for learned lossless image compression, dubbed CALLIC. Specifically, we first propose a content-aware autoregressive self-attention mechanism by leveraging convolutional gating operations, termed Masked Gated ConvFormer (MGCF), and pretrain MGCF on training dataset. Cache then Crop Inference (CCI) is proposed to accelerate the coding process. During encoding, we decompose pre-trained layers, including depth-wise convolutions, using low-rank matrices and then adapt the incremental weights on testing image by Rate-guided Progressive Fine-Tuning (RPFT). RPFT fine-tunes with gradually increasing patches that are sorted in descending order by estimated entropy, optimizing learning process and reducing adaptation time. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that CALLIC sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for learned lossless image compression.

### Fast and Live Model Auto Scaling with O(1) Host Caching
**Authors**: Dingyan Zhang, Haotian Wang, Yang Liu, Xingda Wei, Yizhou Shan, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T03:38:46Z

**Summary**: Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. We first show that data plane can be made fast with no/O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable host cache and is underutilized; (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled instance with cooperative execution, thus handles cases even when the compute network is not sufficiently fast. Our system BLITZSCALE reduces the serving tail latencies by up to 86% without caching, and we achieve comparable performance (or even better) to an optimal setup where all the parameters are cached at all the host for autoscaling.

### Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shanti Stewart, Gouthaman KV, Lie Lu, Andrea Fanelli

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T02:52:36Z

**Summary**: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

### Agile TLB Prefetching and Prediction Replacement Policy
**Authors**: Melkamu Mersha, Tsion Abay, Mingziem Bitewa, Gedare Bloom

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T00:46:53Z

**Summary**: Virtual-to-physical address translation is a critical performance bottleneck in paging-based virtual memory systems. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) accelerates address translation by caching frequently accessed mappings, but TLB misses lead to costly page walks. Hardware and software techniques address this challenge. Hardware approaches enhance TLB reach through system-level support, while software optimizations include TLB prefetching, replacement policies, superpages, and page size adjustments. Prefetching Page Table Entries (PTEs) for future accesses reduces bottlenecks but may incur overhead from incorrect predictions. Integrating an Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP) with SBFP optimizes performance by leveraging page table locality and dynamically identifying essential free PTEs during page walks. Predictive replacement policies further improve TLB performance. Traditional LRU replacement is limited to near-instant references, while advanced policies like SRRIP, GHRP, SHiP, SDBP, and CHiRP enhance performance by targeting specific inefficiencies. CHiRP, tailored for L2 TLBs, surpasses other policies by leveraging control flow history to detect dead blocks, utilizing L2 TLB entries for learning instead of sampling. These integrated techniques collectively address key challenges in virtual memory management.

### MVREC: A General Few-shot Defect Classification Model Using Multi-View   Region-Context
**Authors**: Shuai Lyu, Fangjian Liao, Zeqi Ma, Rongchen Zhang, Dongmei Mo, Waikeung Wong

**Updated**: 2024-12-22T07:14:45Z

**Summary**: Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

**Authors**: Cunchen Hu, Heyang Huang, Junhao Hu, Jiang Xu, Xusheng Chen, Tao Xie, Chenxi Wang, Sa Wang, Yungang Bao, Ninghui Sun, Yizhou Shan

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T13:55:49Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) serving has transformed from stateless to stateful systems, utilizing techniques like context caching and disaggregated inference. These optimizations extend the lifespan and domain of the KV cache, necessitating a new architectural approach. We present MemServe, a unified system that integrates both inter-request and intra-request optimizations. MemServe introduces MemPool, an elastic memory pool managing distributed memory and KV caches across serving instances. Using MemPool APIs, MemServe combines context caching with disaggregated inference for the first time, supported by a global scheduler that enhances cache reuse through a global prompt tree-based locality-aware policy. Tests show that MemServe significantly improves job completion time and time-to-first-time.

### Parameterized Complexity of Caching in Networks
**Authors**: Robert Ganian, Fionn Mc Inerney, Dimitra Tsigkari

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T11:20:26Z

**Summary**: The fundamental caching problem in networks asks to find an allocation of contents to a network of caches with the aim of maximizing the cache hit rate. Despite the problem's importance to a variety of research areas -- including not only content delivery, but also edge intelligence and inference -- and the extensive body of work on empirical aspects of caching, very little is known about the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem beyond its general NP-hardness. We close this gap by performing a comprehensive complexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise statements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity. Our results include algorithmic lower and upper bounds which together establish the conditions under which the caching problem becomes tractable.

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T02:36:03Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### SYMPHONY: Improving Memory Management for LLM Inference Workloads
**Authors**: Saurabh Agarwal, Anyong Mao, Aditya Akella, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T01:48:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in applications such as chatbots, code editors, and conversational agents. A key feature of LLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or external tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a multi-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the key-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction. Existing serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to main memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of processed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from GPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across the cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY leverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints that allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By utilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable finegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that SYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with a similar latency profile.

### Multi-Strided Access Patterns to Boost Hardware Prefetching
**Authors**: Miguel O. Blom, Kristian F. D. Rietveld, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T15:51:42Z

**Summary**: Important memory-bound kernels, such as linear algebra, convolutions, and stencils, rely on SIMD instructions as well as optimizations targeting improved vectorized data traversal and data re-use to attain satisfactory performance. On on temporary CPU architectures, the hardware prefetcher is of key importance for efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single stride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the utilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of memory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we establish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache lines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache hit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of costly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided variants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform state-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More specifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution Stencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to 12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and 1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided memory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange techniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in the future.

### Towards Projected and Incremental Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting
**Authors**: Suwei Yang, Kuldeep S. Meel

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T15:18:44Z

**Summary**: Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption. In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.

### Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for   Knowledge Tasks
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T06:58:32Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Yuyang Huang, Jiayi Yao, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Hanchen Li, Yihua Cheng, Junchen Jiang, Shan Lu, Madan Musuvathi, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T23:52:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.   Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. Jiménez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T22:34:37Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context   LLMs
**Authors**: Xiabin Zhou, Wenbin Wang, Minyan Zeng, Jiaxian Guo, Xuebo Liu, Li Shen, Min Zhang, Liang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T13:28:42Z

**Summary**: Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T12:38:23Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### Nemesis: Noise-randomized Encryption with Modular Efficiency and Secure   Integration in Machine Learning Systems
**Authors**: Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T22:52:12Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.

### ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with   Low-Rank Residuals
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Sayeh Sharify, Kaushik Roy, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T22:01:55Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline. Code is available at https://github.com/utkarsh-dmx/project-resq.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T21:09:08Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation
**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T17:36:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG.

### Rehearsal-Free Continual Federated Learning with Synergistic   Regularization
**Authors**: Yichen Li, Yuying Wang, Tianzhe Xiao, Haozhao Wang, Yining Qi, Ruixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T12:16:41Z

**Summary**: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Semantic Convergence: Harmonizing Recommender Systems via Two-Stage   Alignment and Behavioral Semantic Tokenization
**Authors**: Guanghan Li, Xun Zhang, Yufei Zhang, Yifan Yin, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T12:07:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities, are adept at discerning profound user interests from historical behaviors, thereby presenting a promising avenue for the advancement of recommendation systems. However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T09:47:25Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### SCOPE: Optimizing Key-Value Cache Compression in Long-context Generation
**Authors**: Jialong Wu, Zhenglin Wang, Linhai Zhang, Yilong Lai, Yulan He, Deyu Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T09:27:33Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T07:45:11Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3$\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\times$, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

### Vivar: A Generative AR System for Intuitive Multi-Modal Sensor Data   Presentation
**Authors**: Yunqi Guo, Kaiyuan Hou, Heming Fu, Hongkai Chen, Zhenyu Yan, Guoliang Xing, Xiaofan Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T05:16:11Z

**Summary**: Understanding sensor data can be challenging for non-experts because of the complexity and unique semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This calls for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 485 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

### Boosting Long-Context Management via Query-Guided Activation Refilling
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Zhicheng Dou, Defu Lian

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T05:08:39Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.   In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaosheng Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T14:45:12Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### Efficient Diffusion Transformer Policies with Mixture of Expert   Denoisers for Multitask Learning
**Authors**: Moritz Reuss, Jyothish Pari, Pulkit Agrawal, Rudolf Lioutikov

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T14:34:51Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while using 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies. Code and demonstrations are available at https://mbreuss.github.io/MoDE_Diffusion_Policy/.

### ZoRI: Towards Discriminative Zero-Shot Remote Sensing Instance   Segmentation
**Authors**: Shiqi Huang, Shuting He, Bihan Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T11:00:56Z

**Summary**: Instance segmentation algorithms in remote sensing are typically based on conventional methods, limiting their application to seen scenarios and closed-set predictions. In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuangShiqi128/ZoRI.

### More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision   Trade-off in KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T09:20:31Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension and seldom explore the efficiency of their combination. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision, i.e., quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. Furthermore, in-depth analysis regarding token-precision trade-off from a series of key aspects exhibit that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Moreover, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings provide valuable insights into the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. We plan to release our code in the near future.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T09:11:47Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### TurboAttention: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs   LLMs
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T05:40:09Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

### Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous   Edge Content Caching Networks
**Authors**: Zhen Li, Tan Li, Hai Liu, Tse-Tin Chan

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T05:09:45Z

**Summary**: Proactive caching is essential for minimizing latency and improving Quality of Experience (QoE) in multi-server edge networks. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) is a promising approach for developing cache policies tailored to dynamic content requests. However, FDRL faces challenges such as an expanding caching action space due to increased content numbers and difficulty in adapting global information to heterogeneous edge environments. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Caching, called PF-DRL-Ca, with the aim to maximize system utility while satisfying caching capability constraints. To manage the expanding action space, we employ a new DRL algorithm, Multi-head Deep Q-Network (MH-DQN), which reshapes the action output layers of DQN into a multi-head structure where each head generates a sub-dimensional action. We next integrate the proposed MH-DQN into a personalized federated training framework, employing a layer-wise approach for training to derive a personalized model that can adapt to heterogeneous environments while exploiting the global information to accelerate learning convergence. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MH-DQN over traditional DRL algorithms on a single server, as well as the advantages of the personal federated training architecture compared to other frameworks.

**Authors**: Hongyi Jin, Ruihang Lai, Charlie F. Ruan, Yingcheng Wang, Todd C. Mowry, Xupeng Miao, Zhihao Jia, Tianqi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T02:44:43Z

**Summary**: The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.

**Authors**: Xuan Shen, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou, Bo Chen, Yanyu Li, Yifan Gong, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Jason Kuen, Henghui Ding, Zhihao Shu, Wei Niu, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang, Jiuxiang Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T01:12:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency.

### The Selection Problem in Multi-Query Optimization: a Comprehensive   Survey
**Authors**: Sergey Zinchenko, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:49:32Z

**Summary**: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.

### CSR:Achieving 1 Bit Key-Value Cache via Sparse Representation
**Authors**: Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:01:53Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

### AsymRnR: Video Diffusion Transformers Acceleration with Asymmetric   Reduction and Restoration
**Authors**: Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Zhao Jin, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:28:22Z

**Summary**: Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.

### Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite   Pixel Learning
**Authors**: Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:55:26Z

**Summary**: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

### The "Huh?" Button: Improving Understanding in Educational Videos with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T21:02:16Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple way to use large language models (LLMs) in education. Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.

### PULSE: Accelerating Distributed Pointer-Traversals on Disaggregated   Memory (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yupeng Tang, Seung-seob Lee, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Anurag Khandelwal

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T03:29:54Z

**Summary**: Caches at CPU nodes in disaggregated memory architectures amortize the high data access latency over the network. However, such caches are fundamentally unable to improve performance for workloads requiring pointer traversals across linked data structures. We argue for accelerating these pointer traversals closer to disaggregated memory in a manner that preserves expressiveness for supporting various linked structures, ensures energy efficiency and performance, and supports distributed execution. We design PULSE, a distributed pointer-traversal framework for rack-scale disaggregated memory to meet all the above requirements. Our evaluation of PULSE shows that it enables low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient execution for a wide range of pointer traversal workloads on disaggregated memory that fare poorly with caching alone.

### SparseMap: Loop Mapping for Sparse CNNs on Streaming Coarse-grained   Reconfigurable Array
**Authors**: Xiaobing Ni, Mengke Ge, Jiaheng Ruan, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T02:30:09Z

**Summary**: Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising architecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its fexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when accelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs would cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal dependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the streaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming CGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with operation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby ensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show SparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even smaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.

### Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Derrick Quinn, Mohammad Nouri, Neel Patel, John Salihu, Alireza Salemi, Sukhan Lee, Hamed Zamani, Mohammad Alian

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T06:47:56Z

**Summary**: An evolving solution to address hallucination and enhance accuracy in large language models (LLMs) is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves augmenting LLMs with information retrieved from an external knowledge source, such as the web. This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.   In this work, we design Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a type-2 CXL device that implements a scale-out near-memory acceleration architecture with a novel cache-coherent interface between the host CPU and near-memory accelerators. IKS offers 13.4-27.9x faster exact nearest neighbor search over a 512GB vector database compared with executing the search on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. This higher search performance translates to 1.7-26.3x lower end-to-end inference time for representative RAG applications. IKS is inherently a memory expander; its internal DRAM can be disaggregated and used for other applications running on the server to prevent DRAM, which is the most expensive component in today's servers, from being stranded.

### RMCSA Algorithm for Congestion-Aware and Service Latency Aware Dynamic   Service Provisioning in Software-Defined SDM-EONs
**Authors**: Baljinder Singh Heera, Shrinivas Petale, Yatindra Nath Singh, Suresh Subramaniam

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T05:20:50Z

**Summary**: The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the utilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit minimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in optical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic and congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads to service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network, restricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available algorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer a trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus increasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic routing-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum assignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on real-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion under dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the formation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness centrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network topologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant RMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's K-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection blocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the route-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to the recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA algorithm.

### SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods
**Authors**: Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Chengruidong Zhang, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Jianfeng Gao, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:37:48Z

**Summary**: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models. Codes and pre-trained models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T16:13:39Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:11:42Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

### Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority   Queues
**Authors**: Thore Thießen, Jan Vahrenhold

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:08:55Z

**Summary**: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

### Activation Sparsity Opportunities for Compressing General Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Nobel Dhar, Bobin Deng, Md Romyull Islam, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Liang Zhao, Kun Suo

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T02:26:54Z

**Summary**: Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

**Authors**: Md Nurul Absur, Sourya Saha, Sifat Nawrin Nova, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Md Rahat Ul Nasib

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T17:20:26Z

**Summary**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

### Unifying AI Tutor Evaluation: An Evaluation Taxonomy for Pedagogical   Ability Assessment of LLM-Powered AI Tutors
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T16:24:35Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T15:39:48Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

 ### Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of   Images and Videos
**Authors**: Haobo Yuan, Xiangtai Li, Tao Zhang, Zilong Huang, Shilin Xu, Shunping Ji, Yunhai Tong, Lu Qi, Jiashi Feng, Ming-Hsuan Yang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:58:54Z

**Summary**: This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.

### RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation   Performance
**Authors**: Matin Mortaheb, Mohammad A. Amir Khojastepour, Srimat T. Chakradhar, Sennur Ulukus

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:52:05Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.

### NeuralSVG: An Implicit Representation for Text-to-Vector Generation
**Authors**: Sagi Polaczek, Yuval Alaluf, Elad Richardson, Yael Vinker, Daniel Cohen-Or

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:50:06Z

**Summary**: Vector graphics are essential in design, providing artists with a versatile medium for creating resolution-independent and highly editable visual content. Recent advancements in vision-language and diffusion models have fueled interest in text-to-vector graphics generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from over-parameterized outputs or treat the layered structure - a core feature of vector graphics - as a secondary goal, diminishing their practical use. Recognizing the importance of layered SVG representations, we propose NeuralSVG, an implicit neural representation for generating vector graphics from text prompts. Inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), NeuralSVG encodes the entire scene into the weights of a small MLP network, optimized using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To encourage a layered structure in the generated SVG, we introduce a dropout-based regularization technique that strengthens the standalone meaning of each shape. We additionally demonstrate that utilizing a neural representation provides an added benefit of inference-time control, enabling users to dynamically adapt the generated SVG based on user-provided inputs, all with a single learned representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that NeuralSVG outperforms existing methods in generating structured and flexible SVG.

### Influences on LLM Calibration: A Study of Response Agreement, Loss   Functions, and Prompt Styles
**Authors**: Yuxi Xia, Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Klim Zaporojets, Benjamin Roth

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:48:42Z

**Summary**: Calibration, the alignment between model confidence and prediction accuracy, is critical for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.

### (De)-Indexing and the Right to be Forgotten
**Authors**: Salvatore Vilella, Giancarlo Ruffo

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:46:34Z

**Summary**: In the digital age, the challenge of forgetfulness has emerged as a significant concern, particularly regarding the management of personal data and its accessibility online. The right to be forgotten (RTBF) allows individuals to request the removal of outdated or harmful information from public access, yet implementing this right poses substantial technical difficulties for search engines. This paper aims to introduce non-experts to the foundational concepts of information retrieval (IR) and de-indexing, which are critical for understanding how search engines can effectively "forget" certain content. We will explore various IR models, including boolean, probabilistic, vector space, and embedding-based approaches, as well as the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing data processing capabilities. By providing this overview, we seek to highlight the complexities involved in balancing individual privacy rights with the operational challenges faced by search engines in managing information visibility.

### Sequentializing a Test: Anytime Validity is Free
**Authors**: Nick W. Koning, Sam van Meer

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:39:28Z

**Summary**: An anytime valid sequential test permits us to peek at observations as they arrive. This means we can stop, continue or adapt the testing process based on the current data, without invalidating the inference. Given a maximum number of observations $N$, one may believe that this benefit must be paid for in terms of power when compared to a conventional test that waits until all $N$ observations have arrived. Our key contribution is to show that this is false: for any valid test based on $N$ observations, we derive an anytime valid sequential test that matches it after $N$ observations. In addition, we show that the value of the sequential test before a rejection is attained can be directly used as a significance level for a subsequent test. We illustrate this for the $z$-test. There, we find that the current state-of-the-art based on log-optimal $e$-values can be obtained as a special limiting case that replicates a $z$-test with level $\alpha \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$.

### Intelligent Router for LLM Workloads: Improving Performance Through   Workload-Aware Load Balancing

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:16:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) workloads have distinct prefill and decode phases with different compute and memory requirements which should ideally be accounted for when scheduling input queries across different LLM instances in a cluster. However existing scheduling algorithms treat LLM workloads as monolithic jobs without considering the distinct characteristics of the two phases in each workload. This leads to sub-optimal scheduling and increased response latency. In this work, we start by characterizing factors affecting the response latency during LLM inference serving. We establish that better load balancing of inference requests across the available LLM instances can improve the end-to-end latency to a larger extent than merely focusing on optimizing the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by our findings, we propose a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for data-driven and workload-aware scheduling. Our router schedules queries across LLM instances by leveraging a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads and achieves over 11% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches on a mix of public datasets and 7.8% lower end-to-end latency on real workload data with diverse input and output trends from Cloud Provider X. Additionally, the proposed framework can also serve as a standard for benchmarking different LLM inference schedulers since it provides the best latency for a given model, hardware, and instance-level scheduler combination.

### VLM-driven Behavior Tree for Context-aware Task Planning
**Authors**: Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Jun Takamatsu, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Katsushi Ikeuchi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:06:27Z

**Summary**: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Behavior Trees (BTs) has recently gained attention in the robotics community, yet remains in its early stages of development. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its feasibility and limitations.

### Vision Language Models as Values Detectors
**Authors**: Giulio Antonio Abbo, Tony Belpaeme

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:37:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models integrating textual and visual inputs have introduced new possibilities for interpreting complex data. Despite their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on visual stimuli, the alignment of these models with human perception in identifying relevant elements in images requires further exploration. This paper investigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators in detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We created a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and enlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image. We then compared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, including GPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree of alignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoring low. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential to detect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved training and refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeper insights and more contextually relevant responses.

### Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Luiz F. O. Chamon, Mohammad Reza Karimi, Anna Korba

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:36:14Z

**Summary**: This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.

### AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient   Attention Manipulation
**Authors**: Björn Deiseroth, Mayukh Deb, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:26:26Z

**Summary**: Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.

### Localizing AI: Evaluating Open-Weight Language Models for Languages of   Baltic States
**Authors**: Jurgita Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė, Toms Bergmanis, Mārcis Pinnis

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:24:17Z

**Summary**: Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation. The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages. Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs.

### Scalable calibration for partially observed individual-based epidemic   models through categorical approximations
**Authors**: Lorenzo Rimella, Nick Whiteley, Chris Jewell, Paul Fearnhead, Michael Whitehouse

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:19:05Z

**Summary**: The computational cost of exact likelihood evaluation for partially observed and highly-heterogeneous individual-based models grows exponentially with the population size, therefore inference relies on approximations. Sampling-based approaches to this problem such as Sequential Monte Carlo or Approximate Bayesian Computation usually require simulation of every individual in the population multiple times and are heavily reliant on the design of bespoke proposal distributions or summary statistics, and can still scale poorly with population size. To overcome this, we propose a deterministic recursive approach to approximating the likelihood function using categorical distributions. The resulting algorithm has a computational cost as low as linear in the population size and is amenable to automatic differentiation, leading to simple algorithms for maximizing this approximate likelihood or sampling from posterior distributions. We prove consistency of the maximum approximate likelihood estimator of model parameters. We empirically test our approach on a range of models with various flavors of heterogeneity: different sets of disease states, individual-specific susceptibility and infectivity, spatial interaction mechanisms, under-reporting and mis-reporting. We demonstrate strong calibration performance, in terms of log-likelihood variance and ground truth recovery, and computational advantages over competitor methods. We conclude by illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world large-scale application using Foot-and-Mouth data from the 2001 outbreak in the United Kingdom.

### Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks   for AI generated text detection
**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:00:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

### Scaling Efficient LLMs
**Authors**: B. N. Kausik

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:58:05Z

**Summary**: Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale more than four fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.44}$; (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.

### Estimates of the reproduction ratio from epidemic surveillance may be   biased in spatially structured populations
**Authors**: Piero Birello, Michele Re Fiorentin, Boxuan Wang, Vittoria Colizza, Eugenio Valdano

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:55:39Z

**Summary**: Accurate estimates of the reproduction ratio are crucial to project infectious disease epidemic evolution and guide public health response. Here, we prove that estimates of the reproduction ratio based on inference from surveillance data can be inaccurate if the population comprises spatially distinct communities, as the space-mobility interplay may hide the true epidemic evolution from surveillance data. Consequently, surveillance may underestimate the reproduction ratio over long periods, even mistaking growing epidemics as subsiding. To address this, we use the spectral properties of the matrix describing the spatial epidemic spread to reweigh surveillance data. We propose a correction that removes the bias across all epidemic phases. We validate this correction against simulated epidemics and use COVID-19 as a case study. However, our results apply to any epidemic where mobility is a driver of circulation. Our findings will help improve epidemic monitoring and surveillance and inform strategies for public health response.

### Information Extraction from Clinical Notes: Are We Ready to Switch to   Large Language Models?
**Authors**: Yan Hu, Xu Zuo, Yujia Zhou, Xueqing Peng, Jimin Huang, Vipina K. Keloth, Vincent J. Zhang, Ruey-Ling Weng, Qingyu Chen, Xiaoqian Jiang, Kirk E. Roberts, Hua Xu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:48:36Z

**Summary**: Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

### Optimal Estimation of Temperature
**Authors**: Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:43:51Z

**Summary**: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.

### Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear   Simulation-based Inference
**Authors**: Nicolas Mediato-Diaz, Will Handley

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:34:47Z

**Summary**: We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.

### Active Learning Techniques for Pomset Recognizers
**Authors**: Adrien Pommellet, Amazigh Amrane, Edgar Delaporte

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:28:49Z

**Summary**: Pomsets are a promising formalism for concurrent programs based on partially ordered sets. Among this class, series-parallel pomsets admit a convenient linear representation and can be recognized by simple algebraic structures known as pomset recognizers. Active learning consists in inferring a formal model of a recognizable language by asking membership and equivalence queries to a minimally adequate teacher (MAT). We improve existing learning algorithms for pomset recognizers by 1. introducing a new counter-example analysis procedure that is in the best case scenario exponentially more efficient than existing methods 2. adapting the state-of-the-art $L^{\lambda}$ algorithm to minimize the impact of exceedingly verbose counter-examples and remove redundant queries 3. designing a suitable finite test suite that ensures general equivalence between two pomset recognizers by extending the well-known W-method.

### Implicit Coordination using Active Epistemic Inference
**Authors**: Lauren Bramblett, Jonathan Reasoner, Nicola Bezzo

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:22:12Z

**Summary**: A Multi-robot system (MRS) provides significant advantages for intricate tasks such as environmental monitoring, underwater inspections, and space missions. However, addressing potential communication failures or the lack of communication infrastructure in these fields remains a challenge. A significant portion of MRS research presumes that the system can maintain communication with proximity constraints, but this approach does not solve situations where communication is either non-existent, unreliable, or poses a security risk. Some approaches tackle this issue using predictions about other robots while not communicating, but these methods generally only permit agents to utilize first-order reasoning, which involves reasoning based purely on their own observations. In contrast, to deal with this problem, our proposed framework utilizes Theory of Mind (ToM), employing higher-order reasoning by shifting a robot's perspective to reason about a belief of others observations. Our approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic systems.

### T-FREE: Subword Tokenizer-Free Generative LLMs via Sparse   Representations for Memory-Efficient Embeddings
**Authors**: Björn Deiseroth, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Samuel Weinbach

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:20:17Z

**Summary**: Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses. Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.   To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.

**Authors**: Ramya Jonnala, Gongbo Liang, Jeong Yang, Izzat Alsmadi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:18:55Z

**Summary**: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into public transit systems presents a transformative opportunity to enhance urban mobility. This study explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times, and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential. San Antonio serves as a case study to inform the development of LLM-powered transit systems in other urban environments.

### Finer: Investigating and Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Concept   Recognition in Large Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Jeonghwan Kim, Heng Ji

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:05:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.

### LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One   Vision Token
**Authors**: Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Zhe Yang, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:03:14Z

**Summary**: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.

### LEAP: LLM-powered End-to-end Automatic Library for Processing Social   Science Queries on Unstructured Data
**Authors**: Chuxuan Hu, Austin Peters, Daniel Kang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:00:40Z

**Summary**: Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present. Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data. However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers. Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited. To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML. LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations. LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries. LEAP achieves a 100% pass @ 3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.

### AlphaPO -- Reward shape matters for LLM alignment
**Authors**: Aman Gupta, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Sirou Zhu, Jiwoo Hong, Ankan Saha, Viral Gupta, Noah Lee, Eunki Kim, Jason Zhu, Natesh Pillai, S. Sathiya Keerthi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:46:42Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made huge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is skipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being learned. Examples include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responses are often reduced undesirably.   In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce AlphaPO, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter to help change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and over-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO leads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance for the instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B. The analysis and results presented highlight the importance of the reward shape, and how one can systematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improve alignment performance.

### CL3DOR: Contrastive Learning for 3D Large Multimodal Models via Odds   Ratio on High-Resolution Point Clouds
**Authors**: Keonwoo Kim, Yeongjae Cho, Taebaek Hwang, Minsoo Jo, Sangdo Han

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:42:32Z

**Summary**: Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to text-only tasks but can also function as multimodal models across various modalities, including audio, images, and videos. In particular, research on 3D Large Multimodal Models (3D LMMs) is making notable strides, driven by the potential of processing higher-dimensional data like point clouds. However, upon closer examination, we find that the visual and textual content within each sample of existing training datasets lacks both high informational granularity and clarity, which serve as a bottleneck for precise cross-modal understanding. To address these issues, we propose CL3DOR, Contrastive Learning for 3D large multimodal models via Odds ratio on high-Resolution point clouds, designed to ensure greater specificity and clarity in both visual and textual content. Specifically, we increase the density of point clouds per object and construct informative hard negative responses in the training dataset to penalize unwanted responses. To leverage hard negative responses, we incorporate the odds ratio as an auxiliary term for contrastive learning into the conventional language modeling loss. CL3DOR achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CL3DOR's key components through extensive experiments.

### ZDySS -- Zero-Shot Dynamic Scene Stylization using Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Abhishek Saroha, Florian Hofherr, Mariia Gladkova, Cecilia Curreli, Or Litany, Daniel Cremers

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:39:02Z

**Summary**: Stylizing a dynamic scene based on an exemplar image is critical for various real-world applications, including gaming, filmmaking, and augmented and virtual reality. However, achieving consistent stylization across both spatial and temporal dimensions remains a significant challenge. Most existing methods are designed for static scenes and often require an optimization process for each style image, limiting their adaptability. We introduce ZDySS, a zero-shot stylization framework for dynamic scenes, allowing our model to generalize to previously unseen style images at inference. Our approach employs Gaussian splatting for scene representation, linking each Gaussian to a learned feature vector that renders a feature map for any given view and timestamp. By applying style transfer on the learned feature vectors instead of the rendered feature map, we enhance spatio-temporal consistency across frames. Our method demonstrates superior performance and coherence over state-of-the-art baselines in tests on real-world dynamic scenes, making it a robust solution for practical applications.

### LLaVA Steering: Visual Instruction Tuning with 500x Fewer Parameters   through Modality Linear Representation-Steering
**Authors**: Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:36:54Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.

### Helping LLMs Improve Code Generation Using Feedback from Testing and   Static Analysis
**Authors**: Greta Dolcetti, Vincenzo Arceri, Eleonora Iotti, Sergio Maffeis, Agostino Cortesi, Enea Zaffanella

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:30:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence, and the software engineering community has readily noticed their potential role in the software development life-cycle. Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing productivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness, and security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream commercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static analysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code generated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.   First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks. Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the generated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety vulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated code, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the models ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during the static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.   Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.

### Lived Experience Not Found: LLMs Struggle to Align with Experts on   Addressing Adverse Drug Reactions from Psychiatric Medication Use
**Authors**: Mohit Chandra, Siddharth Sriraman, Gaurav Verma, Harneet Singh Khanuja, Jose Suarez Campayo, Zihang Li, Michael L. Birnbaum, Munmun De Choudhury

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:30:02Z

**Summary**: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among mental health patients. With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.

### Progressive Document-level Text Simplification via Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dengzhao Fang, Jipeng Qiang, Yi Zhu, Yunhao Yuan, Wei Li, Yan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:14:37Z

**Summary**: Research on text simplification has primarily focused on lexical and sentence-level changes. Long document-level simplification (DS) is still relatively unexplored. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have excelled in many natural language processing tasks. However, their performance on DS tasks is unsatisfactory, as they often treat DS as merely document summarization. For the DS task, the generated long sequences not only must maintain consistency with the original document throughout, but complete moderate simplification operations encompassing discourses, sentences, and word-level simplifications. Human editors employ a hierarchical complexity simplification strategy to simplify documents. This study delves into simulating this strategy through the utilization of a multi-stage collaboration using LLMs. We propose a progressive simplification method (ProgDS) by hierarchically decomposing the task, including the discourse-level, topic-level, and lexical-level simplification. Experimental results demonstrate that ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models or direct prompting with LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art in the document simplification task.

### Hallucination Detox: Sensitivity Dropout (SenD) for Large Language Model   Training
**Authors**: Shahrad Mohammadzadeh, Juan David Guerra, Marco Bonizzato, Reihaneh Rabbany, Golnoosh Farnadi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:56:42Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.

### TACLR: A Scalable and Efficient Retrieval-based Method for Industrial   Product Attribute Value Identification
**Authors**: Yindu Su, Huike Zou, Lin Sun, Ting Zhang, Haiyang Yang, Liyu Chen, David Lo, Qingheng Zhang, Shuguang Han, Jufeng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:45:30Z

**Summary**: Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendations, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity to the item embedding. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial scenarios. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Moreover, it has been successfully deployed in a real-world e-commerce platform, processing millions of product listings daily while supporting dynamic, large-scale attribute taxonomies.

### On Local Overfitting and Forgetting in Deep Neural Networks
**Authors**: Uri Stern, Tomer Yaacoby, Daphna Weinshall

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:45:04Z

**Summary**: The infrequent occurrence of overfitting in deep neural networks is perplexing: contrary to theoretical expectations, increasing model size often enhances performance in practice. But what if overfitting does occur, though restricted to specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we propose a novel score that captures the forgetting rate of deep models on validation data. We posit that this score quantifies local overfitting: a decline in performance confined to certain regions of the data space. We then show empirically that local overfitting occurs regardless of the presence of traditional overfitting. Using the framework of deep over-parametrized linear models, we offer a certain theoretical characterization of forgotten knowledge, and show that it correlates with knowledge forgotten by real deep models. Finally, we devise a new ensemble method that aims to recover forgotten knowledge, relying solely on the training history of a single network. When combined with self-distillation, this method enhances the performance of any trained model without adding inference costs. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method across multiple datasets, contemporary neural network architectures, and training protocols.

### Deep Sylvester Posterior Inference for Adaptive Compressed Sensing in   Ultrasound Imaging
**Authors**: Simon W. Penninga, Hans van Gorp, Ruud J. G. van Sloun

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:37:14Z

**Summary**: Ultrasound images are commonly formed by sequential acquisition of beam-steered scan-lines. Minimizing the number of required scan-lines can significantly enhance frame rate, field of view, energy efficiency, and data transfer speeds. Existing approaches typically use static subsampling schemes in combination with sparsity-based or, more recently, deep-learning-based recovery. In this work, we introduce an adaptive subsampling method that maximizes intrinsic information gain in-situ, employing a Sylvester Normalizing Flow encoder to infer an approximate Bayesian posterior under partial observation in real-time. Using the Bayesian posterior and a deep generative model for future observations, we determine the subsampling scheme that maximizes the mutual information between the subsampled observations, and the next frame of the video. We evaluate our approach using the EchoNet cardiac ultrasound video dataset and demonstrate that our active sampling method outperforms competitive baselines, including uniform and variable-density random sampling, as well as equidistantly spaced scan-lines, improving mean absolute reconstruction error by 15%. Moreover, posterior inference and the sampling scheme generation are performed in just 0.015 seconds (66Hz), making it fast enough for real-time 2D ultrasound imaging applications.

### Reconstructing ecological community dynamics from limited observations
**Authors**: Chandler Ross, Ville Laitinen, Moein Khalighi, Jarkko Salojärvi, Willem de Vos, Guilhem Sommeria-Klein, Leo Lahti

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:35:03Z

**Summary**: Ecosystems tend to fluctuate around stable equilibria in response to internal dynamics and environmental factors. Occasionally, they enter an unstable tipping region and collapse into an alternative stable state. Our understanding of how ecological communities vary over time and respond to perturbations depends on our ability to quantify and predict these dynamics. However, the scarcity of long, dense time series data poses a severe bottleneck for characterising community dynamics using existing methods. We overcome this limitation by combining information across multiple short time series using Bayesian inference. By decomposing dynamics into deterministic and stochastic components using Gaussian process priors, we predict stable and tipping regions along the community landscape and quantify resilience while addressing uncertainty. After validation with simulated and real ecological time series, we use the model to question common assumptions underlying classical potential analysis and re-evaluate the stability of previously proposed "tipping elements" in the human gut microbiota.

### High-cadence stellar variability studies of RR Lyrae stars with DECam:   New multi-band templates

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:25:53Z

**Summary**: We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.

### Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times
**Authors**: Rick Bebon, Aljaz Godec

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:23:07Z

**Summary**: First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Theoretical approaches so far primarily focused on predicting first-passage statistics for a given process or model. In practice, however, one faces the reverse problem of inferring first-passage statistics from, typically sub-sampled, experimental or simulation data. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task, and the assessment of the uncertainty is imperative. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first-passage times of reversible Markov processes. Precisely, we present concentration inequalities bounding from above the deviations of the sample mean for any sample size from the true mean first-passage time and construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals. Moreover, we present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e, deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is a priori not a sufficient statistic.

### GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet   Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Qiwei Zhu, Kai Li, Guojing Zhang, Xiaoying Wang, Jianqiang Huang, Xilai Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:19:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR reconstruction by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose Wavelet Loss, a loss function that effectively captures high-frequency detail information in images, thereby enhancing the visual quality of SR, particularly in terms of detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including AID, AID_CDM, RSSRD-QH, and RSSRD-QH_CDM, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.05 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 2.9 times faster. Furthermore, the Wavelet Loss shows excellent generalization across various architectures, providing a novel perspective for RSI-SR enhancement.

**Authors**: Jie Cao, Dian Jiao, Qiang Yan, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:09:22Z

**Summary**: Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to produce summaries that answer particular questions of interest, enabling greater user control and personalization. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), shows their impressive capability of textual understanding through large-scale pretraining, which implies the great potential of extractive snippet generation. In this paper, we systematically investigated two indispensable characteristics that the LLMs-based QFS models should be harnessed, Lengthy Document Summarization and Efficiently Fine-grained Query-LLM Alignment, respectively. Correspondingly, we propose two modules called Query-aware HyperExpert and Query-focused Infini-attention to access the aforementioned characteristics. These innovations pave the way for broader application and accessibility in the field of QFS technology. Extensive experiments conducted on existing QFS benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/IDEAL_Summary.

### Sketch-MoMa: Teleoperation for Mobile Manipulator via Interpretation of   Hand-Drawn Sketches
**Authors**: Kosei Tanada, Yuka Iwanaga, Masayoshi Tsuchinaga, Yuji Nakamura, Takemitsu Mori, Remi Sakai, Takashi Yamamoto

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:41:26Z

**Summary**: To use assistive robots in everyday life, a remote control system with common devices, such as 2D devices, is helpful to control the robots anytime and anywhere as intended. Hand-drawn sketches are one of the intuitive ways to control robots with 2D devices. However, since similar sketches have different intentions from scene to scene, existing work needs additional modalities to set the sketches' semantics. This requires complex operations for users and leads to decreasing usability. In this paper, we propose Sketch-MoMa, a teleoperation system using the user-given hand-drawn sketches as instructions to control a robot. We use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the user-given sketches superimposed on an observation image and infer drawn shapes and low-level tasks of the robot. We utilize the sketches and the generated shapes for recognition and motion planning of the generated low-level tasks for precise and intuitive operations. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art VLMs with 7 tasks and 5 sketch shapes. We also demonstrate that our approach effectively specifies the detailed motions, such as how to grasp and how much to rotate. Moreover, we show the competitive usability of our approach compared with the existing 2D interface through a user experiment with 14 participants.

### NesTools: A Dataset for Evaluating Nested Tool Learning Abilities of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Han Han, Tong Zhu, Xiang Zhang, Mengsong Wu, Hao Xiong, Wenliang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:34:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.

### Transdimensional inference for gravitational-wave astronomy with Bilby
**Authors**: Hui Tong, Nir Guttman, Teagan A. Clarke, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane, Ethan Payne, Rowina Nathan, Ben Farr, Maya Fishbach, Gregory Ashton, Valentina Di Marco

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:31:23Z

**Summary**: It has become increasingly useful to answer questions in gravitational-wave astronomy using transdimensional models where the number of free parameters can be varied depending on the complexity required to fit the data. Given the growing interest in transdimensional inference, we introduce a new package for the Bayesian inference Library (Bilby) called tBilby. The tBilby package allows users to set up transdimensional inference calculations using the existing Bilby architecture with off-the-shelf nested samplers and/or Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Transdimensional models are particularly helpful when we seek to test theoretically uncertain predictions described by phenomenological models. For example, bursts of gravitational waves can be modelled using a superposition of N wavelets where N is itself a free parameter. Short pulses are modelled with small values of N whereas longer, more complicated signals are represented with a large number of wavelets stitched together. Other transdimensional models have found use describing instrumental noise and the population properties of gravitational-wave sources. We provide a few demonstrations of tBilby, including fitting the gravitational-wave signal GW150914 with a superposition of N sine-Gaussian wavelets. We outline our plans to further develop the tbilby code suite for a broader range of transdimensional problems.

### AllSpark: A Multimodal Spatio-Temporal General Intelligence Model with   Ten Modalities via Language as a Reference Framework
**Authors**: Run Shao, Cheng Yang, Qiujun Li, Qing Zhu, Yongjun Zhang, YanSheng Li, Yu Liu, Yong Tang, Dapeng Liu, Shizhong Yang, Haifeng Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:31:01Z

**Summary**: Leveraging multimodal data is an inherent requirement for comprehending geographic objects. However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%. The source code is available at https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/AllSpark.

### BoRA: Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption for Multi-Task Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Simen Eide, Arnoldo Frigessi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:28:00Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.

### To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence   observationally viable?
**Authors**: George Alestas, Matilda Delgado, Ignacio Ruiz, Yashar Akrami, Miguel Montero, Savvas Nesseris

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:24:58Z

**Summary**: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k>0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here, we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.

### A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems
**Authors**: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:21:10Z

**Summary**: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. For linear scalar systems, we derive an explicit formulation of the uncertainty set. For multi-dimensional linear systems, we develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against the inference attack.

### Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit
**Authors**: Sebastian Ament, Elizabeth Santorella, David Eriksson, Ben Letham, Maximilian Balandat, Eytan Bakshy

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:04:51Z

**Summary**: Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.

### Implications of the intriguing constant inner mass surface density   observed in dark matter halos
**Authors**: Jorge Sanchez Almeida

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:03:56Z

**Summary**: It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.

### Conditions for radiative zones in the molecular hydrogen envelope of   Jupiter and Saturn: The role of alkali metals
**Authors**: Louis Siebenaler, Yamila Miguel, Sam de Regt, Tristan Guillot

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:56:31Z

**Summary**: Interior models of gas giants in the Solar System traditionally assume a fully convective molecular hydrogen envelope. However, recent observations from the Juno mission suggest a possible depletion of alkali metals in Jupiter's molecular hydrogen envelope, indicating that a stable radiative layer could exist at the kilobar level. Recent studies propose that deep stable layers help reconcile various Jupiter observations, including its atmospheric water and CO abundances and the depth of its zonal winds. However, opacity tables used to infer stable layers are often outdated and incomplete, leaving the precise molecular hydrogen envelope composition required for a deep radiative zone uncertain. In this paper, we determine atmospheric compositions that can lead to the formation of a radiative zone at the kilobar level in Jupiter and Saturn today. We computed radiative opacity tables covering pressures up to $10^5$ bar, including the most abundant molecules present in the gas giants of the Solar System, as well as contributions from free electrons, metal hydrides, oxides, and atomic species, using the most up-to-date line lists published in the literature. These tables were used to calculate Rosseland-mean opacities for the molecular hydrogen envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, which were then compared to the critical mean opacity required to maintain convection. We find that the presence of a radiative zone is controlled by the existence of K, Na, and NaH in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. For Jupiter, the elemental abundance of K and Na must be less than $\sim 10^{-3}$ times solar to form a radiative zone. In contrast, for Saturn, the required abundance for K and Na is below $\sim 10^{-4}$ times solar.

**Authors**: Shuaihang Chen, Yuanxing Liu, Wei Han, Weinan Zhang, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:48:22Z

**Summary**: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems ( LLM-MAS ) have become a research hotspot since the rise of large language models (LLMs). However, with the continuous influx of new related works, the existing reviews struggle to capture them comprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these studies. We first discuss the definition of LLM-MAS, a framework encompassing much of previous work. We provide an overview of the various applications of LLM-MAS in (i) solving complex tasks, (ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii) evaluating generative agents. Building on previous studies, we also highlight several challenges and propose future directions for research in this field.

### Continuously Learning New Words in Automatic Speech Recognition
**Authors**: Christian Huber, Alexander Waibel

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:40:58Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still far from perfect. Typical errors include acronyms, named entities, and domain-specific special words for which little or no labeled data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose a self-supervised continual learning approach: Given the audio of a lecture talk with the corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from the literature. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation data set. Continual learning is then performed by training adaptation weights added to the model on this data set. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.

### Context-Alignment: Activating and Enhancing LLM Capabilities in Time   Series
**Authors**: Yuxiao Hu, Qian Li, Dongxiao Zhang, Jinyue Yan, Yuntian Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:40:35Z

**Summary**: Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.

### A Survey on Large Language Models with Multilingualism: Recent Advances   and New Frontiers
**Authors**: Kaiyu Huang, Fengran Mo, Xinyu Zhang, Hongliang Li, You Li, Yuanchi Zhang, Weijian Yi, Yulong Mao, Jinchen Liu, Yuzhuang Xu, Jinan Xu, Jian-Yun Nie, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:15:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable multilingual capabilities in natural language processing, attracting global attention in both academia and industry. To mitigate potential discrimination and enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user groups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology. Despite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual scenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent approaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To this end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of LLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between previous and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce several perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and inference methods, information retrieval, model security, multi-domain with language culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges that arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we highlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with multilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address multilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural language processing based on LLMs.

**Authors**: Riccardo Andrea Izzo, Gianluca Bardaro, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T11:18:08Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to generating behavior trees for robots using lightweight large language models (LLMs) with a maximum of 7 billion parameters. The study demonstrates that it is possible to achieve satisfying results with compact LLMs when fine-tuned on a specific dataset. The key contributions of this research include the creation of a fine-tuning dataset based on existing behavior trees using GPT-3.5 and a comprehensive comparison of multiple LLMs (namely llama2, llama-chat, and code-llama) across nine distinct tasks. To be thorough, we evaluated the generated behavior trees using static syntactical analysis, a validation system, a simulated environment, and a real robot. Furthermore, this work opens the possibility of deploying such solutions directly on the robot, enhancing its practical applicability. Findings from this study demonstrate the potential of LLMs with a limited number of parameters in generating effective and efficient robot behaviors.

### PSA-VLM: Enhancing Vision-Language Model Safety through Progressive   Concept-Bottleneck-Driven Alignment
**Authors**: Zhendong Liu, Yuanbi Nie, Yingshui Tan, Jiaheng Liu, Xiangyu Yue, Qiushi Cui, Chongjun Wang, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T11:09:52Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.

### Motion-Aware Generative Frame Interpolation
**Authors**: Guozhen Zhang, Yuhan Zhu, Yutao Cui, Xiaotong Zhao, Kai Ma, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T11:03:43Z

**Summary**: Generative frame interpolation, empowered by large-scale pre-trained video generation models, has demonstrated remarkable advantages in complex scenes. However, existing methods heavily rely on the generative model to independently infer the correspondences between input frames, an ability that is inadequately developed during pre-training. In this work, we propose a novel framework, termed Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG), to significantly enhance the model's motion awareness by integrating explicit motion guidance. Specifically we investigate two key questions: what can serve as an effective motion guidance, and how we can seamlessly embed this guidance into the generative model. For the first question, we reveal that the intermediate flow from flow-based interpolation models could efficiently provide task-oriented motion guidance. Regarding the second, we first obtain guidance-based representations of intermediate frames by warping input frames' representations using guidance, and then integrate them into the model at both latent and feature levels. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we train MoG on both real-world and animation datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that our MoG significantly outperforms the existing methods in both domains, achieving superior video quality and improved fidelity.

### Latent Diffusion Bridges for Unsupervised Musical Audio Timbre Transfer

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:45:58Z

**Summary**: Music timbre transfer is a challenging task that involves modifying the timbral characteristics of an audio signal while preserving its melodic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.

### SLAM: Towards Efficient Multilingual Reasoning via Selective Language   Alignment
**Authors**: Yuchun Fan, Yongyu Mu, Yilin Wang, Lei Huang, Junhao Ruan, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Shujian Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:29:43Z

**Summary**: Despite the significant improvements achieved by large language models (LLMs) in English reasoning tasks, these models continue to struggle with multilingual reasoning. Recent studies leverage a full-parameter and two-stage training paradigm to teach models to first understand non-English questions and then reason. However, this method suffers from both substantial computational resource computing and catastrophic forgetting. The fundamental cause is that, with the primary goal of enhancing multilingual comprehension, an excessive number of irrelevant layers and parameters are tuned during the first stage. Given our findings that the representation learning of languages is merely conducted in lower-level layers, we propose an efficient multilingual reasoning alignment approach that precisely identifies and fine-tunes the layers responsible for handling multilingualism. Experimental results show that our method, SLAM, only tunes 6 layers' feed-forward sub-layers including 6.5-8% of all parameters within 7B and 13B LLMs, achieving superior average performance than all strong baselines across 10 languages. Meanwhile, SLAM only involves one training stage, reducing training time by 4.1-11.9 compared to the two-stage method.

### SMIR: Efficient Synthetic Data Pipeline To Improve Multi-Image Reasoning
**Authors**: Andrew Li, Rahul Thapa, Rahul Chalamala, Qingyang Wu, Kezhen Chen, James Zou

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:21:21Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in understanding single images, aided by numerous high-quality instruction datasets. However, multi-image reasoning tasks are still under-explored in the open-source community due to two main challenges: (1) scaling datasets with multiple correlated images and complex reasoning instructions is resource-intensive and maintaining quality is difficult, and (2) there is a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for multi-image tasks. To address these issues, we introduce SMIR, an efficient synthetic data-generation pipeline for multi-image reasoning, and a high-quality dataset generated using this pipeline. Our pipeline efficiently extracts highly correlated images using multimodal embeddings, combining visual and descriptive information and leverages open-source LLMs to generate quality instructions. Using this pipeline, we generated 160K synthetic training samples, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive closed-source solutions. Additionally, we present SMIR-BENCH, a novel multi-image reasoning evaluation benchmark comprising 200 diverse examples across 7 complex multi-image reasoning tasks. SMIR-BENCH is multi-turn and utilizes a VLM judge to evaluate free-form responses, providing a comprehensive assessment of model expressiveness and reasoning capability across modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMIR dataset by fine-tuning several open-source VLMs and evaluating their performance on SMIR-BENCH. Our results show that models trained on our dataset outperform baseline models in multi-image reasoning tasks up to 8% with a much more scalable data pipeline.

### Thermal Comfort in Sight: Thermal Affordance and its Visual Assessment   for Sustainable Streetscape Design
**Authors**: Sijie Yang, Adrian Chong, Pengyuan Liu, Filip Biljecki

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:09:33Z

**Summary**: In response to climate change and urban heat island effects, enhancing human thermal comfort in cities is crucial for sustainable urban development. Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalizes the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance -- VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and resilient urban environments.

**Authors**: Yannis Bendi-Ouis, Dan Dutartre, Xavier Hinaut

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:55:57Z

**Summary**: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.

### DehazeGS: Seeing Through Fog with 3D Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Jinze Yu, Yiqun Wang, Zhengda Lu, Jianwei Guo, Yong Li, Hongxing Qin, Xiaopeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:47:46Z

**Summary**: Current novel view synthesis tasks primarily rely on high-quality and clear images. However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency.

### On Doubly Robust Inference for Double Machine Learning in Semiparametric   Regression
**Authors**: Oliver Dukes, Stijn Vansteelandt, David Whitney

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:46:58Z

**Summary**: Due to concerns about parametric model misspecification, there is interest in using machine learning to adjust for confounding when evaluating the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Unfortunately, exposure effect estimators that rely on machine learning predictions are generally subject to so-called plug-in bias, which can render naive $p$-values and confidence intervals invalid. Progress has been made via proposals like targeted minimum loss estimation and more recently double machine learning, which rely on learning the conditional mean of both the outcome and exposure. Valid inference can then be obtained so long as both predictions converge (sufficiently fast) to the truth. Focusing on partially linear regression models, we show that a specific implementation of the machine learning techniques can yield exposure effect estimators that have small bias even when one of the first-stage predictions does not converge to the truth. The resulting tests and confidence intervals are doubly robust. We also show that the proposed estimators may fail to be regular when only one nuisance parameter is consistently estimated; nevertheless, we observe in simulation studies that our proposal can lead to reduced bias and improved confidence interval coverage in moderate-to-large samples.

### Forecasting Credit Ratings: A Case Study where Traditional Methods   Outperform Generative LLMs
**Authors**: Felix Drinkall, Janet B. Pierrehumbert, Stefan Zohren

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:46:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well for many downstream tasks. Transfer learning can enable LLMs to acquire skills that were not targeted during pre-training. In financial contexts, LLMs can sometimes beat well-established benchmarks. This paper investigates how well LLMs perform in the task of forecasting corporate credit ratings. We show that while LLMs are very good at encoding textual information, traditional methods are still very competitive when it comes to encoding numeric and multimodal data. For our task, current LLMs perform worse than a more traditional XGBoost architecture that combines fundamental and macroeconomic data with high-density text-based embedding features.

### The fine-scale structure of polar coronal holes
**Authors**: Richard J. Morton, R. Cunningham

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:41:59Z

**Summary**: Coronal holes are thought to be composed of relatively broad columnar structures known as plumes. Here we demonstrate that the plumes (and inter-plumes) in polar coronal holes are composed of fine-scale filamentary structure, with average scales of 2-10$^{\arcsec}$. The fine structure is the off-limb analogue of the previously found 'plumelets' of \cite{Uritsky_2021}. The off-limb observations enable an examination of the fine-structure without the influence of the underlying atmosphere along the line of sight. Hence, we show that the fine-scale structure is present at least until the edge of the field of view of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The fine structure is found to have spatial distribution that follows a $k^{-1}$ power law perpendicular to the inferred magnetic field direction. For a small sample of the fine structure, the cross-sectional profiles are measured as a function of height. In some cases, the measurements indicate that the fine structure expands super-radially, consistent with existing models of polar field expansion and the expansion of the plumes. We discuss the implications of the presence of the fine structure with respect to understanding wave propagation in the coronal holes and their contribution to powering the solar wind.

### ParGo: Bridging Vision-Language with Partial and Global Views
**Authors**: An-Lan Wang, Bin Shan, Wei Shi, Kun-Yu Lin, Xiang Fei, Guozhi Tang, Lei Liao, Jingqun Tang, Can Huang, Wei-Shi Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:39:15Z

**Summary**: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.

### A machine-learning classifier for the postmerger remnant of binary   neutron stars
**Authors**: Anna Puecher, Tim Dietrich

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:33:20Z

**Summary**: Knowing the kind of remnant produced after the merger of a binary neutron star system, e.g., if a black hole forms or not, would not only shed light on the equation of state describing the extremely dense matter inside neutron stars, but also help understand the physical processes involved in the postmerger phase. Moreover, in the event of a gravitational-wave detection, predicting the presence of a neutron star remnant is crucial in order to advise potential electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. In this work, we use Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and publicly available data from numerical-relativity simulations to construct a classifier that predicts the outcome of binary neutron star mergers, based on the binary's parameters inferred from gravitational-wave inspiral signals: total mass, mass-weighted tidal deformability, mass ratio, and effective inspiral spin. Employing parameters that can be estimated from the inspiral part of the signal only allows us to predict the remnant independently on the detection of a postmerger gravitational-wave signal. We build three different classifiers to distinguish between various potential scenarios, we estimate their accuracy and the confidence of their predictions. Finally, we apply the developed classifiers to real events data, finding that GW170817 most likely led to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star, while GW190425 to a prompt collapse to a black hole.

### Enhancing Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models for Zero-Shot Scene   Classification
**Authors**: Karim El Khoury, Maxime Zanella, Benoît Gérin, Tiffanie Godelaine, Benoît Macq, Saïd Mahmoudi, Christophe De Vleeschouwer, Ismail Ben Ayed

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:26:03Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models for remote sensing have shown promising uses thanks to their extensive pretraining. However, their conventional usage in zero-shot scene classification methods still involves dividing large images into patches and making independent predictions, i.e., inductive inference, thereby limiting their effectiveness by ignoring valuable contextual information. Our approach tackles this issue by utilizing initial predictions based on text prompting and patch affinity relationships from the image encoder to enhance zero-shot capabilities through transductive inference, all without the need for supervision and at a minor computational cost. Experiments on 10 remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over inductive zero-shot classification.

### START: A Generalized State Space Model with Saliency-Driven Token-Aware   Transformation
**Authors**: Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:15:19Z

**Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingeringlight/START.

**Authors**: Junjie Ye, Zhengyin Du, Xuesong Yao, Weijian Lin, Yufei Xu, Zehui Chen, Zaiyuan Wang, Sining Zhu, Zhiheng Xi, Siyu Yuan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Jiecao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:13:35Z

**Summary**: Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches. Code and data can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/bytedance-research/ToolHop.

### Applying Bayesian Data Analysis for Causal Inference about Requirements   Quality: A Controlled Experiment
**Authors**: Julian Frattini, Davide Fucci, Richard Torkar, Lloyd Montgomery, Michael Unterkalmsteiner, Jannik Fischbach, Daniel Mendez

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:12:47Z

**Summary**: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities. However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities. We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement. We conduct a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects. We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis. Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models. Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention. Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.

### Crossover Designs in Software Engineering Experiments: Review of the   State of Analysis
**Authors**: Julian Frattini, Davide Fucci, Sira Vegas

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:00:07Z

**Summary**: Experimentation is an essential method for causal inference in any empirical discipline. Crossover-design experiments are common in Software Engineering (SE) research. In these, subjects apply more than one treatment in different orders. This design increases the amount of obtained data and deals with subject variability but introduces threats to internal validity like the learning and carryover effect. Vegas et al. reviewed the state of practice for crossover designs in SE research and provided guidelines on how to address its threats during data analysis while still harnessing its benefits. In this paper, we reflect on the impact of these guidelines and review the state of analysis of crossover design experiments in SE publications between 2015 and March 2024. To this end, by conducting a forward snowballing of the guidelines, we survey 136 publications reporting 67 crossover-design experiments and evaluate their data analysis against the provided guidelines. The results show that the validity of data analyses has improved compared to the original state of analysis. Still, despite the explicit guidelines, only 29.5% of all threats to validity were addressed properly. While the maturation and the optimal sequence threats are properly addressed in 35.8% and 38.8% of all studies in our sample respectively, the carryover threat is only modeled in about 3% of the observed cases. The lack of adherence to the analysis guidelines threatens the validity of the conclusions drawn from crossover design experiments

### MC-VTON: Minimal Control Virtual Try-On Diffusion Transformer
**Authors**: Junsheng Luan, Guangyuan Li, Lei Zhao, Wei Xing

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:00:07Z

**Summary**: Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic try-on effects. They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which results in high training costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing a long inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of reference network or image encoder, then propose MC-VTON, enabling DiT to integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs by utilizing its intrinsic backbone. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1)Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2)Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3)Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters 0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4)Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, fewer inference steps, and fewer trainable parameters than baseline methods.

### CommitShield: Tracking Vulnerability Introduction and Fix in Version   Control Systems
**Authors**: Zhaonan Wu, Yanjie Zhao, Chen Wei, Zirui Wan, Yue Liu, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T08:52:55Z

**Summary**: Version control systems are commonly used to manage open-source software, in which each commit may introduce new vulnerabilities or fix existing ones. Researchers have developed various tools for detecting vulnerabilities in code commits, but their performance is limited by factors such as neglecting descriptive data and challenges in accurately identifying vulnerability introductions. To overcome these limitations, we propose CommitShield, which combines the code analysis capabilities of static analysis tools with the natural language and code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of vulnerability introduction and fix detection by generating precise descriptions and obtaining rich patch contexts. We evaluate CommitShield using the newly constructed vulnerability repair dataset, CommitVulFix, and a cleaned vulnerability introduction dataset. Experimental results indicate that CommitShield improves recall by 76%-87% over state-of-the-art methods in the vulnerability fix detection task, and its F1-score improves by 15%-27% in the vulnerability introduction detection task.

### LlaMADRS: Prompting Large Language Models for Interview-Based Depression   Assessment
**Authors**: Gaoussou Youssouf Kebe, Jeffrey M. Girard, Einat Liebenthal, Justin Baker, Fernando De la Torre, Louis-Philippe Morency

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T08:49:04Z

**Summary**: This study introduces LlaMADRS, a novel framework leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate depression severity assessment using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We employ a zero-shot prompting strategy with carefully designed cues to guide the model in interpreting and scoring transcribed clinical interviews. Our approach, tested on 236 real-world interviews from the Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics (CAMI) dataset, demonstrates strong correlations with clinician assessments. The Qwen 2.5--72b model achieves near-human level agreement across most MADRS items, with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) closely approaching those between human raters. We provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance across different MADRS items, highlighting strengths and current limitations. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with appropriate prompting, can serve as efficient tools for mental health assessment, potentially increasing accessibility in resource-limited settings. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing symptoms that rely on non-verbal cues, underscoring the need for multimodal approaches in future work.

### KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment
**Authors**: Zijian Zhao, Zhijie Cai, Tingwei Chen, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T08:23:43Z

**Summary**: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.

### Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and   integrability breaking
**Authors**: G. Akemann, F. Balducci, A. Chenu, P. Päßler, F. Roccati, R. Shir

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T07:58:58Z

**Summary**: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to the 1d Poisson point process. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, as inferred from the statistics matching that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, as the spins align, we recover the expected integrability (now in the non-Hermitian setup), indicated by 2d Poisson statistics. These conclusions are based on fitting the spin chain data of numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions to an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices also applies in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.

### MRJ-Agent: An Effective Jailbreak Agent for Multi-Round Dialogue
**Authors**: Fengxiang Wang, Ranjie Duan, Peng Xiao, Xiaojun Jia, Shiji Zhao, Cheng Wei, YueFeng Chen, Chongwen Wang, Jialing Tao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Hui Xue

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T07:46:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in their reservoir of knowledge and understanding capabilities, but they have also been shown to be prone to illegal or unethical reactions when subjected to jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method surpasses other attack methods and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate. We will make the corresponding code and dataset available for future research. The code will be released soon.

### SpotDiffusion: A Fast Approach For Seamless Panorama Generation Over   Time
**Authors**: Stanislav Frolov, Brian B. Moser, Andreas Dengel

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T07:35:10Z

**Summary**: Generating high-resolution images with generative models has recently been made widely accessible by leveraging diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale datasets. Various techniques, such as MultiDiffusion and SyncDiffusion, have further pushed image generation beyond training resolutions, i.e., from square images to panorama, by merging multiple overlapping diffusion paths or employing gradient descent to maintain perceptual coherence. However, these methods suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to generating and averaging numerous predictions, which is required in practice to produce high-quality and seamless images. This work addresses this limitation and presents a novel approach that eliminates the need to generate and average numerous overlapping denoising predictions. Our method shifts non-overlapping denoising windows over time, ensuring that seams in one timestep are corrected in the next. This results in coherent, high-resolution images with fewer overall steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing it with MultiDiffusion, SyncDiffusion, and StitchDiffusion. Our method offers several key benefits, including improved computational efficiency and faster inference times while producing comparable or better image quality.

### From Code to Compliance: Assessing ChatGPT's Utility in Designing an   Accessible Webpage -- A Case Study
**Authors**: Ammar Ahmed, Margarida Fresco, Fredrik Forsberg, Hallvard Grotli

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:51:46Z

**Summary**: Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content without barriers, yet a significant majority of most used websites fail to meet accessibility standards. This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.

### AADNet: Exploring EEG Spatiotemporal Information for Fast and Accurate   Orientation and Timbre Detection of Auditory Attention Based on A Cue-Masked   Paradigm
**Authors**: Keren Shi, Xu Liu, Xue Yuan, Haijie Shang, Ruiting Dai, Hanbin Wang, Yunfa Fu, Ning Jiang, Jiayuan He

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:51:17Z

**Summary**: Auditory attention decoding from electroencephalogram (EEG) could infer to which source the user is attending in noisy environments. Decoding algorithms and experimental paradigm designs are crucial for the development of technology in practical applications. To simulate real-world scenarios, this study proposed a cue-masked auditory attention paradigm to avoid information leakage before the experiment. To obtain high decoding accuracy with low latency, an end-to-end deep learning model, AADNet, was proposed to exploit the spatiotemporal information from the short time window of EEG signals. The results showed that with a 0.5-second EEG window, AADNet achieved an average accuracy of 93.46% and 91.09% in decoding auditory orientation attention (OA) and timbre attention (TA), respectively. It significantly outperformed five previous methods and did not need the knowledge of the original audio source. This work demonstrated that it was possible to detect the orientation and timbre of auditory attention from EEG signals fast and accurately. The results are promising for the real-time multi-property auditory attention decoding, facilitating the application of the neuro-steered hearing aids and other assistive listening devices.

### Gradient descent inference in empirical risk minimization
**Authors**: Qiyang Han, Xiaocong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:49:09Z

**Summary**: Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.   This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.   Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.

### What Does a Software Engineer Look Like? Exploring Societal Stereotypes   in LLMs
**Authors**: Muneera Bano, Hashini Gunatilake, Rashina Hoda

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:44:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly gained popularity and are being embedded into professional applications due to their capabilities in generating human-like content. However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes. This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role. Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field. As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it.

### Advanced Tutorial: Label-Efficient Two-Sample Tests
**Authors**: Weizhi Li, Visar Berisha, Gautam Dasarathy

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:43:18Z

**Summary**: Hypothesis testing is a statistical inference approach used to determine whether data supports a specific hypothesis. An important type is the two-sample test, which evaluates whether two sets of data points are from identical distributions. This test is widely used, such as by clinical researchers comparing treatment effectiveness. This tutorial explores two-sample testing in a context where an analyst has many features from two samples, but determining the sample membership (or labels) of these features is costly. In machine learning, a similar scenario is studied in active learning. This tutorial extends active learning concepts to two-sample testing within this \textit{label-costly} setting while maintaining statistical validity and high testing power. Additionally, the tutorial discusses practical applications of these label-efficient two-sample tests.

### Applying Large Language Models in Knowledge Graph-based Enterprise   Modeling: Challenges and Opportunities
**Authors**: Benedikt Reitemeyer, Hans-Georg Fill

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:34:17Z

**Summary**: The role of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise modeling has recently started to shift from academic research to that of industrial applications. Thereby, LLMs represent a further building block for the machine-supported generation of enterprise models. In this paper we employ a knowledge graph-based approach for enterprise modeling and investigate the potential benefits of LLMs in this context. In addition, the findings of an expert survey and ChatGPT-4o-based experiments demonstrate that LLM-based model generations exhibit minimal variability, yet remain constrained to specific tasks, with reliability declining for more intricate tasks. The survey results further suggest that the supervision and intervention of human modeling experts are essential to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the generated models.

### CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human   Intentions toward Public Events
**Authors**: Xiaojie Yang, Hangli Ge, Jiawei Wang, Zipei Fan, Renhe Jiang, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Noboru Koshizuka

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:30:24Z

**Summary**: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called CausalMob, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

### Bongard-OpenWorld: Few-Shot Reasoning for Free-form Visual Concepts in   the Real World
**Authors**: Rujie Wu, Xiaojian Ma, Zhenliang Zhang, Wei Wang, Qing Li, Song-Chun Zhu, Yizhou Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:28:56Z

**Summary**: We introduce Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating real-world few-shot reasoning for machine vision. It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.

### Persistent Homology with Path-Representable Distances on Graph Data
**Authors**: Eunwoo Heo, Byeongchan Choi, Jae-Hun Jung

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:00:53Z

**Summary**: Topological data analysis over graph has been actively studied to understand the underlying topological structure of data. However, limited research has been conducted on how different distance definitions impact persistent homology and the corresponding topological inference. To address this, we introduce the concept of path-representable distance in a general form and prove the main theorem for the case of cost-dominated distances. We found that a particular injection exists among the $1$-dimensional persistence barcodes of these distances with a certain condition. We prove that such an injection relation exists for $0$- and $1$-dimensional homology. For higher dimensions, we provide the counterexamples that show such a relation does not exist.

### On the Consideration of AI Openness: Can Good Intent Be Abused?
**Authors**: Yeeun Kim, Hyunseo Shin, Eunkyung Choi, Hongseok Oh, Hyunjun Kim, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:52:37Z

**Summary**: Open source is a driving force behind scientific advancement.However, this openness is also a double-edged sword, with the inherent risk that innovative technologies can be misused for purposes harmful to society. What is the likelihood that an open source AI model or dataset will be used to commit a real-world crime, and if a criminal does exploit it, will the people behind the technology be able to escape legal liability? To address these questions, we explore a legal domain where individual choices can have a significant impact on society. Specifically, we build the EVE-V1 dataset that comprises 200 question-answer pairs related to criminal offenses based on 200 Korean precedents first to explore the possibility of malicious models emerging. We further developed EVE-V2 using 600 fraud-related precedents to confirm the existence of malicious models that can provide harmful advice on a wide range of criminal topics to test the domain generalization ability. Remarkably, widely used open-source large-scale language models (LLMs) provide unethical and detailed information about criminal activities when fine-tuned with EVE. We also take an in-depth look at the legal issues that malicious language models and their builders could realistically face. Our findings highlight the paradoxical dilemma that open source accelerates scientific progress, but requires great care to minimize the potential for misuse. Warning: This paper contains content that some may find unethical.

### Beyond Factual Accuracy: Evaluating Coverage of Diverse Factual   Information in Long-form Text Generation
**Authors**: Chris Samarinas, Alexander Krubner, Alireza Salemi, Youngwoo Kim, Hamed Zamani

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:43:23Z

**Summary**: This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.

### PromptGuard: Soft Prompt-Guided Unsafe Content Moderation for   Text-to-Image Models
**Authors**: Lingzhi Yuan, Xinfeng Li, Chejian Xu, Guanhong Tao, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Wei Dong, Yang Liu, XiaoFeng Wang, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:39:21Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been shown to be vulnerable to misuse, particularly in generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 7.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.

### Practical Secure Inference Algorithm for Fine-tuned Large Language Model   Based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption
**Authors**: Zhang Ruoyan, Zheng Zhongxiang, Bao Wankang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:36:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models(LLMs) are currently at the forefront of the machine learning field, which show a broad application prospect but at the same time expose some risks of privacy leakage. We combined Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) and provable security theory with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) to propose an efficient and secure inference scheme for LLMs. More specially, we focus on pre-trained LLMs which rely on open-sourced base model and then fine-tuned with the private datasets by LoRA. This is a popular road-map for Vertical Domain Models such as LawGPT and BenTsao. We use two key technologies below. Firstly, we divide the whole model into the public part and the private part. The weights of public part are publicly accessible(e.g. the open-sourced base model) while the private part needs to be protected(e.g. the LoRA matrices). In this way, the overhead brought by computing on private data can be greatly reduced. Secondly, we propose a general method to transform a linear layer into another one which provides security against model extraction attacks and preserves its original functionality, which denoted as Private Linear Layer(PLL). Then we use this method on the LoRA matrices to make sure that the server protects their private weights without restricting the user's input. We also show that the difficulty of performing model extraction attacks for PLL can be reduced to the well-known hard problem Learning with Errors(LWE). Combing this method with FHE, we can protect user's input at the same time. In this paper, we use the open-source model ChatGLM2-6B as the base model which is fine-tuned by LoRA. Experimental results show the inference efficiency of our scheme reaches 1.61s/token which displays that the scheme has good practicality.

### ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity   within Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Zhengyan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xiyu Shi, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Guangli Li, Tao Yang, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:26:54Z

**Summary**: Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.

### Rescriber: Smaller-LLM-Powered User-Led Data Minimization for Navigating   Privacy Trade-offs in LLM-Based Conversational Agent
**Authors**: Jijie Zhou, Eryue Xu, Yaoyao Wu, Tianshi Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:20:13Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of LLM-based conversational agents has resulted in excessive disclosure of identifiable or sensitive information. However, existing technologies fail to offer perceptible control or account for users' personal preferences about privacy-utility tradeoffs due to the lack of user involvement. To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=12) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users' subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4o. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users' trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.

### Harnessing the Zero-Shot Power of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model   in End-to-End Speech Recognition
**Authors**: Yosuke Higuchi, Tetsuji Ogawa, Tetsunori Kobayashi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:15:54Z

**Summary**: We propose to utilize an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) for guiding the text generation process in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Modern large language models (LLMs) are adept at performing various text generation tasks through zero-shot learning, prompted with instructions designed for specific objectives. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to derive linguistic information that can facilitate text generation in end-to-end ASR models. Specifically, we instruct an LLM to correct grammatical errors in an ASR hypothesis and use the LLM-derived representations to refine the output further. The proposed model is built on the joint CTC and attention architecture, with the LLM serving as a front-end feature extractor for the decoder. The ASR hypothesis, subject to correction, is obtained from the encoder via CTC decoding and fed into the LLM along with a specific instruction. The decoder subsequently takes as input the LLM output to perform token predictions, combining acoustic information from the encoder and the powerful linguistic information provided by the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed LLM-guided model achieves a relative gain of approximately 13\% in word error rates across major benchmarks.

### SenseRAG: Constructing Environmental Knowledge Bases with Proactive   Querying for LLM-Based Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Xuewen Luo, Fan Ding, Fengze Yang, Yang Zhou, Junnyong Loo, Hwa Hui Tew, Chenxi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:15:46Z

**Summary**: This study addresses the critical need for enhanced situational awareness in autonomous driving (AD) by leveraging the contextual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional perception systems that rely on rigid, label-based annotations, it integrates real-time, multimodal sensor data into a unified, LLMs-readable knowledge base, enabling LLMs to dynamically understand and respond to complex driving environments. To overcome the inherent latency and modality limitations of LLMs, a proactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is designed for AD, combined with a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism, ensuring rapid and context-rich understanding. Experimental results using real-world Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) datasets demonstrate significant improvements in perception and prediction performance, highlighting the potential of this framework to enhance safety, adaptability, and decision-making in next-generation AD systems.

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:00:50Z

**Summary**: Chemistry experiments can be resource- and labor-intensive, often requiring manual tasks like polishing electrodes in electrochemistry. Traditional lab automation infrastructure faces challenges adapting to new experiments. To address this, we introduce ORGANA, an assistive robotic system that automates diverse chemistry experiments using decision-making and perception tools. It makes decisions with chemists in the loop to control robots and lab devices. ORGANA interacts with chemists using Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive experiment goals, handle disambiguation, and provide experiment logs. ORGANA plans and executes complex tasks with visual feedback, while supporting scheduling and parallel task execution. We demonstrate ORGANA's capabilities in solubility, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry experiments.

 ### Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of   Images and Videos
**Authors**: Haobo Yuan, Xiangtai Li, Tao Zhang, Zilong Huang, Shilin Xu, Shunping Ji, Yunhai Tong, Lu Qi, Jiashi Feng, Ming-Hsuan Yang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:58:54Z

**Summary**: This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.

### RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation   Performance
**Authors**: Matin Mortaheb, Mohammad A. Amir Khojastepour, Srimat T. Chakradhar, Sennur Ulukus

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:52:05Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.

### Influences on LLM Calibration: A Study of Response Agreement, Loss   Functions, and Prompt Styles
**Authors**: Yuxi Xia, Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Klim Zaporojets, Benjamin Roth

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:48:42Z

**Summary**: Calibration, the alignment between model confidence and prediction accuracy, is critical for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.

### (De)-Indexing and the Right to be Forgotten
**Authors**: Salvatore Vilella, Giancarlo Ruffo

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:46:34Z

**Summary**: In the digital age, the challenge of forgetfulness has emerged as a significant concern, particularly regarding the management of personal data and its accessibility online. The right to be forgotten (RTBF) allows individuals to request the removal of outdated or harmful information from public access, yet implementing this right poses substantial technical difficulties for search engines. This paper aims to introduce non-experts to the foundational concepts of information retrieval (IR) and de-indexing, which are critical for understanding how search engines can effectively "forget" certain content. We will explore various IR models, including boolean, probabilistic, vector space, and embedding-based approaches, as well as the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing data processing capabilities. By providing this overview, we seek to highlight the complexities involved in balancing individual privacy rights with the operational challenges faced by search engines in managing information visibility.

### Intelligent Router for LLM Workloads: Improving Performance Through   Workload-Aware Load Balancing

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:16:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) workloads have distinct prefill and decode phases with different compute and memory requirements which should ideally be accounted for when scheduling input queries across different LLM instances in a cluster. However existing scheduling algorithms treat LLM workloads as monolithic jobs without considering the distinct characteristics of the two phases in each workload. This leads to sub-optimal scheduling and increased response latency. In this work, we start by characterizing factors affecting the response latency during LLM inference serving. We establish that better load balancing of inference requests across the available LLM instances can improve the end-to-end latency to a larger extent than merely focusing on optimizing the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by our findings, we propose a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for data-driven and workload-aware scheduling. Our router schedules queries across LLM instances by leveraging a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads and achieves over 11% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches on a mix of public datasets and 7.8% lower end-to-end latency on real workload data with diverse input and output trends from Cloud Provider X. Additionally, the proposed framework can also serve as a standard for benchmarking different LLM inference schedulers since it provides the best latency for a given model, hardware, and instance-level scheduler combination.

### VLM-driven Behavior Tree for Context-aware Task Planning
**Authors**: Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Jun Takamatsu, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Katsushi Ikeuchi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T18:06:27Z

**Summary**: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Behavior Trees (BTs) has recently gained attention in the robotics community, yet remains in its early stages of development. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its feasibility and limitations.

### Vision Language Models as Values Detectors
**Authors**: Giulio Antonio Abbo, Tony Belpaeme

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:37:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models integrating textual and visual inputs have introduced new possibilities for interpreting complex data. Despite their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on visual stimuli, the alignment of these models with human perception in identifying relevant elements in images requires further exploration. This paper investigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators in detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We created a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and enlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image. We then compared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, including GPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree of alignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoring low. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential to detect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved training and refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeper insights and more contextually relevant responses.

### AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient   Attention Manipulation
**Authors**: Björn Deiseroth, Mayukh Deb, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:26:26Z

**Summary**: Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.

### Localizing AI: Evaluating Open-Weight Language Models for Languages of   Baltic States
**Authors**: Jurgita Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė, Toms Bergmanis, Mārcis Pinnis

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:24:17Z

**Summary**: Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation. The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages. Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs.

### Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks   for AI generated text detection
**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T17:00:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

### Scaling Efficient LLMs
**Authors**: B. N. Kausik

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:58:05Z

**Summary**: Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale more than four fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.44}$; (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.

### Information Extraction from Clinical Notes: Are We Ready to Switch to   Large Language Models?
**Authors**: Yan Hu, Xu Zuo, Yujia Zhou, Xueqing Peng, Jimin Huang, Vipina K. Keloth, Vincent J. Zhang, Ruey-Ling Weng, Qingyu Chen, Xiaoqian Jiang, Kirk E. Roberts, Hua Xu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:48:36Z

**Summary**: Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

### T-FREE: Subword Tokenizer-Free Generative LLMs via Sparse   Representations for Memory-Efficient Embeddings
**Authors**: Björn Deiseroth, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Samuel Weinbach

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:20:17Z

**Summary**: Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses. Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.   To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.

### Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Public   Transportation: San Antonio Case Study
**Authors**: Ramya Jonnala, Gongbo Liang, Jeong Yang, Izzat Alsmadi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:18:55Z

**Summary**: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into public transit systems presents a transformative opportunity to enhance urban mobility. This study explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times, and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential. San Antonio serves as a case study to inform the development of LLM-powered transit systems in other urban environments.

**Summary**: The increasing use of social media to share lived and living experiences of substance use presents a unique opportunity to obtain information on side effects, use patterns, and opinions on novel psychoactive substances. However, due to the large volume of data, obtaining useful insights through natural language processing technologies such as large language models is challenging. This paper aims to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture for medical question answering pertaining to clinicians' queries on emerging issues associated with health-related topics, using user-generated medical information on social media. We proposed a two-layer RAG framework for query-focused answer generation and evaluated a proof of concept for the framework in the context of query-focused summary generation from social media forums, focusing on emerging drug-related information. Our modular framework generates individual summaries followed by an aggregated summary to answer medical queries from large amounts of user-generated social media data in an efficient manner. We compared the performance of a quantized large language model (Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO), deployable in low-resource settings, with GPT-4. For this proof-of-concept study, we used user-generated data from Reddit to answer clinicians' questions on the use of xylazine and ketamine. Our framework achieves comparable median scores in terms of relevance, length, hallucination, coverage, and coherence when evaluated using GPT-4 and Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO, evaluated for 20 queries with 76 samples. There was no statistically significant difference between the two for coverage, coherence, relevance, length, and hallucination. A statistically significant difference was noted for the Coleman-Liau Index. Our RAG framework can effectively answer medical questions about targeted topics and can be deployed in resource-constrained settings.

### Finer: Investigating and Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Concept   Recognition in Large Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Jeonghwan Kim, Heng Ji

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:05:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.

### LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One   Vision Token
**Authors**: Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Zhe Yang, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:03:14Z

**Summary**: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.

### LEAP: LLM-powered End-to-end Automatic Library for Processing Social   Science Queries on Unstructured Data
**Authors**: Chuxuan Hu, Austin Peters, Daniel Kang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T16:00:40Z

**Summary**: Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present. Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data. However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers. Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited. To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML. LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations. LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries. LEAP achieves a 100% pass @ 3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.

### AlphaPO -- Reward shape matters for LLM alignment
**Authors**: Aman Gupta, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Sirou Zhu, Jiwoo Hong, Ankan Saha, Viral Gupta, Noah Lee, Eunki Kim, Jason Zhu, Natesh Pillai, S. Sathiya Keerthi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:46:42Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made huge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is skipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being learned. Examples include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responses are often reduced undesirably.   In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce AlphaPO, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter to help change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and over-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO leads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance for the instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B. The analysis and results presented highlight the importance of the reward shape, and how one can systematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improve alignment performance.

### CL3DOR: Contrastive Learning for 3D Large Multimodal Models via Odds   Ratio on High-Resolution Point Clouds
**Authors**: Keonwoo Kim, Yeongjae Cho, Taebaek Hwang, Minsoo Jo, Sangdo Han

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:42:32Z

**Summary**: Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to text-only tasks but can also function as multimodal models across various modalities, including audio, images, and videos. In particular, research on 3D Large Multimodal Models (3D LMMs) is making notable strides, driven by the potential of processing higher-dimensional data like point clouds. However, upon closer examination, we find that the visual and textual content within each sample of existing training datasets lacks both high informational granularity and clarity, which serve as a bottleneck for precise cross-modal understanding. To address these issues, we propose CL3DOR, Contrastive Learning for 3D large multimodal models via Odds ratio on high-Resolution point clouds, designed to ensure greater specificity and clarity in both visual and textual content. Specifically, we increase the density of point clouds per object and construct informative hard negative responses in the training dataset to penalize unwanted responses. To leverage hard negative responses, we incorporate the odds ratio as an auxiliary term for contrastive learning into the conventional language modeling loss. CL3DOR achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CL3DOR's key components through extensive experiments.

### LLaVA Steering: Visual Instruction Tuning with 500x Fewer Parameters   through Modality Linear Representation-Steering
**Authors**: Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:36:54Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.

### Helping LLMs Improve Code Generation Using Feedback from Testing and   Static Analysis
**Authors**: Greta Dolcetti, Vincenzo Arceri, Eleonora Iotti, Sergio Maffeis, Agostino Cortesi, Enea Zaffanella

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:30:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence, and the software engineering community has readily noticed their potential role in the software development life-cycle. Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing productivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness, and security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream commercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static analysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code generated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.   First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks. Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the generated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety vulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated code, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the models ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during the static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.   Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.

### Lived Experience Not Found: LLMs Struggle to Align with Experts on   Addressing Adverse Drug Reactions from Psychiatric Medication Use
**Authors**: Mohit Chandra, Siddharth Sriraman, Gaurav Verma, Harneet Singh Khanuja, Jose Suarez Campayo, Zihang Li, Michael L. Birnbaum, Munmun De Choudhury

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:30:02Z

**Summary**: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among mental health patients. With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.

### Progressive Document-level Text Simplification via Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dengzhao Fang, Jipeng Qiang, Yi Zhu, Yunhao Yuan, Wei Li, Yan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T15:14:37Z

**Summary**: Research on text simplification has primarily focused on lexical and sentence-level changes. Long document-level simplification (DS) is still relatively unexplored. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have excelled in many natural language processing tasks. However, their performance on DS tasks is unsatisfactory, as they often treat DS as merely document summarization. For the DS task, the generated long sequences not only must maintain consistency with the original document throughout, but complete moderate simplification operations encompassing discourses, sentences, and word-level simplifications. Human editors employ a hierarchical complexity simplification strategy to simplify documents. This study delves into simulating this strategy through the utilization of a multi-stage collaboration using LLMs. We propose a progressive simplification method (ProgDS) by hierarchically decomposing the task, including the discourse-level, topic-level, and lexical-level simplification. Experimental results demonstrate that ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models or direct prompting with LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art in the document simplification task.

### Hallucination Detox: Sensitivity Dropout (SenD) for Large Language Model   Training
**Authors**: Shahrad Mohammadzadeh, Juan David Guerra, Marco Bonizzato, Reihaneh Rabbany, Golnoosh Farnadi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:56:42Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:35:56Z

**Summary**: Thanks to the vast amount of available resources and unique propagation properties, terahertz (THz) frequency bands are viewed as a key enabler for achieving ultrahigh communication performance and precise sensing capabilities in future wireless systems. Recently, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) initiated an Industry Specification Group (ISG) on THz which aims at establishing the technical foundation for subsequent standardization of this technology, which is pivotal for its successful integration into future networks. Starting from the work recently finalized within this group, this paper provides an industrial perspective on potential use cases and frequency bands of interest for THz communication systems. We first identify promising frequency bands in the 100 GHz - 1 THz range, offering over 500 GHz of available spectrum that can be exploited to unlock the full potential of THz communications. Then, we present key use cases and application areas for THz communications, emphasizing the role of this technology and its advantages over other frequency bands. We discuss their target requirements and show that some applications demand for multi-Tbps data rates, latency below 0.5 ms, and sensing accuracy down to 0.5 cm. Additionally, we identify the main deployment scenarios and outline other enabling technologies crucial for overcoming the challenges faced by THz system. Finally, we summarize the past and ongoing standardization efforts focusing on THz communications, while also providing an outlook towards the inclusion of this technology as an integral part of the future sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication networks.

**Authors**: Jie Cao, Dian Jiao, Qiang Yan, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:09:22Z

**Summary**: Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to produce summaries that answer particular questions of interest, enabling greater user control and personalization. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), shows their impressive capability of textual understanding through large-scale pretraining, which implies the great potential of extractive snippet generation. In this paper, we systematically investigated two indispensable characteristics that the LLMs-based QFS models should be harnessed, Lengthy Document Summarization and Efficiently Fine-grained Query-LLM Alignment, respectively. Correspondingly, we propose two modules called Query-aware HyperExpert and Query-focused Infini-attention to access the aforementioned characteristics. These innovations pave the way for broader application and accessibility in the field of QFS technology. Extensive experiments conducted on existing QFS benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/IDEAL_Summary.

### MADation: Face Morphing Attack Detection with Foundation Models
**Authors**: Eduarda Caldeira, Guray Ozgur, Tahar Chettaoui, Marija Ivanovska, Fadi Boutros, Vitomir Struc, Naser Damer

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T14:06:57Z

**Summary**: Despite the considerable performance improvements of face recognition algorithms in recent years, the same scientific advances responsible for this progress can also be used to create efficient ways to attack them, posing a threat to their secure deployment. Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabeled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https: //github.com/gurayozgur/MADation

### NesTools: A Dataset for Evaluating Nested Tool Learning Abilities of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Han Han, Tong Zhu, Xiang Zhang, Mengsong Wu, Hao Xiong, Wenliang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:34:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.

### AllSpark: A Multimodal Spatio-Temporal General Intelligence Model with   Ten Modalities via Language as a Reference Framework
**Authors**: Run Shao, Cheng Yang, Qiujun Li, Qing Zhu, Yongjun Zhang, YanSheng Li, Yu Liu, Yong Tang, Dapeng Liu, Shizhong Yang, Haifeng Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:31:01Z

**Summary**: Leveraging multimodal data is an inherent requirement for comprehending geographic objects. However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%. The source code is available at https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/AllSpark.

### BoRA: Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption for Multi-Task Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Simen Eide, Arnoldo Frigessi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T13:28:00Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.

**Summary**: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems ( LLM-MAS ) have become a research hotspot since the rise of large language models (LLMs). However, with the continuous influx of new related works, the existing reviews struggle to capture them comprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these studies. We first discuss the definition of LLM-MAS, a framework encompassing much of previous work. We provide an overview of the various applications of LLM-MAS in (i) solving complex tasks, (ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii) evaluating generative agents. Building on previous studies, we also highlight several challenges and propose future directions for research in this field.

### Context-Alignment: Activating and Enhancing LLM Capabilities in Time   Series
**Authors**: Yuxiao Hu, Qian Li, Dongxiao Zhang, Jinyue Yan, Yuntian Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:40:35Z

**Summary**: Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.

### Realistic Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Maxime Zanella, Clément Fuchs, Christophe De Vleeschouwer, Ismail Ben Ayed

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:17:25Z

**Summary**: The zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely leveraged to improve predictive performance. However, previous works on transductive or test-time adaptation (TTA) often make strong assumptions about the data distribution, such as the presence of all classes. Our work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios, and introduces a more realistic evaluation framework, including: (i) a variable number of effective classes for adaptation within a single batch, and (ii) non-i.i.d. batches of test samples in online adaptation settings. We provide comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate how current transductive or TTA methods for VLMs systematically compromise the models' initial zero-shot robustness across various realistic scenarios, favoring performance gains under advantageous assumptions about the test samples' distributions. Furthermore, we introduce StatA, a versatile method that could handle a wide range of deployment scenarios, including those with a variable number of effective classes at test time. Our approach incorporates a novel regularization term designed specifically for VLMs, which acts as a statistical anchor preserving the initial text-encoder knowledge, particularly in low-data regimes.

**Authors**: Kaiyu Huang, Fengran Mo, Xinyu Zhang, Hongliang Li, You Li, Yuanchi Zhang, Weijian Yi, Yulong Mao, Jinchen Liu, Yuzhuang Xu, Jinan Xu, Jian-Yun Nie, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T12:15:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable multilingual capabilities in natural language processing, attracting global attention in both academia and industry. To mitigate potential discrimination and enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user groups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology. Despite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual scenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent approaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To this end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of LLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between previous and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce several perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and inference methods, information retrieval, model security, multi-domain with language culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges that arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we highlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with multilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address multilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural language processing based on LLMs.

**Authors**: Riccardo Andrea Izzo, Gianluca Bardaro, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T11:18:08Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to generating behavior trees for robots using lightweight large language models (LLMs) with a maximum of 7 billion parameters. The study demonstrates that it is possible to achieve satisfying results with compact LLMs when fine-tuned on a specific dataset. The key contributions of this research include the creation of a fine-tuning dataset based on existing behavior trees using GPT-3.5 and a comprehensive comparison of multiple LLMs (namely llama2, llama-chat, and code-llama) across nine distinct tasks. To be thorough, we evaluated the generated behavior trees using static syntactical analysis, a validation system, a simulated environment, and a real robot. Furthermore, this work opens the possibility of deploying such solutions directly on the robot, enhancing its practical applicability. Findings from this study demonstrate the potential of LLMs with a limited number of parameters in generating effective and efficient robot behaviors.

### Graph Neural Backdoor: Fundamentals, Methodologies, Applications, and   Future Directions
**Authors**: Xiao Yang, Gaolei Li, Jianhua Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T11:13:06Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced various downstream graph-relevant tasks, encompassing recommender systems, molecular structure prediction, social media analysis, etc. Despite the boosts of GNN, recent research has empirically demonstrated its potential vulnerability to backdoor attacks, wherein adversaries employ triggers to poison input samples, inducing GNN to adversary-premeditated malicious outputs. This is typically due to the controlled training process, or the deployment of untrusted models, such as delegating model training to third-party service, leveraging external training sets, and employing pre-trained models from online sources. Although there's an ongoing increase in research on GNN backdoors, comprehensive investigation into this field is lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We begin by outlining the fundamental definition of GNN, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoor attacks and defenses based on their technical characteristics and application scenarios. Subsequently, the analysis of the applicability and use cases of GNN backdoors is undertaken. Finally, the exploration of potential research directions of GNN backdoors is presented. This survey aims to explore the principles of graph backdoors, provide insights to defenders, and promote future security research.

### PSA-VLM: Enhancing Vision-Language Model Safety through Progressive   Concept-Bottleneck-Driven Alignment
**Authors**: Zhendong Liu, Yuanbi Nie, Yingshui Tan, Jiaheng Liu, Xiangyu Yue, Qiushi Cui, Chongjun Wang, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T11:09:52Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.

### On Beating $2^n$ for the Closest Vector Problem
**Authors**: Amir Abboud, Rajendra Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:34:17Z

**Summary**: The Closest Vector Problem (CVP) is a computational problem in lattices that is central to modern cryptography. The study of its fine-grained complexity has gained momentum in the last few years, partly due to the upcoming deployment of lattice-based cryptosystems in practice. A main motivating question has been if there is a $(2-\varepsilon)^n$ time algorithm on lattices of rank $n$, or whether it can be ruled out by SETH.   Previous work came tantalizingly close to a negative answer by showing a $2^{(1-o(1))n}$ lower bound under SETH if the underlying distance metric is changed from the standard $\ell_2$ norm to other $\ell_p$ norms. Moreover, barriers toward proving such results for $\ell_2$ (and any even $p$) were established.   In this paper we show \emph{positive results} for a natural special case of the problem that has hitherto seemed just as hard, namely $(0,1)$-$\mathsf{CVP}$ where the lattice vectors are restricted to be sums of subsets of basis vectors (meaning that all coefficients are $0$ or $1$). All previous hardness results applied to this problem, and none of the previous algorithmic techniques could benefit from it. We prove the following results, which follow from new reductions from $(0,1)$-$\mathsf{CVP}$ to weighted Max-SAT and minimum-weight $k$-Clique.   1. An $O(1.7299^n)$ time algorithm for exact $(0,1)$-$\mathsf{CVP}_2$ in Euclidean norm, breaking the natural $2^n$ barrier, as long as the absolute value of all coordinates in the input vectors is $2^{o(n)}$.   2. A computational equivalence between $(0,1)$-$\mathsf{CVP}_p$ and Max-$p$-SAT for all even $p$.   3. The minimum-weight-$k$-Clique conjecture from fine-grained complexity and its numerous consequences (which include the APSP conjecture) can now be supported by the hardness of a lattice problem, namely $(0,1)$-$\mathsf{CVP}_2$.

### SLAM: Towards Efficient Multilingual Reasoning via Selective Language   Alignment
**Authors**: Yuchun Fan, Yongyu Mu, Yilin Wang, Lei Huang, Junhao Ruan, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Shujian Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:29:43Z

**Summary**: Despite the significant improvements achieved by large language models (LLMs) in English reasoning tasks, these models continue to struggle with multilingual reasoning. Recent studies leverage a full-parameter and two-stage training paradigm to teach models to first understand non-English questions and then reason. However, this method suffers from both substantial computational resource computing and catastrophic forgetting. The fundamental cause is that, with the primary goal of enhancing multilingual comprehension, an excessive number of irrelevant layers and parameters are tuned during the first stage. Given our findings that the representation learning of languages is merely conducted in lower-level layers, we propose an efficient multilingual reasoning alignment approach that precisely identifies and fine-tunes the layers responsible for handling multilingualism. Experimental results show that our method, SLAM, only tunes 6 layers' feed-forward sub-layers including 6.5-8% of all parameters within 7B and 13B LLMs, achieving superior average performance than all strong baselines across 10 languages. Meanwhile, SLAM only involves one training stage, reducing training time by 4.1-11.9 compared to the two-stage method.

**Authors**: Andrew Li, Rahul Thapa, Rahul Chalamala, Qingyang Wu, Kezhen Chen, James Zou

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:21:21Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in understanding single images, aided by numerous high-quality instruction datasets. However, multi-image reasoning tasks are still under-explored in the open-source community due to two main challenges: (1) scaling datasets with multiple correlated images and complex reasoning instructions is resource-intensive and maintaining quality is difficult, and (2) there is a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for multi-image tasks. To address these issues, we introduce SMIR, an efficient synthetic data-generation pipeline for multi-image reasoning, and a high-quality dataset generated using this pipeline. Our pipeline efficiently extracts highly correlated images using multimodal embeddings, combining visual and descriptive information and leverages open-source LLMs to generate quality instructions. Using this pipeline, we generated 160K synthetic training samples, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive closed-source solutions. Additionally, we present SMIR-BENCH, a novel multi-image reasoning evaluation benchmark comprising 200 diverse examples across 7 complex multi-image reasoning tasks. SMIR-BENCH is multi-turn and utilizes a VLM judge to evaluate free-form responses, providing a comprehensive assessment of model expressiveness and reasoning capability across modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMIR dataset by fine-tuning several open-source VLMs and evaluating their performance on SMIR-BENCH. Our results show that models trained on our dataset outperform baseline models in multi-image reasoning tasks up to 8% with a much more scalable data pipeline.

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T10:09:13Z

**Summary**: Objective: A proof-of-concept study aimed at designing and implementing VIEWER, a versatile toolkit for visual analytics of clinical data, and systematically evaluating its effectiveness across various clinical applications while gathering feedback for iterative improvements.   Materials and Methods: VIEWER is an open-source and extensible toolkit that employs natural language processing and interactive visualisation techniques to facilitate the rapid design, development, and deployment of clinical information retrieval, analysis, and visualisation at the point of care. Through an iterative and collaborative participatory design approach, VIEWER was designed and implemented in one of the UK's largest NHS mental health Trusts, where its clinical utility and effectiveness were assessed using both quantitative and qualitative methods.   Results: VIEWER provides interactive, problem-focused, and comprehensive views of longitudinal patient data (n=409,870) from a combination of structured clinical data and unstructured clinical notes. Despite a relatively short adoption period and users' initial unfamiliarity, VIEWER significantly improved performance and task completion speed compared to the standard clinical information system. More than 1,000 users and partners in the hospital tested and used VIEWER, reporting high satisfaction and expressed strong interest in incorporating VIEWER into their daily practice.   Conclusion: VIEWER was developed to improve data accessibility and representation across various aspects of healthcare delivery, including population health management and patient monitoring. The deployment of VIEWER highlights the benefits of collaborative refinement in optimizing health informatics solutions for enhanced patient care.

**Authors**: Yannis Bendi-Ouis, Dan Dutartre, Xavier Hinaut

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:55:57Z

**Summary**: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.

### Forecasting Credit Ratings: A Case Study where Traditional Methods   Outperform Generative LLMs
**Authors**: Felix Drinkall, Janet B. Pierrehumbert, Stefan Zohren

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:46:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well for many downstream tasks. Transfer learning can enable LLMs to acquire skills that were not targeted during pre-training. In financial contexts, LLMs can sometimes beat well-established benchmarks. This paper investigates how well LLMs perform in the task of forecasting corporate credit ratings. We show that while LLMs are very good at encoding textual information, traditional methods are still very competitive when it comes to encoding numeric and multimodal data. For our task, current LLMs perform worse than a more traditional XGBoost architecture that combines fundamental and macroeconomic data with high-density text-based embedding features.

**Authors**: An-Lan Wang, Bin Shan, Wei Shi, Kun-Yu Lin, Xiang Fei, Guozhi Tang, Lei Liao, Jingqun Tang, Can Huang, Wei-Shi Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:39:15Z

**Summary**: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.

**Authors**: Junjie Ye, Zhengyin Du, Xuesong Yao, Weijian Lin, Yufei Xu, Zehui Chen, Zaiyuan Wang, Sining Zhu, Zhiheng Xi, Siyu Yuan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Jiecao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T09:13:35Z

**Summary**: Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches. Code and data can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/bytedance-research/ToolHop.

### CommitShield: Tracking Vulnerability Introduction and Fix in Version   Control Systems
**Authors**: Zhaonan Wu, Yanjie Zhao, Chen Wei, Zirui Wan, Yue Liu, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T08:52:55Z

**Summary**: Version control systems are commonly used to manage open-source software, in which each commit may introduce new vulnerabilities or fix existing ones. Researchers have developed various tools for detecting vulnerabilities in code commits, but their performance is limited by factors such as neglecting descriptive data and challenges in accurately identifying vulnerability introductions. To overcome these limitations, we propose CommitShield, which combines the code analysis capabilities of static analysis tools with the natural language and code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of vulnerability introduction and fix detection by generating precise descriptions and obtaining rich patch contexts. We evaluate CommitShield using the newly constructed vulnerability repair dataset, CommitVulFix, and a cleaned vulnerability introduction dataset. Experimental results indicate that CommitShield improves recall by 76%-87% over state-of-the-art methods in the vulnerability fix detection task, and its F1-score improves by 15%-27% in the vulnerability introduction detection task.

### LlaMADRS: Prompting Large Language Models for Interview-Based Depression   Assessment
**Authors**: Gaoussou Youssouf Kebe, Jeffrey M. Girard, Einat Liebenthal, Justin Baker, Fernando De la Torre, Louis-Philippe Morency

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T08:49:04Z

**Summary**: This study introduces LlaMADRS, a novel framework leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate depression severity assessment using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We employ a zero-shot prompting strategy with carefully designed cues to guide the model in interpreting and scoring transcribed clinical interviews. Our approach, tested on 236 real-world interviews from the Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics (CAMI) dataset, demonstrates strong correlations with clinician assessments. The Qwen 2.5--72b model achieves near-human level agreement across most MADRS items, with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) closely approaching those between human raters. We provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance across different MADRS items, highlighting strengths and current limitations. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with appropriate prompting, can serve as efficient tools for mental health assessment, potentially increasing accessibility in resource-limited settings. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing symptoms that rely on non-verbal cues, underscoring the need for multimodal approaches in future work.

### Benchmarking seismic phase associators: Insights from synthetic   scenarios
**Authors**: Jorge Puente, Christian Sippl, Jannes Münchmeyer, Ian W. McBrearty

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T08:42:25Z

**Summary**: Reliable seismicity catalogs are essential for seismology. Following phase picking, phase association groups arrivals into sets with consistent origins (i.e., events), determines event counts, and identifies outlier picks. To handle the substantial increase in the quantity of seismic phase picks from improved picking methods and larger deployments, several novel phase associators have recently been proposed. This study presents a detailed benchmark analysis of five seismic phase associators, including classical and machine learning-based approaches: PhaseLink, REAL, GaMMA, GENIE, and PyOcto. We use synthetic datasets mimicking real seismicity characteristics in crustal and subduction zone scenarios. We evaluate performance for different conditions, including low- and high-noise environments, out-of-network events, very high event rates, and variable station density. The results reveal notable differences in precision, recall, and computational efficiency. GENIE and PyOcto demonstrate robust performance, with almost perfect performance for most scenarios. Only for the most challenging conditions with high noise levels and event rates, performance drops but still maintains F1 scores above 0.8. PhaseLink's performance declines with noise and event density, particularly in subduction zones, dropping to near zero in the most complex cases. GaMMA outperforms PhaseLink but struggles with accuracy and scalability in high-noise, high-density scenarios. REAL performs reasonably but loses recall under extreme conditions. PyOcto and PhaseLink show the quickest runtimes for smaller-scale datasets, while REAL and GENIE are more than an order of magnitude slower for these cases. At the highest pick rates, GENIE's runtime disadvantage diminishes, matching PyOcto and scaling effectively. Our results can guide practitioners compiling seismicity catalogs and developers designing novel associators.

### MRJ-Agent: An Effective Jailbreak Agent for Multi-Round Dialogue
**Authors**: Fengxiang Wang, Ranjie Duan, Peng Xiao, Xiaojun Jia, Shiji Zhao, Cheng Wei, YueFeng Chen, Chongwen Wang, Jialing Tao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Hui Xue

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T07:46:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in their reservoir of knowledge and understanding capabilities, but they have also been shown to be prone to illegal or unethical reactions when subjected to jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method surpasses other attack methods and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate. We will make the corresponding code and dataset available for future research. The code will be released soon.

### From Code to Compliance: Assessing ChatGPT's Utility in Designing an   Accessible Webpage -- A Case Study
**Authors**: Ammar Ahmed, Margarida Fresco, Fredrik Forsberg, Hallvard Grotli

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:51:46Z

**Summary**: Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content without barriers, yet a significant majority of most used websites fail to meet accessibility standards. This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.

### What Does a Software Engineer Look Like? Exploring Societal Stereotypes   in LLMs
**Authors**: Muneera Bano, Hashini Gunatilake, Rashina Hoda

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:44:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly gained popularity and are being embedded into professional applications due to their capabilities in generating human-like content. However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes. This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role. Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field. As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it.

### Edge Graph Intelligence: Reciprocally Empowering Edge Networks with   Graph Intelligence
**Authors**: Liekang Zeng, Shengyuan Ye, Xu Chen, Xiaoxi Zhang, Ju Ren, Jian Tang, Yang Yang, Xuemin, Shen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:39:29Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed a thriving growth of computing facilities connected at the network edge, cultivating edge networks as a fundamental infrastructure for supporting miscellaneous intelligent services.Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) frontiers have extrapolated to the graph domain and promoted Graph Intelligence (GI). Given the inherent relation between graphs and networks, the interdiscipline of graph learning and edge networks, i.e., Edge GI or EGI, has revealed a novel interplay between them -- GI aids in optimizing edge networks, while edge networks facilitate GI model deployment. Driven by this delicate closed-loop, EGI is recognized as a promising solution to fully unleash the potential of edge computing power and is garnering growing attention. Nevertheless, research on EGI remains nascent, and there is a soaring demand within both the communications and AI communities for a dedicated venue to share recent advancements. To this end, this paper promotes the concept of EGI, explores its scope and core principles, and conducts a comprehensive survey concerning recent research efforts on this emerging field. Specifically, this paper introduces and discusses: 1) fundamentals of edge computing and graph learning,2) emerging techniques centering on the closed loop between graph intelligence and edge networks, and 3) open challenges and research opportunities of future EGI. By bridging the gap across communication, networking, and graph learning areas, we believe that this survey can garner increased attention, foster meaningful discussions, and inspire further research ideas in EGI.

### Applying Large Language Models in Knowledge Graph-based Enterprise   Modeling: Challenges and Opportunities
**Authors**: Benedikt Reitemeyer, Hans-Georg Fill

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:34:17Z

**Summary**: The role of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise modeling has recently started to shift from academic research to that of industrial applications. Thereby, LLMs represent a further building block for the machine-supported generation of enterprise models. In this paper we employ a knowledge graph-based approach for enterprise modeling and investigate the potential benefits of LLMs in this context. In addition, the findings of an expert survey and ChatGPT-4o-based experiments demonstrate that LLM-based model generations exhibit minimal variability, yet remain constrained to specific tasks, with reliability declining for more intricate tasks. The survey results further suggest that the supervision and intervention of human modeling experts are essential to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the generated models.

### CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human   Intentions toward Public Events
**Authors**: Xiaojie Yang, Hangli Ge, Jiawei Wang, Zipei Fan, Renhe Jiang, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Noboru Koshizuka

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:30:24Z

**Summary**: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called CausalMob, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

### Bongard-OpenWorld: Few-Shot Reasoning for Free-form Visual Concepts in   the Real World
**Authors**: Rujie Wu, Xiaojian Ma, Zhenliang Zhang, Wei Wang, Qing Li, Song-Chun Zhu, Yizhou Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T06:28:56Z

**Summary**: We introduce Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating real-world few-shot reasoning for machine vision. It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.

### On the Consideration of AI Openness: Can Good Intent Be Abused?
**Authors**: Yeeun Kim, Hyunseo Shin, Eunkyung Choi, Hongseok Oh, Hyunjun Kim, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:52:37Z

**Summary**: Open source is a driving force behind scientific advancement.However, this openness is also a double-edged sword, with the inherent risk that innovative technologies can be misused for purposes harmful to society. What is the likelihood that an open source AI model or dataset will be used to commit a real-world crime, and if a criminal does exploit it, will the people behind the technology be able to escape legal liability? To address these questions, we explore a legal domain where individual choices can have a significant impact on society. Specifically, we build the EVE-V1 dataset that comprises 200 question-answer pairs related to criminal offenses based on 200 Korean precedents first to explore the possibility of malicious models emerging. We further developed EVE-V2 using 600 fraud-related precedents to confirm the existence of malicious models that can provide harmful advice on a wide range of criminal topics to test the domain generalization ability. Remarkably, widely used open-source large-scale language models (LLMs) provide unethical and detailed information about criminal activities when fine-tuned with EVE. We also take an in-depth look at the legal issues that malicious language models and their builders could realistically face. Our findings highlight the paradoxical dilemma that open source accelerates scientific progress, but requires great care to minimize the potential for misuse. Warning: This paper contains content that some may find unethical.

### Beyond Factual Accuracy: Evaluating Coverage of Diverse Factual   Information in Long-form Text Generation
**Authors**: Chris Samarinas, Alexander Krubner, Alireza Salemi, Youngwoo Kim, Hamed Zamani

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:43:23Z

**Summary**: This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.

### PromptGuard: Soft Prompt-Guided Unsafe Content Moderation for   Text-to-Image Models
**Authors**: Lingzhi Yuan, Xinfeng Li, Chejian Xu, Guanhong Tao, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Wei Dong, Yang Liu, XiaoFeng Wang, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:39:21Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been shown to be vulnerable to misuse, particularly in generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 7.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.

### Practical Secure Inference Algorithm for Fine-tuned Large Language Model   Based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption
**Authors**: Zhang Ruoyan, Zheng Zhongxiang, Bao Wankang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:36:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models(LLMs) are currently at the forefront of the machine learning field, which show a broad application prospect but at the same time expose some risks of privacy leakage. We combined Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) and provable security theory with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) to propose an efficient and secure inference scheme for LLMs. More specially, we focus on pre-trained LLMs which rely on open-sourced base model and then fine-tuned with the private datasets by LoRA. This is a popular road-map for Vertical Domain Models such as LawGPT and BenTsao. We use two key technologies below. Firstly, we divide the whole model into the public part and the private part. The weights of public part are publicly accessible(e.g. the open-sourced base model) while the private part needs to be protected(e.g. the LoRA matrices). In this way, the overhead brought by computing on private data can be greatly reduced. Secondly, we propose a general method to transform a linear layer into another one which provides security against model extraction attacks and preserves its original functionality, which denoted as Private Linear Layer(PLL). Then we use this method on the LoRA matrices to make sure that the server protects their private weights without restricting the user's input. We also show that the difficulty of performing model extraction attacks for PLL can be reduced to the well-known hard problem Learning with Errors(LWE). Combing this method with FHE, we can protect user's input at the same time. In this paper, we use the open-source model ChatGLM2-6B as the base model which is fine-tuned by LoRA. Experimental results show the inference efficiency of our scheme reaches 1.61s/token which displays that the scheme has good practicality.

### ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity   within Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Zhengyan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xiyu Shi, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Guangli Li, Tao Yang, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:26:54Z

**Summary**: Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.

### Rescriber: Smaller-LLM-Powered User-Led Data Minimization for Navigating   Privacy Trade-offs in LLM-Based Conversational Agent
**Authors**: Jijie Zhou, Eryue Xu, Yaoyao Wu, Tianshi Li

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:20:13Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of LLM-based conversational agents has resulted in excessive disclosure of identifiable or sensitive information. However, existing technologies fail to offer perceptible control or account for users' personal preferences about privacy-utility tradeoffs due to the lack of user involvement. To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=12) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users' subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4o. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users' trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.

### Harnessing the Zero-Shot Power of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model   in End-to-End Speech Recognition
**Authors**: Yosuke Higuchi, Tetsuji Ogawa, Tetsunori Kobayashi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:15:54Z

**Summary**: We propose to utilize an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) for guiding the text generation process in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Modern large language models (LLMs) are adept at performing various text generation tasks through zero-shot learning, prompted with instructions designed for specific objectives. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to derive linguistic information that can facilitate text generation in end-to-end ASR models. Specifically, we instruct an LLM to correct grammatical errors in an ASR hypothesis and use the LLM-derived representations to refine the output further. The proposed model is built on the joint CTC and attention architecture, with the LLM serving as a front-end feature extractor for the decoder. The ASR hypothesis, subject to correction, is obtained from the encoder via CTC decoding and fed into the LLM along with a specific instruction. The decoder subsequently takes as input the LLM output to perform token predictions, combining acoustic information from the encoder and the powerful linguistic information provided by the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed LLM-guided model achieves a relative gain of approximately 13\% in word error rates across major benchmarks.

**Authors**: Xuewen Luo, Fan Ding, Fengze Yang, Yang Zhou, Junnyong Loo, Hwa Hui Tew, Chenxi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:15:46Z

**Summary**: This study addresses the critical need for enhanced situational awareness in autonomous driving (AD) by leveraging the contextual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional perception systems that rely on rigid, label-based annotations, it integrates real-time, multimodal sensor data into a unified, LLMs-readable knowledge base, enabling LLMs to dynamically understand and respond to complex driving environments. To overcome the inherent latency and modality limitations of LLMs, a proactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is designed for AD, combined with a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism, ensuring rapid and context-rich understanding. Experimental results using real-world Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) datasets demonstrate significant improvements in perception and prediction performance, highlighting the potential of this framework to enhance safety, adaptability, and decision-making in next-generation AD systems.

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T05:00:50Z

**Summary**: Chemistry experiments can be resource- and labor-intensive, often requiring manual tasks like polishing electrodes in electrochemistry. Traditional lab automation infrastructure faces challenges adapting to new experiments. To address this, we introduce ORGANA, an assistive robotic system that automates diverse chemistry experiments using decision-making and perception tools. It makes decisions with chemists in the loop to control robots and lab devices. ORGANA interacts with chemists using Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive experiment goals, handle disambiguation, and provide experiment logs. ORGANA plans and executes complex tasks with visual feedback, while supporting scheduling and parallel task execution. We demonstrate ORGANA's capabilities in solubility, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry experiments. In electrochemistry, it executes a 19-step plan in parallel to characterize quinone derivatives for flow batteries. Our user study shows ORGANA reduces frustration and physical demand by over 50%, with users saving an average of 80.3% of their time when using it.

### ChatBug: A Common Vulnerability of Aligned LLMs Induced by Chat   Templates
**Authors**: Fengqing Jiang, Zhangchen Xu, Luyao Niu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T04:42:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to follow instructions from users and engage in conversations. Techniques to enhance LLMs' instruction-following capabilities typically fine-tune them using data structured according to a predefined chat template. Although chat templates are shown to be effective in optimizing LLM performance, their impact on safety alignment of LLMs has been less understood, which is crucial for deploying LLMs safely at scale.   In this paper, we investigate how chat templates affect safety alignment of LLMs. We identify a common vulnerability, named ChatBug, that is introduced by chat templates. Our key insight to identify ChatBug is that the chat templates provide a rigid format that need to be followed by LLMs, but not by users. Hence, a malicious user may not necessarily follow the chat template when prompting LLMs. Instead, malicious users could leverage their knowledge of the chat template and accordingly craft their prompts to bypass safety alignments of LLMs. We develop two attacks to exploit the ChatBug vulnerability. We demonstrate that a malicious user can exploit the ChatBug vulnerability of eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and effectively elicit unintended responses from these models. Moreover, we show that ChatBug can be exploited by existing jailbreak attacks to enhance their attack success rates. We investigate potential countermeasures to ChatBug. Our results show that while adversarial training effectively mitigates the ChatBug vulnerability, the victim model incurs significant performance degradation. These results highlight the trade-off between safety alignment and helpfulness. Developing new methods for instruction tuning to balance this trade-off is an open and critical direction for future research

### HuRef: HUman-REadable Fingerprint for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boyi Zeng, Lizheng Wang, Yuncong Hu, Yi Xu, Chenghu Zhou, Xinbing Wang, Yu Yu, Zhouhan Lin

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T04:38:25Z

**Summary**: Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef.

### Effects of Robot Competency and Motion Legibility on Human Correction   Feedback
**Authors**: Shuangge Wang, Anjiabei Wang, Sofiya Goncharova, Brian Scassellati, Tesca Fitzgerald

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T04:17:15Z

**Summary**: As robot deployments become more commonplace, people are likely to take on the role of supervising robots (i.e., correcting their mistakes) rather than directly teaching them. Prior works on Learning from Corrections (LfC) have relied on three key assumptions to interpret human feedback: (1) people correct the robot only when there is significant task objective divergence; (2) people can accurately predict if a correction is necessary; and (3) people trade off precision and physical effort when giving corrections. In this work, we study how two key factors (robot competency and motion legibility) affect how people provide correction feedback and their implications on these existing assumptions. We conduct a user study ($N=60$) under an LfC setting where participants supervise and correct a robot performing pick-and-place tasks. We find that people are more sensitive to suboptimal behavior by a highly competent robot compared to an incompetent robot when the motions are legible ($p=0.0015$) and predictable ($p=0.0055$). In addition, people also tend to withhold necessary corrections ($p < 0.0001$) when supervising an incompetent robot and are more prone to offering unnecessary ones ($p = 0.0171$) when supervising a highly competent robot. We also find that physical effort positively correlates with correction precision, providing empirical evidence to support this common assumption. We also find that this correlation is significantly weaker for an incompetent robot with legible motions than an incompetent robot with predictable motions ($p = 0.0075$). Our findings offer insights for accounting for competency and legibility when designing robot interaction behaviors and learning task objectives from corrections.

**Authors**: Somnath Kumar, Vaibhav Balloli, Mercy Ranjit, Kabir Ahuja, Sunayana Sitaram, Kalika Bali, Tanuja Ganu, Akshay Nambi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T04:03:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but still struggle with non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving multilingual performance without extensive fine-tuning. We introduce a novel dynamic learning approach that optimizes prompt strategy, embedding model, and LLM per query at runtime. By adapting configurations dynamically, our method achieves significant improvements over static, best and random baselines. It operates efficiently in both offline and online settings, generalizing seamlessly across new languages and datasets. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with state-of-the-art multilingual embeddings, we achieve superior task performance across diverse linguistic contexts. Through systematic investigation and evaluation across 18 diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets we show our approach results in 10-15% improvements in multilingual performance over pre-trained models and 4x gains compared to fine-tuned, language-specific models.

### Exploring Gradient Subspaces: Addressing and Overcoming LoRA's   Limitations in Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Navyansh Mahla, Kshitij Sharad Jadhav, Ganesh Ramakrishnan

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T03:56:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with direct-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.

### Concept Matching with Agent for Out-of-Distribution Detection
**Authors**: Yuxiao Lee, Xiaofeng Cao, Jingcai Guo, Wei Ye, Qing Guo, Yi Chang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T03:53:12Z

**Summary**: The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captivated the attention of both academia and industry, transcending their initial role in dialogue generation. To expand the usage scenarios of LLM, some works enhance the effectiveness and capabilities of the model by introducing more external information, which is called the agent paradigm. Based on this idea, we propose a new method that integrates the agent paradigm into out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, aiming to improve its robustness and adaptability. Our proposed method, Concept Matching with Agent (CMA), employs neutral prompts as agents to augment the CLIP-based OOD detection process. These agents function as dynamic observers and communication hubs, interacting with both In-distribution (ID) labels and data inputs to form vector triangle relationships. This triangular framework offers a more nuanced approach than the traditional binary relationship, allowing for better separation and identification of ID and OOD inputs. Our extensive experimental results showcase the superior performance of CMA over both zero-shot and training-required methods in a diverse array of real-world scenarios.

### A Sequential Optimal Learning Approach to Automated Prompt Engineering   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shuyang Wang, Somayeh Moazeni, Diego Klabjan

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T03:51:10Z

**Summary**: Designing effective prompts is essential to guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses. Automated prompt engineering aims to reduce reliance on manual effort by streamlining the design, refinement, and optimization of natural language prompts. This paper proposes an optimal learning framework for automated prompt engineering, designed to sequentially identify effective prompt features while efficiently allocating a limited evaluation budget. We introduce a feature-based method to express prompts, which significantly broadens the search space. Bayesian regression is employed to utilize correlations among similar prompts, accelerating the learning process. To efficiently explore the large space of prompt features for a high quality prompt, we adopt the forward-looking Knowledge-Gradient (KG) policy for sequential optimal learning. The KG policy is computed efficiently by solving mixed-integer second-order cone optimization problems, making it scalable and capable of accommodating prompts characterized only through constraints. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms a set of benchmark strategies assessed on instruction induction tasks. The results highlight the advantages of using the KG policy for prompt learning given a limited evaluation budget. Our framework provides a solution to deploying automated prompt engineering in a wider range applications where prompt evaluation is costly.

**Authors**: Hongyu Chen, Weiming Zeng, Chengcheng Chen, Luhui Cai, Fei Wang, Yuhu Shi, Lei Wang, Wei Zhang, Yueyang Li, Hongjie Yan, Wai Ting Siok, Nizhuan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T03:21:43Z

**Summary**: In the fields of affective computing (AC) and brain-machine interface (BMI), the analysis of physiological and behavioral signals to discern individual emotional states has emerged as a critical research frontier. While deep learning-based approaches have made notable strides in EEG emotion recognition, particularly in feature extraction and pattern recognition, significant challenges persist in achieving end-to-end emotion computation, including real-time processing, individual adaptation, and seamless user interaction. This paper presents the EEG Emotion Copilot, a system optimizing a lightweight large language model (LLM) with 0.5B parameters operating in a local setting, which first recognizes emotional states directly from EEG signals, subsequently generates personalized diagnostic and treatment suggestions, and finally supports the automation of assisted electronic medical records. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical techniques in the novel data structure of prompt, model pruning and fine-tuning training, and deployment strategies aiming at improving real-time performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our optimized lightweight LLM-based copilot achieves an enhanced intuitive interface for participant interaction, superior accuracy of emotion recognition and assisted electronic medical records generation, in comparison to such models with similar scale parameters or large-scale parameters such as 1.5B, 1.8B, 3B and 7B. In summary, through these efforts, the proposed copilot is expected to advance the application of AC in the medical domain, offering innovative solution to mental health monitoring. The codes will be released at https://github.com/NZWANG/EEG_Emotion_Copilot.

### Entropy-Guided Attention for Private LLMs
**Authors**: Nandan Kumar Jha, Brandon Reagen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T03:17:47Z

**Summary**: The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised critical privacy concerns, necessitating advancements in private inference (PI), where computations are performed directly on encrypted data without revealing users' sensitive information. While PI offers a promising solution, its practical deployment is hindered by substantial communication and latency overheads, primarily stemming from nonlinear operations. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to characterize the role of nonlinearities in decoder-only language models, laying a principled foundation for optimizing transformer-architectures tailored to the demands of PI.   By leveraging Shannon's entropy as a quantitative measure, we uncover the previously unexplored dual significance of nonlinearities: beyond ensuring training stability, they are crucial for maintaining attention head diversity. Specifically, we find that their removal triggers two critical failure modes: {\em entropy collapse} in deeper layers that destabilizes training, and {\em entropic overload} in earlier layers that leads to under-utilization of Multi-Head Attention's (MHA) representational capacity.   We propose an entropy-guided attention mechanism paired with a novel entropy regularization technique to mitigate entropic overload. Additionally, we explore PI-friendly alternatives to layer normalization for preventing entropy collapse and stabilizing the training of LLMs with reduced-nonlinearities. Our study bridges the gap between information theory and architectural design, establishing entropy dynamics as a principled guide for developing efficient PI architectures. The code and implementation are available at \href{https://github.com/Nandan91/entropy-guided-attention-llm}{entropy-guided-llm}.

### Align-Pro: A Principled Approach to Prompt Optimization for LLM   Alignment
**Authors**: Prashant Trivedi, Souradip Chakraborty, Avinash Reddy, Vaneet Aggarwal, Amrit Singh Bedi, George K. Atia

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T03:14:39Z

**Summary**: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical as these models become increasingly integrated into various societal and decision-making processes. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), achieve alignment by fine-tuning model parameters, but these approaches are often computationally expensive and impractical when models are frozen or inaccessible for parameter modification. In contrast, prompt optimization is a viable alternative to RLHF for LLM alignment. While the existing literature has shown empirical promise of prompt optimization, its theoretical underpinning remains under-explored. We address this gap by formulating prompt optimization as an optimization problem and try to provide theoretical insights into the optimality of such a framework. To analyze the performance of the prompt optimization, we study theoretical suboptimality bounds and provide insights in terms of how prompt optimization depends upon the given prompter and target model. We also provide empirical validation through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that prompt optimization can effectively align LLMs, even when parameter fine-tuning is not feasible.

### Women, Infamous, and Exotic Beings: What Honorific Usages in Wikipedia   Reveal about the Socio-Cultural Norms
**Authors**: Sourabrata Mukherjee, Soumya Teotia, Sougata Saha, Monojit Choudhury

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T02:47:59Z

**Summary**: Honorifics serve as powerful linguistic markers that reflect social hierarchies and cultural values. This paper presents a large-scale, cross-linguistic exploration of usage of honorific pronouns in Bengali and Hindi Wikipedia articles, shedding light on how socio-cultural factors shape language. Using LLM (GPT-4o), we annotated 10, 000 articles of real and fictional beings in each language for several sociodemographic features such as gender, age, fame, and exoticness, and the use of honorifics. We find that across all feature combinations, use of honorifics is consistently more common in Bengali than Hindi. For both languages, the use non-honorific pronouns is more commonly observed for infamous, juvenile, and exotic beings. Notably, we observe a gender bias in use of honorifics in Hindi, with men being more commonly referred to with honorifics than women.

**Summary**: Queries to large language models (LLMs) can be divided into two parts: the instruction/question and the accompanying context. The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia or Wikipedia-like texts which are written in a neutral and factual tone. However, when RAG systems retrieve internet-based content, they encounter text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, introducing challenges for downstream tasks. The Reading with Intent task addresses this issue by evaluating how varying tones in context passages affect model performance. Building on prior work that focused on sarcasm, we extend this paradigm by constructing a dataset where context passages are transformed to $11$ distinct emotions using a better synthetic data generation approach. Using this dataset, we train an emotion translation model to systematically adapt passages to specified emotional tones. The human evaluation shows that the LLM fine-tuned to become the emotion-translator benefited from the synthetically generated data. Finally, the emotion-translator is used in the Reading with Intent task to transform the passages to a neutral tone. By neutralizing the passages, it mitigates the challenges posed by sarcastic passages and improves overall results on this task by about $3\%$.

### Hyperbolic Binary Neural Network
**Authors**: Jun Chen, Jingyang Xiang, Tianxin Huang, Xiangrui Zhao, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T02:15:58Z

**Summary**: Binary Neural Network (BNN) converts full-precision weights and activations into their extreme 1-bit counterparts, making it particularly suitable for deployment on lightweight mobile devices. While binary neural networks are typically formulated as a constrained optimization problem and optimized in the binarized space, general neural networks are formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem and optimized in the continuous space. This paper introduces the Hyperbolic Binary Neural Network (HBNN) by leveraging the framework of hyperbolic geometry to optimize the constrained problem. Specifically, we transform the constrained problem in hyperbolic space into an unconstrained one in Euclidean space using the Riemannian exponential map. On the other hand, we also propose the Exponential Parametrization Cluster (EPC) method, which, compared to the Riemannian exponential map, shrinks the segment domain based on a diffeomorphism. This approach increases the probability of weight flips, thereby maximizing the information gain in BNNs. Experimental results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification datasets with VGGsmall, ResNet18, and ResNet34 models illustrate the superior performance of our HBNN over state-of-the-art methods.

### INFELM: In-depth Fairness Evaluation of Large Text-To-Image Models
**Authors**: Di Jin, Xing Liu, Yu Liu, Jia Qing Yap, Andrea Wong, Adriana Crespo, Qi Lin, Zhiyuan Yin, Qiang Yan, Ryan Ye

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T02:10:45Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) have propelled the evolution of multi-modal AI systems, which have demonstrated the remarkable potential for industrial applications by emulating human-like cognition. However, they also pose significant ethical challenges, including amplifying harmful content and reinforcing societal biases. For instance, biases in some industrial image generation models highlighted the urgent need for robust fairness assessments. Most existing evaluation frameworks focus on the comprehensiveness of various aspects of the models, but they exhibit critical limitations, including insufficient attention to content generation alignment and social bias-sensitive domains. More importantly, their reliance on pixel-detection techniques is prone to inaccuracies.   To address these issues, this paper presents INFELM, an in-depth fairness evaluation on widely-used text-to-image models. Our key contributions are: (1) an advanced skintone classifier incorporating facial topology and refined skin pixel representation to enhance classification precision by at least 16.04%, (2) a bias-sensitive content alignment measurement for understanding societal impacts, (3) a generalizable representation bias evaluation for diverse demographic groups, and (4) extensive experiments analyzing large-scale text-to-image model outputs across six social-bias-sensitive domains. We find that existing models in the study generally do not meet the empirical fairness criteria, and representation bias is generally more pronounced than alignment errors. INFELM establishes a robust benchmark for fairness assessment, supporting the development of multi-modal AI systems that align with ethical and human-centric principles.

**Authors**: Yannis Katsis, Sara Rosenthal, Kshitij Fadnis, Chulaka Gunasekara, Young-Suk Lee, Lucian Popa, Vraj Shah, Huaiyu Zhu, Danish Contractor, Marina Danilevsky

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T01:52:56Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently become a very popular task for Large Language Models (LLMs). Evaluating them on multi-turn RAG conversations, where the system is asked to generate a response to a question in the context of a preceding conversation is an important and often overlooked task with several additional challenges. We present MTRAG: an end-to-end human-generated multi-turn RAG benchmark that reflects several real-world properties across diverse dimensions for evaluating the full RAG pipeline. MTRAG contains 110 conversations averaging 7.7 turns each across four domains for a total of 842 tasks. We also explore automation paths via synthetic data and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. Our human and automatic evaluations show that even state-of-the-art LLM RAG systems struggle on MTRAG. We demonstrate the need for strong retrieval and generation systems that can handle later turns, unanswerable questions, non-standalone questions, and multiple domains. MTRAG is available at https://github.com/ibm/mt-rag-benchmark.

### PlanLLM: Video Procedure Planning with Refinable Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dejie Yang, Zijing Zhao, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T01:50:11Z

**Summary**: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

### Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical   Applications
**Authors**: Atonu Ghosh, Devadeep Misra, Hirdesh Mewada

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T01:47:49Z

**Summary**: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.

### ISSR: Iterative Selection with Self-Review for Vocabulary Test   Distractor Generation
**Authors**: Yu-Cheng Liu, An-Zi Yen

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T01:45:02Z

**Summary**: Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills. Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words. Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests. However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options. In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams. We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design. To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options. Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.

### Rare-to-Frequent: Unlocking Compositional Generation Power of Diffusion   Models on Rare Concepts with LLM Guidance
**Authors**: Dongmin Park, Sebin Kim, Taehong Moon, Minkyu Kim, Kangwook Lee, Jaewoong Cho

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T01:41:13Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/krafton-ai/Rare-to-Frequent.

### Activating Associative Disease-Aware Vision Token Memory for LLM-Based   X-ray Report Generation
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Fuling Wang, Haowen Wang, Bo Jiang, Chuanfu Li, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian, Jin Tang

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T01:19:48Z

**Summary**: X-ray image based medical report generation achieves significant progress in recent years with the help of the large language model, however, these models have not fully exploited the effective information in visual image regions, resulting in reports that are linguistically sound but insufficient in describing key diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory-enhanced X-ray report generation model that effectively mimics the process of professional doctors writing medical reports. It considers both the mining of global and local visual information and associates historical report information to better complete the writing of the current report. Specifically, given an X-ray image, we first utilize a classification model along with its activation maps to accomplish the mining of visual regions highly associated with diseases and the learning of disease query tokens. Then, we employ a visual Hopfield network to establish memory associations for disease-related tokens, and a report Hopfield network to retrieve report memory information. This process facilitates the generation of high-quality reports based on a large language model and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including the IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and Chexpert Plus. The source code of this work is released on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis}.

### CoReQA: Uncovering Potentials of Language Models in Code Repository   Question Answering
**Authors**: Jialiang Chen, Kaifa Zhao, Jie Liu, Chao Peng, Jierui Liu, Hang Zhu, Pengfei Gao, Ping Yang, Shuiguang Deng

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T00:24:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models that enhance software development tasks, such as code generation, code completion, and code question answering (QA), have been extensively studied in both academia and the industry. The models are integrated into popular intelligent IDEs like JetBrains and Cursor. Current benchmarks for evaluating models' code comprehension capabilities primarily focus on code generation or completion, often neglecting QA, which is a crucial aspect of understanding code. Existing code QA benchmarks are derived from code comments with predefined patterns (e.g., CodeQA) or focus on specific domains, such as education (e.g., CS1QA). These benchmarks fail to capture the real-world complexity of software engineering and user requirements for understanding code repositories. To address this gap, we introduce CoReQA, a benchmark for Code Repository-level question answering, constructed from GitHub issues and comments from 176 popular repositories across four programming languages. Since questions and answers may include both natural language and code snippets, traditional evaluation metrics such as BLEU are inadequate for assessing repository-level QA performance. Thus, we provide an LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate QA performance from five aspects. Based on CoReQA, we evaluate the performance of three baselines, including two short-context models using generic retrieval strategies and one long-context model that utilizes the entire repository context. Evaluation results show that state-of-the-art proprietary and long-context models struggle to address repository-level questions effectively. Our analysis highlights the limitations of language models in assisting developers in understanding repositories and suggests future directions for improving repository comprehension systems through effective context retrieval methodologies.

**Authors**: Mohamad Fakih, Rahul Dharmaji, Halima Bouzidi, Gustavo Quiros Araya, Oluwatosin Ogundare, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T00:21:42Z

**Summary**: Software vulnerabilities continue to be ubiquitous, even in the era of AI-powered code assistants, advanced static analysis tools, and the adoption of extensive testing frameworks. It has become apparent that we must not simply prevent these bugs, but also eliminate them in a quick, efficient manner. Yet, human code intervention is slow, costly, and can often lead to further security vulnerabilities, especially in legacy codebases. The advent of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLM) has opened up the possibility for many software defects to be patched automatically. We propose LLM4CVE an LLM-based iterative pipeline that robustly fixes vulnerable functions in real-world code with high accuracy. We examine our pipeline with State-of-the-Art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 38B, and Llama 3 70B. We achieve a human-verified quality score of 8.51/10 and an increase in groundtruth code similarity of 20% with Llama 3 70B. To promote further research in the area of LLM-based vulnerability repair, we publish our testing apparatus, fine-tuned weights, and experimental data on our website

### LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Automated Crypto Portfolio Management
**Authors**: Yichen Luo, Yebo Feng, Jiahua Xu, Paolo Tasca, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T00:15:11Z

**Summary**: Cryptocurrency investment is inherently difficult due to its shorter history compared to traditional assets, the need to integrate vast amounts of data from various modalities, and the requirement for complex reasoning. While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora.   To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data from November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework outperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset pricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.

### Finding A Voice: Evaluating African American Dialect Generation for   Chatbot Technology
**Authors**: Sarah E. Finch, Ellie S. Paek, Sejung Kwon, Ikseon Choi, Jessica Wells, Rasheeta Chandler, Jinho D. Choi

**Updated**: 2025-01-07T00:07:01Z

**Summary**: As chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, designing systems that accommodate diverse user populations is crucial for fostering trust, engagement, and inclusivity. This study investigates the ability of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and evaluates the impact of AAVE usage on user experiences in chatbot applications. We analyze the performance of three LLM families (Llama, GPT, and Claude) in producing AAVE-like utterances at varying dialect intensities and assess user preferences across multiple domains, including healthcare and education. Despite LLMs' proficiency in generating AAVE-like language, findings indicate that AAVE-speaking users prefer Standard American English (SAE) chatbots, with higher levels of AAVE correlating with lower ratings for a variety of characteristics, including chatbot trustworthiness and role appropriateness. These results highlight the complexities of creating inclusive AI systems and underscore the need for further exploration of diversity to enhance human-computer interactions.

### Dataset Decomposition: Faster LLM Training with Variable Sequence Length   Curriculum
**Authors**: Hadi Pouransari, Chun-Liang Li, Jen-Hao Rick Chang, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu, Cem Koc, Vaishaal Shankar, Oncel Tuzel

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T23:51:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on datasets consisting of fixed-length token sequences. These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length (concat-and-chunk). Recent attention implementations mask cross-document attention, reducing the effective length of a chunk of tokens. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch-size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a computational cost proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach. Experiments on a web-scale corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances performance on standard language evaluations and long-context benchmarks, reaching target accuracy with up to 6x faster training compared to the baseline. Our method not only enables efficient pretraining on long sequences but also scales effectively with dataset size. Lastly, we shed light on a critical yet less studied aspect of training large language models: the distribution and curriculum of sequence lengths, which results in a non-negligible difference in performance.

### Superposition in Transformers: A Novel Way of Building Mixture of   Experts
**Authors**: Ayoub Ben Chaliah, Hela Dellagi

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T23:02:42Z

**Summary**: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge when adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks or domains. Conventional fine-tuning often overwrites existing knowledge, causing performance degradation on original tasks. We introduce Superposition in Transformers, a novel architecture that leverages autoencoders to superimpose the hidden representations of a base model and a fine-tuned model within a shared parameter space. By using B-spline-based blending coefficients and autoencoders that adaptively reconstruct hidden states based on the input data distribution, our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables a new paradigm of "in-model" superposition. This approach preserves original model capabilities while allowing compact domain-specific expertise to be added, and it supports dynamic switching between model states during inference.

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T22:06:32Z

**Summary**: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven an explosion of interest about their societal impacts. Much of the discourse around how they will impact social equity has been cautionary or negative, focusing on questions like "how might LLMs be biased and how would we mitigate those biases?" This is a vital discussion: the ways in which AI generally, and LLMs specifically, can entrench biases have been well-documented. But equally vital, and much less discussed, is the more opportunity-focused counterpoint: "what promising applications do LLMs enable that could promote equity?" If LLMs are to enable a more equitable world, it is not enough just to play defense against their biases and failure modes. We must also go on offense, applying them positively to equity-enhancing use cases to increase opportunities for underserved groups and reduce societal discrimination. There are many choices which determine the impact of AI, and a fundamental choice very early in the pipeline is the problems we choose to apply it to. If we focus only later in the pipeline -- making LLMs marginally more fair as they facilitate use cases which intrinsically entrench power -- we will miss an important opportunity to guide them to equitable impacts. Here, we highlight the emerging potential of LLMs to promote equity by presenting four newly possible, promising research directions, while keeping risks and cautionary points in clear view.

### Active Inference for Self-Organizing Multi-LLM Systems: A Bayesian   Thermodynamic Approach to Adaptation
**Authors**: Rithvik Prakki

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T21:24:40Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.

### Boosting of Thoughts: Trial-and-Error Problem Solving with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Sijia Chen, Baochun Li, Di Niu

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T21:18:24Z

**Summary**: The reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a wide range of problems critically relies on chain-of-thought prompting, which involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompts. Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.

### Software Engineering and Foundation Models: Insights from Industry Blogs   Using a Jury of Foundation Models
**Authors**: Hao Li, Cor-Paul Bezemer, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T20:49:13Z

**Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains. Our dataset, results, code and used prompts can be found in our online replication package at https://github.com/SAILResearch/fmse-blogs.

### Takeaways from Applying LLM Capabilities to Multiple Conversational   Avatars in a VR Pilot Study
**Authors**: Mykola Maslych, Christian Pumarada, Amirpouya Ghasemaghaei, Joseph J. LaViola Jr

**Updated**: 2025-01-06T20:46:00Z

**Summary**: We present a virtual reality (VR) environment featuring conversational avatars powered by a locally-deployed LLM, integrated with automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and lip-syncing. Through a pilot study, we explored the effects of three types of avatar status indicators during response generation. Our findings reveal design considerations for improving responsiveness and realism in LLM-driven conversational systems. We also detail two system architectures: one using an LLM-based state machine to control avatar behavior and another integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-grounded responses.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

**Summary**: As Robots become ever more important in our daily lives there's growing need for understanding how they're perceived by people. This study aims to investigate how the user perception of robots is influenced by displays of personality. Using LLMs and speech to text technology, we designed a within-subject study to compare two conditions: a personality-driven robot and a purely task-oriented, personality-neutral robot. Twelve participants, recruited from Socially Intelligent Robotics course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, interacted with a robot Nao tasked with asking them a set of medical questions under both conditions. After completing both interactions, the participants completed a user experience questionnaire measuring their emotional states and robot perception using standardized questionnaires from the SRI and Psychology literature.
