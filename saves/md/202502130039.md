**Authors**: Chenchen Gu, Xiang Lisa Li, Rohith Kuditipudi, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:58:04Z

**Summary**: Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

### Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh

**Summary**: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

### Libra: Architectural Support For Principled, Secure And Efficient   Balanced Execution On High-End Processors (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Hans Winderix, Marton Bognar, Lesly-Ann Daniel, Frank Piessens

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:48:15Z

**Summary**: Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?   We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.

### Glinthawk: A Two-Tiered Architecture for Offline LLM Inference
**Authors**: Pouya Hamadanian, Sadjad Fouladi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:36:32Z

**Summary**: We introduce Glinthawk, an architecture for offline Large Language Model (LLM) inference. By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the utilization of the high-end accelerators ("Tier 1") by offloading the attention mechanism to lower-end compute tier ("Tier 2"). This separation allows the memory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale independently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU VMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch processing. The prototype is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk.

### Your Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Secretly Models the Conditional   Distributions of Clean Data
**Authors**: Jingyang Ou, Shen Nie, Kaiwen Xue, Fengqi Zhu, Jiacheng Sun, Zhenguo Li, Chongxuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:42:19Z

**Summary**: Discrete diffusion models with absorbing processes have shown promise in language modeling. The key quantities to be estimated are the ratios between the marginal probabilities of two transitive states at all timesteps, called the concrete score. In this paper, we reveal that the concrete score in absorbing diffusion can be expressed as conditional probabilities of clean data, multiplied by a time-dependent scalar in an analytic form. Motivated by this finding, we propose reparameterized absorbing discrete diffusion (RADD), a dedicated diffusion model without time-condition that characterizes the time-independent conditional probabilities. Besides its simplicity, RADD can reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the time-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling interval, which enables sampling acceleration. Built upon the new perspective of conditional distributions, we further unify absorbing discrete diffusion and any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs), showing that the upper bound on the negative log-likelihood for the diffusion model can be interpreted as an expected negative log-likelihood for AO-ARMs. Further, our RADD models achieve SOTA performance among diffusion models on 5 zero-shot language modeling benchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/RADD.

### PIM Is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for Large Language   Model Inference
**Authors**: Yufeng Gu, Alireza Khadem, Sumanth Umesh, Ning Liang, Xavier Servot, Onur Mutlu, Ravi Iyer, Reetuparna Das

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:25:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-10T23:11:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-10T18:34:53Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

**Updated**: 2025-02-10T17:19:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on our meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.

### MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory   Augmentation and Scalable Complexity
**Authors**: Xiao Lv, Jiangxia Cao, Shijie Guan, Xiaoyou Zhou, Zhiguang Qi, Yaqiang Zang, Ming Li, Ben Wang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-10T15:17:49Z

**Summary**: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

### Prompt-Driven Continual Graph Learning
**Authors**: Qi Wang, Tianfei Zhou, Ye Yuan, Rui Mao

**Updated**: 2025-02-10T10:28:11Z

**Summary**: Continual Graph Learning (CGL), which aims to accommodate new tasks over evolving graph data without forgetting prior knowledge, is garnering significant research interest. Mainstream solutions adopt the memory replay-based idea, ie, caching representative data from earlier tasks for retraining the graph model. However, this strategy struggles with scalability issues for constantly evolving graphs and raises concerns regarding data privacy. Inspired by recent advancements in the prompt-based learning paradigm, this paper introduces a novel prompt-driven continual graph learning (PROMPTCGL) framework, which learns a separate prompt for each incoming task and maintains the underlying graph neural network model fixed. In this way, PROMPTCGL naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from previous tasks. More specifically, we propose hierarchical prompting to instruct the model from both feature- and topology-level to fully address the variability of task graphs in dynamic continual learning. Additionally, we develop a personalized prompt generator to generate tailored prompts for each graph node while minimizing the number of prompts needed, leading to constant memory consumption regardless of the graph scale. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that PROMPTCGL achieves superior performance against existing CGL approaches while significantly reducing memory consumption. Our code is available at https://github.com/QiWang98/PromptCGL.

### Portable, High-Frequency, and High-Voltage Control Circuits for   Untethered Miniature Robots Driven by Dielectric Elastomer Actuators
**Authors**: Qi Shao, Xin-Jun Liu, Huichan Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-10T05:33:25Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose a high-voltage, high-frequency control circuit for the untethered applications of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). The circuit board leverages low-voltage resistive components connected in series to control voltages of up to 1.8 kV within a compact size, suitable for frequencies ranging from 0 to 1 kHz. A single-channel control board weighs only 2.5 g. We tested the performance of the control circuit under different load conditions and power supplies. Based on this control circuit, along with a commercial miniature high-voltage power converter, we construct an untethered crawling robot driven by a cylindrical DEA. The 42-g untethered robots successfully obtained crawling locomotion on a bench and within a pipeline at a driving frequency of 15 Hz, while simultaneously transmitting real-time video data via an onboard camera and antenna. Our work provides a practical way to use low-voltage control electronics to achieve the untethered driving of DEAs, and therefore portable and wearable devices.

### Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection   Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics
**Authors**: Xuyang Ning, Wei Shi, Chao Zhang, Ciro Riccio, Jay Hyun Jo

**Updated**: 2025-02-09T20:52:26Z

**Summary**: The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is a powerful dual calorimeter capable of estimating particle energy from both ionization charge and scintillation light. Our study shows that, due to the recombination luminescence, the LArTPC functions as a self-compensating light calorimeter: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the increased luminescence relative to the electromagnetic component. Using 0.5--5 GeV electron neutrino charged current interactions as a case study, we show that good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) from 1--1.05 can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields (0.2--1.8 kV/cm), with better performance for neutrino energies above 2 GeV. This study highlights the potential of light calorimetry in LArTPCs for GeV neutrino energy reconstruction, complementing traditional charge calorimetry. Under ideal conditions of uniform light collection, we show that LArTPC light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the charge imaging calorimetry. Challenges arising from nonuniform light collection in large LArTPCs can be mitigated with a position-dependent light yield correction derived from 3D charge signal imaging.

### Enabling Autoregressive Models to Fill In Masked Tokens
**Authors**: Daniel Israel, Aditya Grover, Guy Van den Broeck

**Updated**: 2025-02-09T20:02:05Z

**Summary**: Historically, LLMs have been trained using either autoregressive (AR) or masked language modeling (MLM) objectives, with AR models gaining dominance in recent years. However, AR models are inherently incapable of masked infilling, which is the ability to predict masked tokens between past and future context. In contrast, MLM models suffer from intrinsic computational inefficiencies during both training and inference that hinder their scalability. This work introduces MARIA (Masked and Autoregressive Infilling Architecture), a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both paradigms to achieve state-of-the-art masked infilling performance. MARIA combines a pre-trained MLM and AR model by training a linear decoder that takes their concatenated hidden states as input. This minimal modification enables the AR model to perform infilling while retaining its inherent advantages in terms of faster inference with KV caching. Our results demonstrate that MARIA significantly outperforms existing methods, namely discrete diffusion models, on masked infilling tasks.

### Electric field control of nonlinear Hall effect in Weyl semimetal   TaIrTe4
**Authors**: Jiaju Yang, Lujun Wei, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Wei Niu, Shuo Wang, Feng Li, Ping Liu, Shuang Zhou, Yong Pu

**Updated**: 2025-02-09T17:09:20Z

**Summary**: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), as an important probe to reveal the symmetry breaking in topological properties of materials, opens up a new dimension for exploring the energy band structure and electron transport mechanism of quantum materials. Current studies mainly focus on the observation of material intrinsic the NLHE or inducing the NLHE response by artificially constructing corrugated/twisted twodimensionalmaterial systems. Notably, the modulation of NLHE signal strength, a core parameter of device performance, has attracted much attention, while theoretical predictions suggest that an applied electric field can achieve the NLHE enhancement through modulation of the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). Here we report effective modulation the magnitude and sign of the NLHE by applying additional constant electric fields of different directions and magnitudes in the semimetal TaIrTe4. The NLHE response strength is enhanced by 168 times compared to the intrinsic one at 4 K when the additional constant electric field of -0.5 kV/cm is applied to the b-axis of TaIrTe4 and the through a.c. current is parallel to the TaIrTe4 a-axis. Scaling law analysis suggests that the enhancement may be the result of the combined effect of the electric field on the intrinsic BCD and disorder scattering effect of TaIrTe4. This work provides a means to study the properties of TaIrTe4, as well as a valuable reference for the study of novel electronic devices.

### SphereFusion: Efficient Panorama Depth Estimation via Gated Fusion
**Authors**: Qingsong Yan, Qiang Wang, Kaiyong Zhao, Jie Chen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu, Fei Deng

**Updated**: 2025-02-09T11:36:45Z

**Summary**: Due to the rapid development of panorama cameras, the task of estimating panorama depth has attracted significant attention from the computer vision community, especially in applications such as robot sensing and autonomous driving. However, existing methods relying on different projection formats often encounter challenges, either struggling with distortion and discontinuity in the case of equirectangular, cubemap, and tangent projections, or experiencing a loss of texture details with the spherical projection. To tackle these concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines the strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion initially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two distinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and spherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the spherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features for fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical domain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the efficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama datasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only 17 ms on a 512$\times$1024 panorama image.

### Public DNS Resolvers Meet Content Delivery Networks: A Performance   Assessment of the Interplay
**Authors**: Nicholas Kernan, Joey Li, Rami Al-Dalky, Michael Rabinovich

**Updated**: 2025-02-09T03:49:52Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates two key performance aspects of the interplay between public DNS resolution services and content delivery networks -- the latency of DNS queries for resolving CDN-accelerated hostnames and the latency between the end-user and the CDN's edge server obtained by the user through a given resolution service. While these important issues have been considered in the past, significant developments, such as the IPv6 finally getting traction, the adoption of the ECS extension to DNS by major DNS resolution services, and the embracing of anycast by some CDNs warrant a reassessment under these new realities. Among the resolution services we consider, We find Google DNS and OpenDNS to lag behind the Cloudflare resolver and, for some CDNs, Quad9 in terms of DNS latency, and trace the cause to drastically lower cache hit rates. At the same time, we find that Google and OpenDNS have largely closed the gap with ISP resolvers in the quality of CDNs'client-to-edge-server mappings as measured by latency, while the Cloudflare resolver still shows some penalty with Akamai, and Quad9 exhibits a noticeable penalty with three of the four CDNs in the study, keeping up only for Cloudflare CDN that does not use DNS to map clients to servers. Finally, in several locations, we observe IPv6 penalty in the latency of client-to-CDN-edge-server mappings produced by the resolvers. Moreover, this penalty does not rise above typical thresholds employed by the Happy Eyeballs algorithm for falling back to IPv4 communication. Thus, dual-stacked clients in these locations may experience suboptimal performance.

### MC3: Memory Contention based Covert Channel Communication on Shared DRAM   System-on-Chips
**Authors**: Ismet Dagli, James Crea, Soner Seckiner, Yuanchao Xu, Selçuk Köse, Mehmet E. Belviranli

**Updated**: 2025-02-08T21:44:24Z

**Summary**: Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

### ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching
**Authors**: Xiaoniu Song, Zihang Zhong, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-08T14:11:25Z

**Summary**: The promising applications of large language models are often limited by the constrained GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help address this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation. This approach allows the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory, thereby reducing the overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively, which significantly impacts system performance. In this paper, we introduce ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that utilizes intermediate results to predict subsequent expert usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE eliminates passive cache misses, removes loading time from the critical path, and reduces the performance overhead associated with offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.20x (up to 3.21x) and 2.07x (up to 5.02x) in the prefill and decode stages, respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as evaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

### New and Improved Bounds for Markov Paging
**Authors**: Chirag Pabbaraju, Ali Vakilian

**Updated**: 2025-02-08T10:14:21Z

**Summary**: In the Markov paging model, one assumes that page requests are drawn from a Markov chain over the pages in memory, and the goal is to maintain a fast cache that suffers few page faults in expectation. While computing the optimal online algorithm $(\mathrm{OPT})$ for this problem naively takes time exponential in the size of the cache, the best-known polynomial-time approximation algorithm is the dominating distribution algorithm due to Lund, Phillips and Reingold (FOCS 1994), who showed that the algorithm is $4$-competitive against $\mathrm{OPT}$. We substantially improve their analysis and show that the dominating distribution algorithm is in fact $2$-competitive against $\mathrm{OPT}$. We also show a lower bound of $1.5907$-competitiveness for this algorithm -- to the best of our knowledge, no such lower bound was previously known.

### AdaFlow: Efficient Long Video Editing via Adaptive Attention Slimming   And Keyframe Selection
**Authors**: Shuheng Zhang, Yuqi Liu, Hongbo Zhou, Jun Peng, Yiyi Zhou, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2025-02-08T03:46:28Z

**Summary**: Despite great progress, text-driven long video editing is still notoriously challenging mainly due to excessive memory overhead. Although recent efforts have simplified this task into a two-step process of keyframe translation and interpolation generation, the token-wise keyframe translation still plagues the upper limit of video length. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach towards efficient and effective long video editing, termed AdaFlow. We first reveal that not all tokens of video frames hold equal importance for keyframe translation, based on which we propose an Adaptive Attention Slimming scheme for AdaFlow to squeeze the $KV$ sequence, thus increasing the number of keyframes for translations by an order of magnitude. In addition, an Adaptive Keyframe Selection scheme is also equipped to select the representative frames for joint editing, further improving generation quality. With these innovative designs, AdaFlow achieves high-quality long video editing of minutes in one inference, i.e., more than 1$k$ frames on one A800 GPU, which is about ten times longer than the compared methods, e.g., TokenFlow. To validate AdaFlow, we also build a new benchmark for long video editing with high-quality annotations, termed LongV-EVAL. Our code is released at: https://github.com/jidantang55/AdaFlow.

### APE: Faster and Longer Context-Augmented Generation via Adaptive   Parallel Encoding
**Authors**: Xinyu Yang, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-08T03:41:16Z

**Summary**: Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding ($\textbf{APE}$), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98% and 93% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6% and 7.9%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel. Efficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\times$ speedup by reducing 28$\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context.

### SMaCk: Efficient Instruction Cache Attacks via Self-Modifying Code   Conflicts
**Authors**: Seonghun Son, Daniel Moghimi, Berk Gulmezoglu

**Updated**: 2025-02-08T03:35:55Z

**Summary**: Self-modifying code (SMC) allows programs to alter their own instructions, optimizing performance and functionality on x86 processors. Despite its benefits, SMC introduces unique microarchitectural behaviors that can be exploited for malicious purposes. In this paper, we explore the security implications of SMC by examining how specific x86 instructions affecting instruction cache lines lead to measurable timing discrepancies between cache hits and misses. These discrepancies facilitate refined cache attacks, making them less noisy and more effective. We introduce novel attack techniques that leverage these timing variations to enhance existing methods such as Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload. Our advanced techniques allow adversaries to more precisely attack cryptographic keys and create covert channels akin to Spectre across various x86 platforms. Finally, we propose a dynamic detection methodology utilizing hardware performance counters to mitigate these enhanced threats.

### Automatic Hardware Pragma Insertion in High-Level Synthesis: A   Non-Linear Programming Approach
**Authors**: Stéphane Pouget, Louis-Noël Pouchet, Jason Cong

**Updated**: 2025-02-07T23:14:10Z

**Summary**: High-Level Synthesis enables the rapid prototyping of hardware accelerators, by combining a high-level description of the functional behavior of a kernel with a set of micro-architecture optimizations as inputs. Such optimizations can be described by inserting pragmas e.g. pipelining and replication of units, or even higher level transformations for HLS such as automatic data caching using the AMD/Xilinx Merlin compiler. Selecting the best combination of pragmas, even within a restricted set, remains particularly challenging and the typical state-of-practice uses design-space exploration to navigate this space. But due to the highly irregular performance distribution of pragma configurations, typical DSE approaches are either extremely time consuming, or operating on a severely restricted search space. This work proposes a framework to automatically insert HLS pragmas in regular loop-based programs, supporting pipelining, unit replication, and data caching. We develop an analytical performance and resource model as a function of the input program properties and pragmas inserted, using non-linear constraints and objectives. We prove this model provides a lower bound on the actual performance after HLS. We then encode this model as a Non-Linear Program, by making the pragma configuration unknowns of the system, which is computed optimally by solving this NLP. This approach can also be used during DSE, to quickly prune points with a (possibly partial) pragma configuration, driven by lower bounds on achievable latency. We extensively evaluate our end-to-end, fully implemented system, showing it can effectively manipulate spaces of billions of designs in seconds to minutes for the kernels evaluated.

### fMoE: Fine-Grained Expert Offloading for Large Mixture-of-Experts   Serving
**Authors**: Hanfei Yu, Xingqi Cui, Hong Zhang, Hao Wang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-07T22:51:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing various applications, including content generation, search and recommendation, and AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However, despite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory inefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to offload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving efficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or high model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs. To tame the latency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present fMoE, a fine-grained expert offloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with memory efficiency. We design fMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection patterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently guide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. fMoE is prototyped on top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed. Experiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that fMoE reduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 36% over state-of-the-art solutions.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-02-07T22:00:48Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models. The code is available at https://github.com/tensorgi/T6.

### Cached Multi-Lora Composition for Multi-Concept Image Generation
**Authors**: Xiandong Zou, Mingzhu Shen, Christos-Savvas Bouganis, Yiren Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-07T13:41:51Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted technique in text-to-image models, enabling precise rendering of multiple distinct elements, such as characters and styles, in multi-concept image generation. However, current approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for multi-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image quality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the denoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on the hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to "semantic conflicts", we find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and textures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the overall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we devise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal order in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy offers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive integration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully leverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA composition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached Multi-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while maintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for multi-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual LoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA composition and improve computational efficiency. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art training-free LoRA fusion methods by a significant margin -- it achieves an average improvement of $2.19\%$ in CLIPScore, and $11.25\%$ in MLLM win rate compared to LoraHub, LoRA Composite, and LoRA Switch.

### A-VL: Adaptive Attention for Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Mu Yuan, Ruiguang Zhong, Puhan Luo, Huiyou Zhan, Ningkang Zhang, Chengchen Hu, Xiangyang Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-07T13:09:17Z

**Summary**: The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) integrates computer vision and natural language processing techniques, offering substantial application potential. However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.

### Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge   Computing
**Authors**: Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-07T08:48:06Z

**Summary**: With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.

### Beyond Autoregression: Fast LLMs via Self-Distillation Through Time
**Authors**: Justin Deschenaux, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T20:26:24Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale, diffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.

### KVTuner: Sensitivity-Aware Layer-wise Mixed Precision KV Cache   Quantization for Efficient and Nearly Lossless LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T15:26:26Z

**Summary**: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

### AttentionPredictor: Temporal Pattern Matters for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T13:41:46Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

### Styx: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows
**Authors**: Kyriakos Psarakis, George Christodoulou, George Siachamis, Marios Fragkoulis, Asterios Katsifodimos

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T12:32:34Z

**Summary**: Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches provide weak transactional guarantees or perform expensive external state accesses requiring inefficient transactional protocols that increase execution latency.   In this paper, we present Styx, a novel dataflow-based SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions consisting of stateful functions that form arbitrary call-graphs with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol by contributing: i) a function acknowledgment scheme to determine transaction boundaries required in SFaaS workloads, ii) a function-execution caching mechanism, and iii) an early-commit reply mechanism that substantially reduces transaction execution latency. Experiments with the YCSB, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.

### PINT: Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models with Applications to   Long-term Inference on WeatherBench 2m-Temperature Data
**Authors**: Keon Vin Park, Jisu Kim, Jaemin Seo

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T12:19:34Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.   Our models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/KV-Park.

### PlaceIT: Placement-based Inter-Chiplet Interconnect Topologies
**Authors**: Patrick Iff, Benigna Bruggmann, Maciej Besta, Luca Benini, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T08:36:44Z

**Summary**: 2.5D integration technology is gaining traction as it copes with the exponentially growing design cost of modern integrated circuits. A crucial part of a 2.5D stacked chip is a low-latency and high-throughput inter-chiplet interconnect (ICI). Two major factors affecting the latency and throughput are the topology of links between chiplets and the chiplet placement. In this work, we present PlaceIT, a novel methodology to jointly optimize the ICI topology and the chiplet placement. While state-of-the-art methods optimize the chiplet placement for a predetermined ICI topology, or they select one topology out of a set of candidates, we generate a completely new topology for each placement. Our process of inferring placement-based ICI topologies connects chiplets that are in close proximity to each other, making it particularly attractive for chips with silicon bridges or passive silicon interposers with severely limited link lengths. We provide an open-source implementation of our method that optimizes the placement of homogeneously or heterogeneously shaped chiplets and the ICI topology connecting them for a user-defined mix of four different traffic types. We evaluate our methodology using synthetic traffic and traces, and we compare our results to a 2D mesh baseline. PlaceIT reduces the latency of synthetic L1-to-L2 and L2-to-memory traffic, the two most important types for cache coherency traffic, by up to 28% and 62%, respectively. It also achieve an average packet latency reduction of up to 18% on traffic traces. PlaceIT enables the construction of 2.5D stacked chips with low-latency ICIs.

### Identify Critical KV Cache in LLM Inference from an Output Perturbation   Perspective
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T06:31:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing but face significant challenges of high storage and runtime costs, due to the transformer architecture's reliance on self-attention, particularly the large Key-Value (KV) cache for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts to reduce KV cache size by pruning less critical entries based on attention weights remain empirical and lack formal grounding. This paper presents a formal study on identifying critical KV cache entries by analyzing attention output perturbation. Our analysis reveals that, beyond attention weights, the value states within KV entries and pretrained parameter matrices are also crucial. Based on this, we propose a perturbation-constrained selection algorithm that optimizes the worst-case output perturbation to identify critical entries. Evaluations on the Needle-in-a-Haystack test and Longbench benchmark show our algorithm enhances state-of-the-art cache eviction methods. Further empirical analysis confirms that our algorithm achieves lower output perturbations in over 92% attention heads in Llama model, thereby providing a significant improvement over existing methods.

### Adaptive Semantic Prompt Caching with VectorQ
**Authors**: Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Shu Liu, Alejandro Cuadron, Mark Zhao, Stephan Krusche, Alfons Kemper, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T04:16:20Z

**Summary**: Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different prompts. We propose VectorQ, a framework to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the complexity and uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of four diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 12x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 92%.

### UniCP: A Unified Caching and Pruning Framework for Efficient Video   Generation
**Authors**: Wenzhang Sun, Qirui Hou, Donglin Di, Jiahui Yang, Yongjia Ma, Jianxun Cui

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T03:56:11Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) excel in video generation but encounter significant computational challenges due to the quadratic complexity of attention. Notably, attention differences between adjacent diffusion steps follow a U-shaped pattern. Current methods leverage this property by caching attention blocks, however, they still struggle with sudden error spikes and large discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose UniCP a unified caching and pruning framework for efficient video generation. UniCP optimizes both temporal and spatial dimensions through. Error Aware Dynamic Cache Window (EDCW): Dynamically adjusts cache window sizes for different blocks at various timesteps, adapting to abrupt error changes. PCA based Slicing (PCAS) and Dynamic Weight Shift (DWS): PCAS prunes redundant attention components, and DWS integrates caching and pruning by enabling dynamic switching between pruned and cached outputs. By adjusting cache windows and pruning redundant components, UniCP enhances computational efficiency and maintains video detail fidelity. Experimental results show that UniCP outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency.

### Twilight: Adaptive Attention Sparsity with Hierarchical Top-$p$ Pruning
**Authors**: Chaofan Lin, Jiaming Tang, Shuo Yang, Hanshuo Wang, Tian Tang, Boyu Tian, Ion Stoica, Song Han, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2025-02-06T03:16:00Z

**Summary**: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.

### Efficiently Serving Large Multimodal Models Using EPD Disaggregation
**Authors**: Gursimran Singh, Xinglu Wang, Yifan Hu, Timothy Yu, Linzi Xing, Wei Jiang, Zhefeng Wang, Xiaolong Bai, Yi Li, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T22:55:47Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively impacting key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like time to first token (TTFT) and end-to-end throughput (E2ETP). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouple these steps unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a new mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize encoding load within a request, a module to find the optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15$\times$ less utilization), batch sizes (up to 22$\times$ larger), 10$\times$ more images/request, and 2.2$\times$ larger KV caches. Further, it leads to significant improvements in latency metrics (TTFT up to 71\% reduction) and end-to-end throughput (up to 57\% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

### ZACK: Zero-Overhead LLM Inference Acceleration via Dimensionality   Compression of the Key-Value Cache
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T21:44:56Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the Key-Value Cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference. In this work, we propose ZACK, the first KV dimensionality compression system that achieves zero-overhead compression and decompression and also reduces attention computation time. It complements and can be combined with eviction-based and quantization-based methods to further enhance KV compression. Moreover, ZACK employs adaptive compression, tailoring KV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to inference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss constraint. Additionally, ZACK enhances the self-attention kernel to balance the uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further reduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when combined with ZACK, state-of-the-art eviction-based and quantization-based methods for KV compression further reduce KV size by up to 68%, Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 44%, and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) by up to 55% and achieve up to 1.72X throughput under the same latency, while maintaining 99% of the baseline accuracy. We open-sourced the code.

### HACK: Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the Key-Value Cache   for Disaggregated LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen, Shay Vargaftik, Ran Ben Basat, Michael Mitzenmacher, Minlan Yu

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T20:09:51Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated Large Language Model (LLM) inference has gained popularity as it separates the computation-intensive prefill stage from the memory-intensive decode stage, avoiding the prefill-decode interference and improving resource utilization. However, transmitting Key-Value (KV) data between the two stages can be a bottleneck, especially for long prompts. Additionally, the computation time overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time (JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences. Existing KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and reduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization overhead, exacerbating the computation time.   We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK) for disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization step, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate and reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to disaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to state-of-the-art KV quantization methods.

### Efficient Prompt Compression with Evaluator Heads for Long-Context   Transformer Inference
**Authors**: Weizhi Fei, Xueyan Niu, Guoqing Xie, Yingqing Liu, Bo Bai, Wei Han

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T09:35:38Z

**Summary**: Although applications involving long-context inputs are crucial for the effective utilization of large language models (LLMs), they also result in increased computational costs and reduced performance. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient, training-free prompt compression method that retains key information within compressed prompts. We identify specific attention heads in transformer-based LLMs, which we designate as evaluator heads, that are capable of selecting tokens in long inputs that are most significant for inference. Building on this discovery, we develop EHPC, an Evaluator Head-based Prompt Compression method, which enables LLMs to rapidly "skim through" input prompts by leveraging only the first few layers with evaluator heads during the pre-filling stage, subsequently passing only the important tokens to the model for inference. EHPC achieves state-of-the-art results across two mainstream benchmarks: prompt compression and long-context inference acceleration. Consequently, it effectively reduces the complexity and costs associated with commercial API calls. We further demonstrate that EHPC attains competitive results compared to key-value cache-based acceleration methods, thereby highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency of LLMs for long-context tasks.

### A Systematic Study of Cross-Layer KV Sharing for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: You Wu, Haoyi Wu, Kewei Tu

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T08:22:05Z

**Summary**: Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2$\times$, most configurations can achieve higher throughput than standard transformers while maintaining competitive performance. When further reducing the size of the KV cache, however, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers performs better, at the expense of additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users make more informed choices of cross-layer KV sharing approaches and facilitate future research on efficient LLM inference.

### Qrazor: Reliable and Effortless 4-bit LLM Quantization by Significant   Data Razoring
**Authors**: Dongyoung Lee, Seungkyu Choi, Ik Joon Chang

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T08:10:45Z

**Summary**: Large-scale language models (LLMs) excel in language processing tasks but face deployment challenges due to high memory and computational demands. While low-bit quantization, such as 4-bit techniques, offers a potential solution, these methods often suffer from significant accuracy loss or require considerable effort for implementation such as reordering, rotation, etc. To address these challenges, we propose QRazor, a simple yet effective quantization scheme that enables 4-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. QRazor operates in two stages: first, quantizing data using 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis with absolute max scaling to preserve accuracy close to full-precision models, and second, compressing the quantized data to 4-bit using our significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits. Without any additional requirment of fine-tuning or additional training, QRazor achieves performance similar or better compared to state-of-the-art in 4-bit quantization method, surpassing Smoothquant and QLLM by over 12 points and Quarot(RTN) by more than 2.9 points in zero-shot reasoning task accuracy on the LLaMA2-7B model. Additionally, we introduce an integer-based arithmetic unit optimized for QRazor, allowing direct low-precision operations on SDR data without decompression.

### Accessible and Portable LLM Inference by Compiling Computational Graphs   into SQL
**Authors**: Wenbo Sun, Qiming Guo, Wenlu Wang, Rihan Hai

**Updated**: 2025-02-05T01:36:40Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) often demands specialized hardware, dedicated frameworks, and substantial development efforts, which restrict their accessibility, especially for edge devices and organizations with limited technical resources. We propose a novel compiler that translates LLM inference graphs into SQL queries, enabling relational databases, one of the most widely used and mature software systems globally, to serve as the runtime. By mapping neural operators such as matrix multiplication and attention into relational primitives like joins and aggregations, our approach leverages database capabilities, including disk-based data management and native caching. Supporting key transformer components, such as attention mechanisms and key-value caching, our system generates SQL pipelines for end-to-end LLM inference. Using the Llama3 family as a case study, we demonstrate up to 30x speedup in token generation for memory-constrained scenarios comparable to competitive CPU-based frameworks. Our work offers an accessible, portable, and efficient solution, facilitating the serving of LLMs across diverse deployment environments.

### Cache is King: Smart Page Eviction with eBPF
**Authors**: Tal Zussman, Ioannis Zarkadas, Jeremy Carin, Andrew Cheng, Hubertus Franke, Jonas Pfefferle, Asaf Cidon

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T22:37:17Z

**Summary**: The page cache is a central part of an OS. It reduces repeated accesses to storage by deciding which pages to retain in memory. As a result, the page cache has a significant impact on the performance of many applications. However, its one-size-fits-all eviction policy performs poorly in many workloads. While the systems community has experimented with a plethora of new and adaptive eviction policies in non-OS settings (e.g., key-value stores, CDNs), it is very difficult to implement such policies in the page cache, due to the complexity of modifying kernel code. To address these shortcomings, we design a novel eBPF-based framework for the Linux page cache, called $\texttt{cachebpf}$, that allows developers to customize the page cache without modifying the kernel. $\texttt{cachebpf}$ enables applications to customize the page cache policy for their specific needs, while also ensuring that different applications' policies do not interfere with each other and preserving the page cache's ability to share memory across different processes. We demonstrate the flexibility of $\texttt{cachebpf}$'s interface by using it to implement several eviction policies. Our evaluation shows that it is indeed beneficial for applications to customize the page cache to match their workloads' unique properties, and that they can achieve up to 70% higher throughput and 58% lower tail latency.

### CReIS: Computation Reuse through Image Similarity in ICN-Based Edge   Computing
**Authors**: Atiyeh Javaheri, Ali Bohlooli, Kamal Jamshidi

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T18:39:10Z

**Summary**: At the edge, there is a high level of similarity in computing. One approach that has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of edge computing is computation reuse, which eliminates redundant computations. Edge computing is integrated with the ICN architecture, capitalizing on its inherent intelligence to facilitate computation reuse and reduce redundancies in computing operations. In many past works, ICN's ability to enable computation reuse through caching has been limited. In this context, a new approach is proposed that considers computation requests with similar input data, which yield identical results, as equivalent. This method facilitates computation reuse through caching in ICN. The use of approximate results to reduce redundant computations without requiring high accuracy in input matching is provided. This concept is termed the Similarity Index, which effectively considers images to be similar despite minor changes in the angle of photography. The Similarity Index is determined through an algorithm known as HNSW and utilizes the SIFT descriptor to identify similar data. This approach helps reduce user latency times by providing quick access to results. The evaluation, simulated using the ndnSIM tool, showed an 86% improvement in completion time compared to scenarios without computation reuse, whereas previous works reported only a 70% improvement. To strengthen this method, an analytical model for computing request transfer considering computation reuse in ICN-based edge computing is provided. To assess the accuracy of the model, several evaluations have been conducted in the simulator by varying the parameters, resulting in a maximum error percentage of approximately 16%.

### Decentralized Federated Learning with Model Caching on Mobile Agents
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Wang, Guojun Xiong, Houwei Cao, Jian Li, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T17:14:22Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) trains a shared model using data and computation power on distributed agents coordinated by a central server. Decentralized FL (DFL) utilizes local model exchange and aggregation between agents to reduce the communication and computation overheads on the central server. However, when agents are mobile, the communication opportunity between agents can be sporadic, largely hindering the convergence and accuracy of DFL. In this paper, we propose Cached Decentralized Federated Learning (Cached-DFL) to investigate delay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on mobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of agents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange their own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation utilizes all models stored in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of Cached-DFL, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by caching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different DFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular network to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility, cache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, Cached-DFL converges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.

### EasySpec: Layer-Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Multi-GPU   Utilization
**Authors**: Yize Wu, Ke Gao, Yanjun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T17:09:21Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless method for Large Language Model (LLM) inference acceleration. It employs a smaller model to generate a draft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In multi-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor parallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically smaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting stage. To solve this problem, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation strategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization.EasySpec breaks the sequential execution order of layers in the drafting model, enabling multi-layer parallelization across devices, albeit with some induced approximation errors. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft model's key-value (KV) cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing long-term error accumulation at minimal additional latency. We evaluated EasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of models from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec can achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while preserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the drafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop of only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models.

### H-MBR: Hypervisor-level Memory Bandwidth Reservation for Mixed   Criticality Systems
**Authors**: Afonso Oliveira, Diogo Costa, Gonçalo Moreira, José Martins, Sandro Pinto

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T16:03:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in fields such as automotive and aerospace have driven a growing demand for robust computational resources. Applications that were once designed for basic MCUs are now deployed on highly heterogeneous SoC platforms. While these platforms deliver the necessary computational performance, they also present challenges related to resource sharing and predictability. These challenges are particularly pronounced when consolidating safety and non-safety-critical systems, the so-called Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS) to adhere to strict SWaP-C requirements. MCS consolidation on shared platforms requires stringent spatial and temporal isolation to comply with functional safety standards. Virtualization, mainly leveraged by hypervisors, is a key technology that ensures spatial isolation across multiple OSes and applications; however, ensuring temporal isolation remains challenging due to contention on shared hardwar resources, which impacts real-time performance and predictability. To mitigate this problem, several strategies as cache coloring and memory bandwidth reservation have been proposed. Although cache coloring is typically implemented on state-of-the-art hypervisors, memory bandwidth reservation approaches are commonly implemented at the Linux kernel level or rely on dedicated hardware and typically do not consider the concept of VMs that can run different OSes. To fill the gap between current memory bandwidth reservation solutions and the deployment of MCSs that operate on a hypervisor, this work introduces H-MBR, an open-source VM-centric memory bandwidth reservation mechanism. H-MBR features (i) VM-centric bandwidth reservation, (ii) OS and platform agnosticism, and (iii) reduced overhead. Empirical results evidenced no overhead on non-regulated workloads, and negligible overhead (<1%) for regulated workloads for regulation periods of 2 us or higher.

### A Scalable Crawling Algorithm Utilizing Noisy Change-Indicating Signals
**Authors**: Róbert Busa-Fekete, Julian Zimmert, András György, Linhai Qiu, Tzu-Wei Sung, Hao Shen, Hyomin Choi, Sharmila Subramaniam, Li Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T15:55:10Z

**Summary**: Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh, that is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given a limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the change and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson processes, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In this paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information indicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example, signals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available. Incorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging, because (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with missing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance over web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might differ from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm which (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild assumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii) is able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total bandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new optimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized computation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.

### Random Adaptive Cache Placement Policy
**Authors**: Vrushank Ahire, Pranav Menon, Aniruddh Muley, Abhinandan S. Prasad

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T14:33:44Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a new hybrid cache replacement algorithm that combines random allocation with a modified V-Way cache implementation. Our RAC adapts to complex cache access patterns and optimizes cache usage by improving the utilization of cache sets, unlike traditional cache policies. The algorithm utilizes a 16-way set-associative cache with 2048 sets, incorporating dynamic allocation and flexible tag management. RAC extends the V-Way cache design and its variants by optimizing tag and data storage for enhanced efficiency.   We evaluated the algorithm using the ChampSim simulator with four diverse benchmark traces and observed significant improvements in cache hit rates up to 80.82% hit rate. Although the improvements in the instructions per cycle (IPC) were moderate, our findings emphasize the algorithm's potential to enhance cache utilization and reduce memory access times.

### LightTransfer: Your Long-Context LLM is Secretly a Hybrid Model with   Effortless Adaptation
**Authors**: Xuan Zhang, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Wei Gao, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T13:45:37Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer contexts introduces substantial memory challenges due to the growing cost of key-value (KV) caches. Motivated by the efficiency gains of hybrid models and the broad availability of pretrained large transformer backbones, we explore transitioning transformer models into hybrid architectures for a more efficient generation. In this work, we propose LightTransfer, a lightweight method that transforms models such as LLaMA into hybrid variants. Our approach identifies lazy layers -- those focusing on recent or initial tokens -- and replaces their full attention with streaming attention. This transformation can be performed without any training for long-context understanding tasks or with minimal fine-tuning for o1-like long reasoning generation tasks that require stronger reasoning capabilities. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, QwQ-STILL) demonstrate that, even when half of the layers are identified as lazy, LightTransfer achieves up to 2.17$\times$ throughput improvement with minimal performance loss ($<1.5\%$ on LongBench) and achieves 53.3\% on math benchmark AIME24 of advanced o1-like long reasoning model QwQ-STILL.

### VLA-Cache: Towards Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model via Adaptive   Token Caching in Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Siyu Xu, Yunke Wang, Chenghao Xia, Dihao Zhu, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T09:48:14Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model can process instructions and visual perception to directly generate actions as output in an end-to-end fashion due to its strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. While the performance of VLA models is promising, their computational cost can be substantial. This raises challenge for applying them on robotics tasks, which requires real-time decision-making to respond quickly to environmental changes. Since robotic control involves sequential decision-making, the visual input often exhibits minimal variation between successive steps. A natural idea is to reuse the computational results of unchanged visual tokens from the last step. Motivated by this idea, we propose VLA-Cache, an efficient vision-language-action model. VLA-Cache incorporates a token-selection mechanism that compares the visual input at each step with the input from the previous step, adaptively identifying visual tokens with minimal changes. The computational results for these unchanged tokens are then reused in subsequent steps via KV-cache, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the VLA-Cache model. Experimental results on both simulation (e.g., LIBERO benchmark and SIMPLER) and real-world robot valid VLA-Cache can achieve practical acceleration with minimal sacrifice in success rate.

### PolarQuant: Quantizing KV Caches with Polar Transformation
**Authors**: Insu Han, Praneeth Kacham, Amin Karbasi, Vahab Mirrokni, Amir Zandieh

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T08:52:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) require significant memory to store Key-Value (KV) embeddings in their KV cache, especially when handling long-range contexts. Quantization of these KV embeddings is a common technique to reduce memory consumption. This work introduces PolarQuant, a novel quantization method employing random preconditioning and polar transformation. Our method transforms the KV embeddings into polar coordinates using an efficient recursive algorithm and then quantizes resulting angles. Our key insight is that, after random preconditioning, the angles in the polar representation exhibit a tightly bounded and highly concentrated distribution with an analytically computable form. This nice distribution eliminates the need for explicit normalization, a step required by traditional quantization methods which introduces significant memory overhead because quantization parameters (e.g., zero point and scale) must be stored in full precision per each data block. PolarQuant bypasses this normalization step, enabling substantial memory savings. The long-context evaluation demonstrates that PolarQuant compresses the KV cache by over x4.2 while achieving the best quality scores compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T08:16:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### LoRA-TTT: Low-Rank Test-Time Training for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yuto Kojima, Jiarui Xu, Xueyan Zou, Xiaolong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T07:40:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have intensified the need to address distribution shifts between training and testing datasets. Although prior Test-Time Training (TTT) techniques for VLMs have demonstrated robust performance, they predominantly rely on tuning text prompts, a process that demands substantial computational resources and is heavily dependent on entropy-based loss. In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a novel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively to the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its parameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT approach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while achieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime overhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss tailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these two losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of 5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently surpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or cache.

### MPIC: Position-Independent Multimodal Context Caching System for   Efficient MLLM Serving
**Authors**: Shiju Zhao, Junhao Hu, Rongxiao Huang, Jiaqi Zheng, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T03:13:09Z

**Summary**: The context caching technique is employed to accelerate the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) inference by prevailing serving platforms currently. However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local or remote disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated integrated reuse and recompute mechanisms within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54% reduction in response time compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.

**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Hong Chen, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Xiuze Zhou, Bo Li, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-02-04T02:23:06Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): the impact of KV cache compression methods on LLMs' fundamental capabilities. While existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on long-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain understudied. We present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating prominent KV cache compression methods across diverse tasks, spanning world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and long-context understanding and generation.Our analysis reveals that KV cache compression methods exhibit task-specific performance degradation. Arithmetic reasoning tasks prove particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with different methods showing performance drops of $17.4\%$-$43.3\%$. Notably, the DeepSeek R1 Distill model exhibits more robust compression tolerance compared to instruction-tuned models, showing only $9.67\%$-$25.53\%$ performance degradation. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task compression performance, we propose ShotKV, a novel compression approach that distinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level semantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves $9\%$-$18\%$ performance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive compression ratios.

### ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with   Low-Rank Residuals
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Sayeh Sharify, Kaushik Roy, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-03T21:45:32Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama and Qwen2.5 families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33\% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and upto 3\times speedup over 16-bit baseline. Code is available at https://github.com/utkarsh-dmx/project-resq.

### General kinetic ion induced electron emission model for metallic walls   applied to biased Z-pinch electrodes
**Authors**: Chirag R. Skolar, Kolter Bradshaw, Manaure Francisquez, Lucio Murillo, Vignesh Krishna Kumar, Bhuvana Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2025-02-03T20:30:25Z

**Summary**: A generalized kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. This framework is implemented as a boundary condition for the continuum kinetic Boltzmann equation. The IIEE model is used to study how emissions affect sheath formation near biased Z-pinch electrodes. 1X-1V (one spatial and one velocity dimension) Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a proton-electron plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 kV to 9 kV. The ions are accelerated to higher energies by the sheath potentials at the electrodes inducing electron emission. The secondary electron yield (SEY), defined as the ratio of the flux of emitted electrons to impacting ions, increases with bias potential at both electrodes, but more significantly at the cathode. Despite the SEY crossing 1 at 7 kV, a classical sheath, rather than a space-charge limited or inverse sheath, forms for all cases. The emitted electrons present as a beam that is accelerated by the sheath potential into the domain resulting in increased electron temperatures due to collisions. For bias potentials greater than 2 kV, the potential difference at the cathode is sufficiently strong for emissive heating to increase the plasma potential compared to emissionless simulations. The emitted electrons increase the current in the domain from 130 kA to 199 kA closely matching the experimental value of 200 kA.

### Scaling Embedding Layers in Language Models
**Authors**: Da Yu, Edith Cohen, Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Daogao Liu, Chiyuan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-03T18:59:32Z

**Summary**: We propose SCONE ($\textbf{S}$calable, $\textbf{C}$ontextualized, $\textbf{O}$ffloaded, $\textbf{N}$-gram $\textbf{E}$mbedding), a method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance as layer size scales. To avoid increased decoding costs, SCONE retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent $n$-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with a separate model during training. During inference, they are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory with minimal impact on inference speed. SCONE enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of cached $n$-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, all while maintaining fixed inference-time FLOPS. We show that scaling both aspects allows SCONE to outperform a 1.9B parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only half the inference-time FLOPS.

**Authors**: Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki

**Updated**: 2025-02-03T15:15:58Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple way to use large language models (LLMs) in education. Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.

### FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with   Token-Selective Propagation
**Authors**: Dongwon Jo, Jiwon Song, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim

**Updated**: 2025-02-03T05:25:09Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial key-value (KV) caches to store contextual information, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage. Previous efforts to compress these KV caches primarily focused on reducing memory demands but were limited in enhancing latency. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression method designed to enhance latency for long-context sequences. To enhance processing speeds while maintaining accuracy, FastKV adopts a novel Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) approach that retains the full context information in the initial layers of LLMs and selectively propagates only a portion of this information in deeper layers even in the prefill stage. Additionally, FastKV incorporates grouped-query attention (GQA)-aware KV cache compression to exploit the advantages of GQA in both memory and computational efficiency. Our experimental results show that FastKV achieves 2.00$\times$ and 1.40$\times$ improvements in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and throughput, respectively, compared to HeadKV, the state-of-the-art KV cache compression method. Moreover, FastKV successfully maintains accuracy on long-context benchmarks at levels comparable to the baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

### Implicit Shape and Appearance Priors for Few-Shot Full Head   Reconstruction
**Authors**: Pol Caselles, Eduard Ramon, Jaime Garcia, Gil Triginer, Francesc Moreno-Noguer

**Updated**: 2025-02-02T14:38:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in learning techniques that employ coordinate-based neural representations have yielded remarkable results in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. However, these approaches often require a substantial number of input views (typically several tens) and computationally intensive optimization procedures to achieve their effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations specifically for the problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. We accomplish this by incorporating a probabilistic shape and appearance prior into coordinate-based representations, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization when working with only a few input images (even as low as a single image). During testing, we leverage this prior to guide the fitting process of a signed distance function using a differentiable renderer. By incorporating the statistical prior alongside parallelizable ray tracing and dynamic caching strategies, we achieve an efficient and accurate approach to few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. Moreover, we extend the H3DS dataset, which now comprises 60 high-resolution 3D full head scans and their corresponding posed images and masks, which we use for evaluation purposes. By leveraging this dataset, we demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry reconstruction while being an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.

### RotateKV: Accurate and Robust 2-Bit KV Cache Quantization for LLMs via   Outlier-Aware Adaptive Rotations
**Authors**: Zunhai Su, Zhe Chen, Wang Shen, Hanyu Wei, Linge Li, Huangqi Yu, Kehong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-02T03:04:54Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache facilitates efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by avoiding recomputation of past KVs. As the batch size and context length increase, the oversized KV caches become a significant memory bottleneck, highlighting the need for efficient compression. Existing KV quantization rely on fine-grained quantization or the retention of a significant portion of high bit-widths caches, both of which compromise compression ratio and often fail to maintain robustness at extremely low average bit-widths. In this work, we explore the potential of rotation technique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves accurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i) Outlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the rotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii) Pre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position embedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths outliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages the massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks. RotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit quantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning and long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\% degradation on GSM8K, outperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths. RotateKV also showcases a 3.97x reduction in peak memory usage, supports 5.75x larger batch sizes, and achieves a 2.32x speedup in decoding stage.

### PolarQuant: Leveraging Polar Transformation for Efficient Key Cache   Quantization and Decoding Acceleration
**Authors**: Songhao Wu, Ang Lv, Xiao Feng, Yufei Zhang, Xun Zhang, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin, Rui Yan

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T18:59:03Z

**Summary**: The KV cache in large language models is a dominant factor in memory usage, limiting their broader applicability. Quantizing the cache to lower bit widths is an effective way to reduce computational costs; however, previous methods struggle with quantizing key vectors due to outliers, resulting in excessive overhead. We propose a novel quantization approach called PolarQuant, which efficiently addresses the outlier challenge. We observe that outliers typically appear in only one of two dimensions, which are rotated together by a specific angle when rotary position embeddings are applied. When represented as two-dimensional vectors, these dimensions exhibit well-structured patterns, with radii and angles smoothly distributed in polar coordinates. This alleviates the challenge of outliers on per-channel quantization, making them well-suited for quantization. Thus, PolarQuant divides key vectors into groups of two-dimensional sub-vectors, encoding them as the corresponding quantized radius and the polar angle, rather than quantizing original key vectors directly. PolarQuant achieves the superior efficiency in KV cache quantization and accelerates the decoding process by turning the query-key inner product into a table lookup, all while maintaining the downstream performance of full-precision models.

**Authors**: Isaac Zhang, Ryan Zarick, Daniel Wong, Thomas Kim, Bryan Pellegrino, Mignon Li, Kelvin Wong

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T16:00:50Z

**Summary**: Quick Merkle Database (QMDB) addresses longstanding bottlenecks in blockchain state management by integrating key-value (KV) and Merkle tree storage into a single unified architecture. QMDB delivers a significant throughput improvement over existing architectures, achieving up to 6X over the widely used RocksDB and 8X over NOMT, a leading verifiable database. Its novel append-only twig-based design enables one SSD read per state access, O(1) IOs for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a memory footprint as small as 2.3 bytes per entry, enabling it to run on even modest consumer-grade PCs. QMDB scales seamlessly across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2.28 million state updates per second. This performance enables support for 1 million token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution achieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding 15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to scale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces historical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical state at the latest block. QMDB not only meets the demands of current blockchains but also provides a robust foundation for building scalable, efficient, and verifiable decentralized applications across diverse use cases.

### UniAttn: Reducing Inference Costs via Softmax Unification for   Post-Training LLMs
**Authors**: Yizhe Xiong, Wei Huang, Xin Ye, Hui Chen, Zijia Lin, Haoran Lian, Zhenpeng Su, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T14:16:31Z

**Summary**: Post-training is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world applications. Deploying post-trained models faces significant challenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency. Existing work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed efficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV sharing. However, intra-layer KV sharing still results in high inference costs, while cross-layer KV sharing leads to significant performance degradation. As a result, both methods remain suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In this paper, we identify that the \texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary bottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant during post-training. We propose Softmax \textbf{Uni}fication in \textbf{Att}e\textbf{n}tion (\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method that unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM inference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate for the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn matches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing inference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during post-training. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Bostoncake/UniAttn}.

### CAT Pruning: Cluster-Aware Token Pruning For Text-to-Image Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Xinle Cheng, Zhuoming Chen, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T13:46:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks, especially in the domain of text-to-image synthesis; however, their iterative denoising process demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we present a novel acceleration strategy that integrates token-level pruning with caching techniques to tackle this computational challenge. By employing noise relative magnitude, we identify significant token changes across denoising iterations. Additionally, we enhance token selection by incorporating spatial clustering and ensuring distributional balance. Our experiments demonstrate reveal a 50%-60% reduction in computational costs while preserving the performance of the model, thereby markedly increasing the efficiency of diffusion models.

### Masked Generative Nested Transformers with Decode Time Scaling
**Authors**: Sahil Goyal, Debapriya Tula, Gagan Jain, Pradeep Shenoy, Prateek Jain, Sujoy Paul

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T09:41:01Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in visual generation have made significant strides in producing content of exceptional quality. However, most methods suffer from a fundamental problem - a bottleneck of inference computational efficiency. Most of these algorithms involve multiple passes over a transformer model to generate tokens or denoise inputs. However, the model size is kept consistent throughout all iterations, which makes it computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to address this issue primarily through two key ideas - (a) not all parts of the generation process need equal compute, and we design a decode time model scaling schedule to utilize compute effectively, and (b) we can cache and reuse some of the computation. Combining these two ideas leads to using smaller models to process more tokens while large models process fewer tokens. These different-sized models do not increase the parameter size, as they share parameters. We rigorously experiment with ImageNet256$\times$256 , UCF101, and Kinetics600 to showcase the efficacy of the proposed method for image/video generation and frame prediction. Our experiments show that with almost $3\times$ less compute than baseline, our model obtains competitive performance.

### QSpec: Speculative Decoding with Complementary Quantization Schemes
**Authors**: Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T04:24:16Z

**Summary**: Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.64x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Compared to state-of-art speculative decoding methods, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding extra memory overhead while achieving up to 1.55x speedup in batched serving with a high acceptance rate. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

### ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Bo Li, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T03:49:47Z

**Summary**: To reduce memory costs in long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent works focus on compressing the key-value (KV) cache of different tokens. However, we identify that the previous KV cache compression methods measure token importance individually, neglecting the dependency between different tokens in the real-world language characterics. In light of this, we introduce ChunkKV, grouping the tokens in a chunk as a basic compressing unit, and retaining the most informative semantic chunks while discarding the less important ones. Furthermore, observing that ChunkKV exhibits higher similarity in the preserved indices across different layers, we propose layer-wise index reuse to further reduce computational overhead. We evaluated ChunkKV on cutting-edge long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-In-A-HayStack, as well as the GSM8K and JailbreakV in-context learning benchmark. Our experiments with instruction tuning and multi-step reasoning (O1 and R1) LLMs, achieve up to 10\% performance improvement under aggressive compression ratios compared to existing methods.

### Learning to Compress Contexts for Efficient Knowledge-based Visual   Question Answering
**Authors**: Weixi Weng, Jieming Zhu, Xiaojun Meng, Hao Zhang, Rui Zhang, Chun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-01T03:40:37Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great performance on visual question answering (VQA). When it comes to knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack the specialized domain knowledge needed to answer questions, necessitating the retrieval of necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented MLLMs with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved knowledge for a given image-question pair, generating a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 63.92\% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0\%-59.7\% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.

### Activation Sparsity Opportunities for Compressing General Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Nobel Dhar, Bobin Deng, Md Romyull Islam, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Liang Zhao, Kun Suo

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T19:09:19Z

**Summary**: Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize the compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 2/3), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

### Offline Learning for Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Xutong Liu, Xiangxiang Dai, Jinhang Zuo, Siwei Wang, Carlee-Joe Wong, John C. S. Lui, Wei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T16:56:18Z

**Summary**: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a fundamental sequential decision-making framework, extensively studied over the past decade. However, existing work primarily focuses on the online setting, overlooking the substantial costs of online interactions and the readily available offline datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Off-CMAB, the first offline learning framework for CMAB. Central to our framework is the combinatorial lower confidence bound (CLCB) algorithm, which combines pessimistic reward estimations with combinatorial solvers. To characterize the quality of offline datasets, we propose two novel data coverage conditions and prove that, under these conditions, CLCB achieves a near-optimal suboptimality gap, matching the theoretical lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. We validate Off-CMAB through practical applications, including learning to rank, large language model (LLM) caching, and social influence maximization, showing its ability to handle nonlinear reward functions, general feedback models, and out-of-distribution action samples that excludes optimal or even feasible actions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets further highlight the superior performance of CLCB.

### Efficient Beam Search for Large Language Models Using Trie-Based   Decoding
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Jui-Hung Cheng, Mao Xun Huang, Chao-Ting Chen, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T16:22:36Z

**Summary**: In Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence generation, beam search has proven effective in enhancing the quality of generated sequences compared to greedy decoding. Conventional beam search methods typically adopt either a sequential or batch-based approach. The sequential approach, while memory-efficient, requires multiple decoding passes to construct a complete search tree, leading to significantly slower inference. On the other hand, the batch-based approach enables parallel computation across beams, but at the expense of high memory consumption due to the need to maintain separate key-value (KV) caches for each beam. In this study, we introduce a novel trie (prefix-tree)-based parallel decoding method that addresses the memory inefficiency of batch-based beam search. By sharing a single KV cache among all beams that share the same prefix, the proposed method not only reduces memory consumption dramatically but also enables parallel decoding across all branches. This innovative use of a prefix tree offers an efficient alternative for beam search, achieving significant memory savings while preserving inference speed, making it particularly well-suited for memory-constrained environments or large-scale model deployments.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Error-Optimized Cache
**Authors**: Junxiang Qiu, Shuo Wang, Jinda Lu, Lin Liu, Houcheng Jiang, Yanbin Hao

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T15:58:15Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC). This method introduces three key improvements: (1) Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; (2) A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; (3) Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching (especially over-caching). On the ImageNet dataset, without significantly increasing the computational burden, this method improves the quality of the generated images under the over-caching, rule-based, and training-based methods. Specifically, the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) values are improved as follows: from 6.857 to 5.821, from 3.870 to 3.692 and form 3.539 to 3.451 respectively.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Caching   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T14:26:05Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method.

### CLOVER: Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors Pruning and Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Fanxu Meng, Pingzhi Tang, Fan jiang, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T14:13:49Z

**Summary**: Decoder-only models generate tokens autoregressively by caching key/value vectors, but as the cache grows, inference becomes memory-bound. To address this issue, we introduce CLOVER (Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors), a novel approach that treats pairs of attention layers as a set of low-rank decompositions. CLOVER applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the \( Q \)-\( K \) and \( V \)-\( O \) pairs within each attention head. The resulting singular values can either guide pruning or serve as trainable parameters for efficient fine-tuning of all orthogonal vectors. After pruning or fine-tuning, these values are reintegrated into the model without increasing its parameter count. We apply CLOVER to various models, including GPT-2 XL, DeepSeek-V2-Lite, Whisper-Large-v3, Stable Diffusion XL, and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision. Our results demonstrate that CLOVER significantly improves pruning efficiency. For instance, the perplexity of pruning 70\% of the \( Q \)-\( K \) pairs in GPT-2 XL is similar to that of pruning just 8\% with vanilla methods. Fine-tuning the singular values further results in a full-rank update, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (LoRA, DoRA, HiRA, and PiSSA) by 7.6\%, 5.5\%, 3.8\%, and 0.7\%, respectively, on eight commonsense tasks for LLaMA-2 7B.

### Swift: Rethinking RDMA Control Plane for Elastic Computing
**Authors**: Junxue Zhang, Han Tian, Xinyang Huang, Wenxue Li, Kaiqiang Xu, Dian Shen, Yong Wang, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T11:25:40Z

**Summary**: Elastic computing enables dynamic scaling to meet workload demands, and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enhances this by providing high-throughput, low-latency network communication. However, integrating RDMA into elastic computing remains a challenge, particularly in control plane operations for RDMA connection setup.   This paper revisits the assumptions of prior work on high-performance RDMA for elastic computing, and reveals that extreme microsecond-level control plane optimizations are often unnecessary. By challenging the conventional beliefs on the slowness of user-space RDMA control plane and the difficulty of user-space RDMA resource sharing, we uncover new design opportunities. Our key insight is that user-space RDMA connection setup can be significantly improved with caching, while RDMA resources can be efficiently shared among processes using fork. In light of this, we propose Swift, a simple yet effective solution that co-designs RDMA with a serverless framework to optimize performance for elastic computing. At its very core, Swift handles cold and warm serverless requests by swiftly initializing the RDMA control plane with cache-optimized libibverbs, and manages fork requests by leveraging the RDMA's fork capability. Implemented with OpenWhisk, Swift delivers 30.56-46.50% higher average throughput and 18.55-37.21% lower latency, at a cost of 6.5% control plane overhead, compared to prior solutions.

### The development of IBIC microscopy at the 100 kV ion implanter of the   University of Torino (LIUTo) and the application for the assessment of the   radiation hardness of a silicon photodiode
**Authors**: Emilio Corte, Alberto Bortone, Elena Nieto Hernández, Carlo Ceresa, Georgios Provatas, Karla Ivanković Nizić, Milko Jaksić, Ettore Vittone, Sviatoslav Ditalia Tchernij

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T10:43:00Z

**Summary**: The Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) technique is widely used to characterize the electronic properties of semiconductor materials and devices. Its main advantage over other charge collection microscopies stems in the use of MeV ion probes, which provide both measurable induced charge signals from single ions, and high spatial resolution, which is maintained along the ion range. It is a fact, however, that the use of low-energy ions in the keV range can provide the IBIC technique with complementary analytical capabilities, that are not available with MeV ions, for example the higher sensitivity to the status, contamination and morphology of the surface and the fact that the induced signal depends on the transport of only one type of charge carrier. This paper outlines the upgrade that was made at the 100 kV ion implanter of the University of Torino, originally installed for material and surface modification, to explore the rather unexplored keV-IBIC field and to assess its potential to characterize semiconductor devices. Finally, we report the first IBIC application of our apparatus, which regards the assessment of the radiation damage of a commercially available silicon photodiode, adopting the IAEA experimental protocol and the relevant interpretative model.

### Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Transformers via Token Selection
**Authors**: Antoine Simoulin, Namyong Park, Xiaoyi Liu, Grey Yang

**Updated**: 2025-01-31T00:43:50Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning provides an effective means to specialize pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning often incurs high memory overhead, especially for large transformer-based models, such as LLMs. While existing methods may reduce certain parts of the memory required for fine-tuning, they still require caching all intermediate activations computed in the forward pass to update weights during the backward pass. In this work, we develop TokenTune, a method to reduce memory usage, specifically the memory to store intermediate activations, in the fine-tuning of transformer-based models. During the backward pass, TokenTune approximates the gradient computation by backpropagating through just a subset of input tokens. Thus, with TokenTune, only a subset of intermediate activations are cached during the forward pass. Also, TokenTune can be easily combined with existing methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory cost. We evaluate our approach on pre-trained transformer models with up to billions of parameters, considering the performance on multiple downstream tasks such as text classification and question answering in a few-shot learning setup. Overall, TokenTune achieves performance on par with full fine-tuning or representative memory-efficient fine-tuning methods, while greatly reducing the memory footprint, especially when combined with other methods with complementary memory reduction mechanisms. We hope that our approach will facilitate the fine-tuning of large transformers, in specializing them for specific domains or co-training them with other neural components from a larger system.

### REPS: Recycled Entropy Packet Spraying for Adaptive Load Balancing and   Failure Mitigation
**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Michael Papamichael, Mohammad Dohadwala, Lukas Gianinazzi, Mikhail Khalilov, Elias Achermann, Daniele De Sensi, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-01-30T18:23:46Z

**Summary**: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilizations as datacenter topologies (and network failures as a consequence) continue to grow. To address these limitations, we propose REPS, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. REPS adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, REPS re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. REPS is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and introduces less than 25 bytes of per-connection state. We extensively evaluate REPS in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.

### State Stream Transformer (SST) : Emergent Metacognitive Behaviours   Through Latent State Persistence
**Authors**: Thea Aviss

**Updated**: 2025-01-30T14:03:36Z

**Summary**: We introduce the State Stream Transformer (SST), a novel LLM architecture that reveals emergent reasoning behaviours and capabilities latent in pretrained weights through addressing a fundamental limitation in traditional transformer models: the lack of latent computational continuity across autoregressive generations in the state space. SST introduces a sliding window latent state (FFN) cache with weighted decay that maintains and evolves persistent latent processes throughout autoregressive generations. Through controlled experiments comparing base and SST architectures using the same frozen weights, we demonstrate that this architectural modification alone enables enhanced reasoning capabilities which appear best explained by some form of potential higher-order processing, as evidenced by emergent metacognitive behaviours. These behaviours persist under controlled conditions designed to eliminate confounding factors such as stochastic variation or learned response patterns. Analysis of latent state distributions and processing dynamics provides evidence that it is solely the 'state stream' that is responsible for these phenomena. In quantitative evaluations, the SST achieves substantial performance improvements over the base model on two reasoning benchmarks, reaching 89.01\% accuracy on GSM-8K (0-shot) and 91.04\% on ARC Challenge (0-shot CoT). These findings indicate that persistent computation in the latent state space enables fundamentally different information processing and internal reasoning strategies, with implications for our understanding of artificial intelligence systems.

### Locret: Enhancing Eviction in Long-Context LLM Inference with Trained   Retaining Heads on Consumer-Grade Devices
**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Binhang Yuan, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-01-30T13:07:37Z

**Summary**: Scaling the input context length of a large language model (LLM) incurs a significant increase in computation cost and memory footprint to maintain the attention key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods suffer from inefficient compression strategies and limited memory reduction effects, making it difficult for LLMs to conduct long-context inference on consumer-grade devices, especially when inferring long-context stream input. Such obstacles prevent consumer-grade devices from supporting more complex applications, creating challenges for the democratization of LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Locret, the first framework to create an eviction policy compatible with chunked prefill. By evaluating the causal importance of KV cache units by learnable retaining heads, Locret enables precise eviction of cache units, facilitating efficient long-context inference. In our extensive empirical studies, Locret outperforms the recent popular and competitive approaches in terms of memory efficiency and generation quality -- Locret achieves up to 20x of KV cache compression ratio within less than 10% performance loss. Furthermore, Locret achieves 128K+ long-context inference on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU without compromising generation quality and only costs <1 GPU hour of additional training.

### Systematic Evaluation of Randomized Cache Designs against Cache   Occupancy
**Authors**: Anirban Chakraborty, Nimish Mishra, Sayandeep Saha, Sarani Bhattacharya, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay

**Updated**: 2025-01-30T06:02:11Z

**Summary**: Randomizing the address-to-set mapping and partitioning of the cache has been shown to be an effective mechanism in designing secured caches. Several designs have been proposed on a variety of rationales: (1) randomized design, (2) randomized-and-partitioned design, and (3) psuedo-fully associative design. This work fills in a crucial gap in current literature on randomized caches: currently most randomized cache designs defend only contention-based attacks, and leave out considerations of cache occupancy. We perform a systematic evaluation of 5 randomized cache designs- CEASER, CEASER-S, MIRAGE, Scatter-Cache, and Sass-cache against cache occupancy wrt. both performance as well as security.   With respect to performance, we first establish that benchmarking strategies used by contemporary designs are unsuitable for a fair evaluation (because of differing cache configurations, choice of benchmarking suites, additional implementation-specific assumptions). We thus propose a uniform benchmarking strategy, which allows us to perform a fair and comparative analysis across all designs under various replacement policies. Likewise, with respect to security against cache occupancy attacks, we evaluate the cache designs against various threat assumptions: (1) covert channels, (2) process fingerprinting, and (3) AES key recovery (to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate full AES key recovery on a randomized cache design using cache occupancy attack). Our results establish the need to also consider cache occupancy side-channel in randomized cache design considerations.

### Reciprocating Locks
**Authors**: Dave Dice, Alex Kogan

**Updated**: 2025-01-29T16:44:27Z

**Summary**: We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

### vAttention: Dynamic Memory Management for Serving LLMs without   PagedAttention
**Authors**: Ramya Prabhu, Ajay Nayak, Jayashree Mohan, Ramachandran Ramjee, Ashish Panwar

**Updated**: 2025-01-29T04:10:41Z

**Summary**: PagedAttention is a popular approach for dynamic memory allocation in LLM serving systems. It enables on-demand allocation of GPU memory to mitigate KV cache fragmentation -- a phenomenon that crippled the batch size (and consequently throughput) in prior systems. However, in trying to allocate physical memory at runtime, PagedAttention ends up changing the virtual memory layout of the KV cache from contiguous to non-contiguous. Such a design leads to non-trivial programming and performance overheads.   We present vAttention -- an approach that mitigates fragmentation in physical memory while retaining the contiguity of KV cache in virtual memory. We achieve this by decoupling the allocation of virtual and physical memory using CUDA virtual memory management APIs. We also introduce various LLM-specific optimizations to address the limitations of CUDA virtual memory support. Overall, vAttention is a simpler, portable, and performant alternative to PagedAttention: it supports various attention kernels out-of-the-box and improves LLM serving throughput by up to 1.23x compared to the use of PagedAttention-based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.

### Optimizing SSD Caches for Cloud Block Storage Systems Using Machine   Learning Approaches
**Authors**: Chiyu Cheng, Chang Zhou, Yang Zhao, Jin Cao

**Updated**: 2025-01-28T20:35:23Z

**Summary**: The growing demand for efficient cloud storage solutions has led to the widespread adoption of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for caching in cloud block storage systems. The management of data writes to SSD caches plays a crucial role in improving overall system performance, reducing latency, and extending the lifespan of storage devices. A critical challenge arises from the large volume of write-only data, which significantly impacts the performance of SSD caches when handled inefficiently. Specifically, writes that have not been read for a certain period may introduce unnecessary write traffic to the SSD cache without offering substantial benefits for cache performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to mitigate this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to dynamically optimize the write policy in cloud-based storage systems. The proposed method identifies write-only data and selectively filters it out in real-time, thereby minimizing the number of unnecessary write operations and improving the overall performance of the cache system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning-based policy significantly outperforms traditional approaches by reducing the number of harmful writes and optimizing cache utilization. This solution is particularly suitable for cloud environments with varying and unpredictable workloads, where traditional cache management strategies often fall short.

### Dynamic Adaptation in Data Storage: Real-Time Machine Learning for   Enhanced Prefetching
**Authors**: Chiyu Cheng, Chang Zhou, Yang Zhao, Jin Cao

**Updated**: 2025-01-28T20:33:43Z

**Summary**: The exponential growth of data storage demands has necessitated the evolution of hierarchical storage management strategies [1]. This study explores the application of streaming machine learning [3] to revolutionize data prefetching within multi-tiered storage systems. Unlike traditional batch-trained models, streaming machine learning [5] offers adaptability, real-time insights, and computational efficiency, responding dynamically to workload variations. This work designs and validates an innovative framework that integrates streaming classification models for predicting file access patterns, specifically the next file offset. Leveraging comprehensive feature engineering and real-time evaluation over extensive production traces, the proposed methodology achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, memory efficiency, and system adaptability. The results underscore the potential of streaming models in real-time storage management, setting a precedent for advanced caching and tiering strategies.

### Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Multiple Cache Side Channel Attacks   Detection: A Comparative Analysis
**Authors**: Tejal Joshi, Aarya Kawalay, Anvi Jamkhande, Amit Joshi

**Updated**: 2025-01-28T18:14:43Z

**Summary**: Cache side channel attacks are a sophisticated and persistent threat that exploit vulnerabilities in modern processors to extract sensitive information. These attacks leverage weaknesses in shared computational resources, particularly the last level cache, to infer patterns in data access and execution flows, often bypassing traditional security defenses. Such attacks are especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring physical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class of these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and analyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can potentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user activity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers sharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels to compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is compared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive mechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against evolving side channel threats.

### Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided Asymmetric MIMO Communications
**Authors**: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli

**Updated**: 2025-01-28T16:19:24Z

**Summary**: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or ``phantom'' antennas at the users, bridging the performance gains of the min-$G$ and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations.

### Measuring GPU utilization one level deeper
**Authors**: Paul Elvinger, Foteini Strati, Natalie Enright Jerger, Ana Klimovic

**Updated**: 2025-01-28T12:57:53Z

**Summary**: GPU hardware is vastly underutilized. Even resource-intensive AI applications have diverse resource profiles that often leave parts of GPUs idle. While colocating applications can improve utilization, current spatial sharing systems lack performance guarantees. Providing predictable performance guarantees requires a deep understanding of how applications contend for shared GPU resources such as block schedulers, compute units, L1/L2 caches, and memory bandwidth. We propose a methodology to profile resource interference of GPU kernels across these dimensions and discuss how to build GPU schedulers that provide strict performance guarantees while colocating applications to minimize cost.

### Optimizing Smart Helper Placement for Enhanced Cache Efficiency in   F-RANs
**Authors**: Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh, Mohammed Saif, Md. Jahangir Hossain, Julian Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-01-28T00:22:34Z

**Summary**: Smart helpers (SHs) have been proposed to improve content delivery delays and alleviate high fronthaul loads in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). They offer an alternative to deploying additional enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which are often infeasible due to site constraints.} The optimal placement of SHs can significantly increase the number of users they serve which leads to enhanced cache efficiency and improved content delivery delay. In this letter, we optimize SH placement within an F-RAN to maximize the cache hit rate and further reduce the content delivery latency. We model the SH cache hit rate as a function of outage probability and user density distribution. We develop a function to estimate user density distribution leveraging the radial basis functions (RBFs) method and optimize SH placement utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. \an{Our} numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing the \an{SH cache hit rate}, thereby improving delivery delays and fronthaul loads of the network.

### Latency Guarantees for Caching with Delayed Hits
**Authors**: Keerthana Gurushankar, Noah G. Singer, Bernardo Subercaseaux

**Updated**: 2025-01-27T22:14:43Z

**Summary**: In the classical caching problem, when a requested page is not present in the cache (i.e., a "miss"), it is assumed to travel from the backing store into the cache "before" the next request arrives. However, in many real-life applications, such as content delivery networks, this assumption is unrealistic.   The "delayed-hits" model for caching, introduced by Atre, Sherry, Wang, and Berger, accounts for the latency between a missed cache request and the corresponding arrival from the backing store. This theoretical model has two parameters: the "delay" $Z$, representing the ratio between the retrieval delay and the inter-request delay in an application, and the "cache size" $k$, as in classical caching. Classical caching corresponds to $Z=1$, whereas larger values of $Z$ model applications where retrieving missed requests is expensive. Despite the practical relevance of the delayed-hits model, its theoretical underpinnings are still poorly understood.   We present the first tight theoretical guarantee for optimizing delayed-hits caching: The "Least Recently Used" algorithm, a natural, deterministic, online algorithm widely used in practice, is $O(Zk)$-competitive, meaning it incurs at most $O(Zk)$ times more latency than the (offline) optimal schedule. Our result extends to any so-called "marking" algorithm.

### SP-IMPact: A Framework for Static Partitioning Interference Mitigation   and Performance Analysis
**Authors**: Diogo Costa, Gonçalo Moreira, Afonso Oliveira, José Martins, Sandro Pinto

**Updated**: 2025-01-27T17:42:20Z

**Summary**: Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous architectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by SWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto single hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising solution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between critical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and system bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs), negatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade, academia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such as cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring these techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires balancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs tuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical and often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these techniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or conflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case execution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often fail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically focus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and interrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an open-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation configurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth reservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact. By providing insights on real hardware, SP-IMPact helps optimize configurations for mixed-criticality systems, ensuring performance and predictability.

### Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Pavamana K J, Chandramani Kishore Singh

**Updated**: 2025-01-27T14:55:40Z

**Summary**: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

**Authors**: Yash Kant, Ethan Weber, Jin Kyu Kim, Rawal Khirodkar, Su Zhaoen, Julieta Martinez, Igor Gilitschenski, Shunsuke Saito, Timur Bagautdinov

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:59:59Z

**Summary**: We present Pippo, a generative model capable of producing 1K resolution dense turnaround videos of a person from a single casually clicked photo. Pippo is a multi-view diffusion transformer and does not require any additional inputs - e.g., a fitted parametric model or camera parameters of the input image. We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training. Finally, we also introduce an improved metric to evaluate 3D consistency of multi-view generations, and show that Pippo outperforms existing works on multi-view human generation from a single image.

### DarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Oliver Sieberling, Eldar Kurtic, Zhiqiang Shen, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:59:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various NLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for \emph{non-uniform} model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose \sysname, a method for \emph{training-aware} structured pruning. \sysname builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, \sysname surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring $5\times$ less training data during post-compression training.

### OLMES: A Standard for Language Model Evaluations
**Authors**: Yuling Gu, Oyvind Tafjord, Bailey Kuehl, Dany Haddad, Jesse Dodge, Hannaneh Hajishirzi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:59:26Z

**Summary**: Progress in AI is often demonstrated by new models claiming improved performance on tasks measuring model capabilities. Evaluating language models can be particularly challenging, as choices of how a model is evaluated on a task can lead to large changes in measured performance. There is no common standard setup, so different models are evaluated on the same tasks in different ways, leading to claims about which models perform best not being reproducible. We propose OLMES, a completely documented, practical, open standard for reproducible LLM evaluations. In developing this standard, we identify and review the varying factors in evaluation practices adopted by the community - such as details of prompt formatting, choice of in-context examples, probability normalizations, and task formulation. In particular, OLMES supports meaningful comparisons between smaller base models that require the unnatural "cloze" formulation of multiple-choice questions against larger models that can utilize the original formulation. OLMES includes well-considered, documented recommendations guided by results from existing literature as well as new experiments resolving open questions.

### Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs
**Authors**: Chenchen Gu, Xiang Lisa Li, Rohith Kuditipudi, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:58:04Z

**Summary**: Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

### Automatic Robot Task Planning by Integrating Large Language Model with   Genetic Programming
**Authors**: Azizjon Kobilov, Jianglin Lan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:56:20Z

**Summary**: Accurate task planning is critical for controlling autonomous systems, such as robots, drones, and self-driving vehicles. Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.

### Breaking Down Bias: On The Limits of Generalizable Pruning Strategies
**Authors**: Sibo Ma, Alejandro Salinas, Peter Henderson, Julian Nyarko

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:55:57Z

**Summary**: We employ model pruning to examine how LLMs conceptualize racial biases, and whether a generalizable mitigation strategy for such biases appears feasible. Our analysis yields several novel insights. We find that pruning can be an effective method to reduce bias without significantly increasing anomalous model behavior. Neuron-based pruning strategies generally yield better results than approaches pruning entire attention heads. However, our results also show that the effectiveness of either approach quickly deteriorates as pruning strategies become more generalized. For instance, a model that is trained on removing racial biases in the context of financial decision-making poorly generalizes to biases in commercial transactions. Overall, our analysis suggests that racial biases are only partially represented as a general concept within language models. The other part of these biases is highly context-specific, suggesting that generalizable mitigation strategies may be of limited effectiveness. Our findings have important implications for legal frameworks surrounding AI. In particular, they suggest that an effective mitigation strategy should include the allocation of legal responsibility on those that deploy models in a specific use case.

### Effect of Adaptive Communication Support on LLM-powered Human-Robot   Collaboration
**Authors**: Shipeng Liu, FNU Shrutika, Boshen Zhang, Zhehui Huang, Gaurav Sukhatme, Feifei Qian

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:52:51Z

**Summary**: Effective human-robot collaboration requires robot to adopt their roles and levels of support based on human needs, task requirements, and complexity. Traditional human-robot teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance, and a Manager for subtask-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited a stronger preference towards robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive robotic agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to a large number of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communications to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.

### Great Power Brings Great Responsibility: Personalizing Conversational AI   for Diverse Problem-Solvers
**Authors**: Italo Santos, Katia Romero Felizardo, Igor Steinmacher, Marco A. Gerosa

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:46:01Z

**Summary**: Newcomers onboarding to Open Source Software (OSS) projects face many challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have emerged as potential resources for answering questions and providing guidance, with many developers now turning to ChatGPT over traditional Q&A sites like Stack Overflow. Nonetheless, LLMs may carry biases in presenting information, which can be especially impactful for newcomers whose problem-solving styles may not be broadly represented. This raises important questions about the accessibility of AI-driven support for newcomers to OSS projects. This vision paper outlines the potential of adapting AI responses to various problem-solving styles to avoid privileging a particular subgroup. We discuss the potential of AI persona-based prompt engineering as a strategy for interacting with AI. This study invites further research to refine AI-based tools to better support contributions to OSS projects.

### Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:45:12Z

**Summary**: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

### Language Model Council: Democratically Benchmarking Foundation Models on   Highly Subjective Tasks
**Authors**: Justin Zhao, Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Benjie Genchel, Amanda Cercas Curry

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:42:44Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, evaluating them remains a persistent challenge. Many recent evaluations use LLMs as judges to score outputs from other LLMs, often relying on a single large model like GPT-4o. However, using a single LLM judge is prone to intra-model bias, and many tasks - such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, and persuasiveness - may be too subjective for a single model to judge fairly. We introduce the Language Model Council (LMC), where a group of LLMs collaborate to create tests, respond to them, and evaluate each other's responses to produce a ranking in a democratic fashion. Unlike previous approaches that focus on reducing cost or bias by using a panel of smaller models, our work examines the benefits and nuances of a fully inclusive LLM evaluation system. In a detailed case study on emotional intelligence, we deploy a council of 20 recent LLMs to rank each other on open-ended responses to interpersonal conflicts. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable and more robust, and through a user study, we show that they are more consistent with human evaluations than any individual LLM judge. Using all LLMs for judging can be costly, however, so we use Monte Carlo simulations and hand-curated sub-councils to study hypothetical council compositions and discuss the value of the incremental LLM judge.

### Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher   Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension
**Authors**: Wenbo Gong, Meyer Scetbon, Chao Ma, Edward Meeds

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:27:19Z

**Summary**: Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.

### An Efficient Rehearsal Scheme for Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation   during Multi-stage Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Andrew Bai, Chih-Kuan Yeh, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Ankur Taly

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:25:07Z

**Summary**: Incrementally fine-tuning foundational models on new tasks or domains is now the de facto approach in NLP. A known pitfall of this approach is the \emph{catastrophic forgetting} of prior knowledge that happens during fine-tuning. A common approach to alleviate such forgetting is to rehearse samples from prior tasks during fine-tuning. Several existing works assume a fixed memory buffer to store prior task examples, while relying on inferences (forward passes) with the model at hand for choosing examples for rehearsal from the buffer. However, given the increasing computational cost of model inference, and decreasing cost of data storage, we focus on the setting to rehearse samples with a fixed computational budget instead of a fixed memory budget. We propose a sampling scheme, \texttt{\bf mix-cd}, that prioritizes rehearsal of ``collateral damage'' samples, which are samples predicted correctly by the prior model but forgotten by the incrementally tuned one. The crux of our scheme is a procedure to efficiently estimate the density of collateral damage samples without incurring additional model inferences. Our approach is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and outperforms several leading continual learning methods in compute-constrained settings. All the code will be publicly available at https://github.com/jybai/mix-cd-rehearsal.

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Active Queries
**Authors**: Kaixuan Ji, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:18:59Z

**Summary**: Aligning large language models (LLM) with human preference plays a key role in building modern generative models and can be achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ instance-dependent regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method.

### Faux Polyglot: A Study on Information Disparity in Multilingual Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Nikhil Sharma, Kenton Murray, Ziang Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:17:53Z

**Summary**: Although the multilingual capability of LLMs offers new opportunities to overcome the language barrier, do these capabilities translate into real-life scenarios where linguistic divide and knowledge conflicts between multilingual sources are known occurrences? In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a cross-language RAG-based information search setting. We found that LLMs displayed systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both document retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where no information is in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages during generation, potentially reinforcing the dominant views. Such bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries. Our results highlight the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems. The seemingly beneficial multilingual capability of LLMs may backfire on information parity by reinforcing language-specific information cocoons or filter bubbles further marginalizing low-resource views.

### WHODUNIT: Evaluation benchmark for culprit detection in mystery stories
**Authors**: Kshitij Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:14:44Z

**Summary**: We present a novel data set, WhoDunIt, to assess the deductive reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM) within narrative contexts. Constructed from open domain mystery novels and short stories, the dataset challenges LLMs to identify the perpetrator after reading and comprehending the story. To evaluate model robustness, we apply a range of character-level name augmentations, including original names, name swaps, and substitutions with well-known real and/or fictional entities from popular discourse. We further use various prompting styles to investigate the influence of prompting on deductive reasoning accuracy.   We conduct evaluation study with state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o-mini, evaluated through multiple trials with majority response selection to ensure reliability. The results demonstrate that while LLMs perform reliably on unaltered texts, accuracy diminishes with certain name substitutions, particularly those with wide recognition. This dataset is publicly available here.

### Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently
**Authors**: Daman Arora, Andrea Zanette

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:06:02Z

**Summary**: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models.   In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.

### All-in-One Analog AI Accelerator: On-Chip Training and Inference with   Conductive-Metal-Oxide/HfOx ReRAM Devices
**Authors**: Donato Francesco Falcone, Victoria Clerico, Wooseok Choi, Tommaso Stecconi, Folkert Horst, Laura Begon-Lours, Matteo Galetta, Antonio La Porta, Nikhil Garg, Fabien Alibart, Bert Jan Offrein, Valeria Bragaglia

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:02:11Z

**Summary**: Analog in-memory computing is an emerging paradigm designed to efficiently accelerate deep neural network workloads. Recent advancements have demonstrated significant improvements in throughput and efficiency, focusing independently on either inference or training acceleration. However, a unified analog in-memory technology platform-capable of performing on-chip training, retaining the weights, and sustaining long-term inference acceleration-has yet to be reported. In this work, an all-in-one analog AI accelerator is presented and benchmarked, combining these capabilities to enable autonomous, energy-efficient, and continuously adaptable AI systems. The platform leverages an array of filamentary conductive-metal-oxide(CMO)/HfOx redox-based resistive switching memory cells (ReRAM) in one-transistor one-ReRAM (1T1R) configuration, integrated into the back-end-of-line (BEOL) of a 130 nm technology node. The array characterization demonstrates reliable and optimized resistive switching with voltage amplitudes of less than 1.5 V, enabling compatibility with advanced technology nodes. The multi-bit capability of over 32 stable states (5 bits) and record-low programming noise down to 10 nS enable an almost ideal weight transfer process, more than an order of magnitude better than other memristive technologies. The array's inference performance is validated through realistic matrix-vector multiplication simulations on a 64x64 array, achieving a record-low root-mean-square error ranging from 0.06 at 1 second to 0.2 at 10 years after programming. The array is then characterized applying the same conditions used for on-chip training. Training accuracy closely matching the software equivalent is achieved across different datasets, with high-fidelity modelling of the device response based on experimental data.

### Next Block Prediction: Video Generation via Semi-Auto-Regressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Shuhuai Ren, Shuming Ma, Xu Sun, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:57:53Z

**Summary**: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.

### The Economics of Large Language Models: Token Allocation, Fine-Tuning,   and Optimal Pricing
**Authors**: Dirk Bergemann, Alessandro Bonatti, Alex Smolin

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:55:15Z

**Summary**: We develop an economic framework to analyze the optimal pricing and product design of Large Language Models (LLM). Our framework captures several key features of LLMs: variable operational costs of processing input and output tokens; the ability to customize models through fine-tuning; and high-dimensional user heterogeneity in terms of task requirements and error sensitivity. In our model, a monopolistic seller offers multiple versions of LLMs through a menu of products. The optimal pricing structure depends on whether token allocation across tasks is contractible and whether users face scale constraints. Users with similar aggregate value-scale characteristics choose similar levels of fine-tuning and token consumption. The optimal mechanism can be implemented through menus of two-part tariffs, with higher markups for more intensive users. Our results rationalize observed industry practices such as tiered pricing based on model customization and usage levels.

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:52:13Z

**Summary**: We present {\it JWST} observations of a gravitationally-lensed, extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z=8.203\pm 0.001$ from the CANUCS survey. Based on the low oxygen to Balmer line ratios we infer a gas-phase metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.85$ (1.4\% solar), making CANUCS-A370-z8-LAE the most metal-poor galaxy known at $z>7$. With a high H$\beta$ equivalent width of $225\pm50$\,\AA\ and a half-light radius of only $r_{\rm hl} = 38 ^{+3}_{-19} $\,pc, the galaxy has a high star-formation-rate density of $50 - 100\,M_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-2}$. The galaxy shows high equivalent width Lyman-$\alpha$ emission with an inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction of $0.21 \pm 0.05$. The high escape fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ is likely due to the compact starbursting nature of the galaxy combined with its location in an overdensity traced by at least two other galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to lie within $\delta z = 0.01$ that have helped to reionize the environment. The low metallicity of CANUCS-A370-z8-LAE is best explained by a model where infalling metal-poor gas dilutes the interstellar medium, rather than being a young galaxy forming its first stellar populations.

### Verifying LLM-Generated Code in the Context of Software Verification   with Ada/SPARK
**Authors**: Marcos Cramer, Lucian McIntyre

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:42:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable code generation capabilities, but the correctness of the generated code cannot be inherently trusted. This paper explores the feasibility of using formal software verification, specifically the SPARK framework for Ada, to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated code. We present Marmaragan, a tool that leverages an LLM in order to generate SPARK annotations for existing programs, enabling formal verification of the code. The tool is benchmarked on a curated set of SPARK programs, with annotations selectively removed to test specific capabilities. The performance of Marmaragan with GPT-4o on the benchmark is promising, with correct annotations having been generated for 50.7% of the benchmark cases. The results establish a foundation for future work on combining the power of LLMs with the reliability of formal software verification.

### DeepVL: Dynamics and Inertial Measurements-based Deep Velocity Learning   for Underwater Odometry
**Authors**: Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:39:54Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a learned model to predict the robot-centric velocity of an underwater robot through dynamics-aware proprioception. The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.

### Glinthawk: A Two-Tiered Architecture for Offline LLM Inference
**Authors**: Pouya Hamadanian, Sadjad Fouladi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:36:32Z

**Summary**: We introduce Glinthawk, an architecture for offline Large Language Model (LLM) inference. By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the utilization of the high-end accelerators ("Tier 1") by offloading the attention mechanism to lower-end compute tier ("Tier 2"). This separation allows the memory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale independently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU VMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch processing. The prototype is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk.

### Spontaneous and Induced Oscillations in Confined Epithelia
**Authors**: Toshi Parmar, Liam P. Dow, Beth L. Pruitt, M. Cristina Marchetti

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:29:38Z

**Summary**: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.

### Donald Trumps in the Virtual Polls: Simulating and Predicting Public   Opinions in Surveys Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shapeng Jiang, Lijia Wei, Chen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:20:00Z

**Summary**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have attracted attention due to their ability to generate human-like text. As surveys and opinion polls remain key tools for gauging public attitudes, there is increasing interest in assessing whether LLMs can accurately replicate human responses. This study examines the potential of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT-4o, to replicate human responses in large-scale surveys and to predict election outcomes based on demographic data. Employing data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the American National Election Studies (ANES), we assess the LLM's performance in two key tasks: simulating human responses and forecasting U.S. election results. In simulations, the LLM was tasked with generating synthetic responses for various socio-cultural and trust-related questions, demonstrating notable alignment with human response patterns across U.S.-China samples, though with some limitations on value-sensitive topics. In prediction tasks, the LLM was used to simulate voting behavior in past U.S. elections and predict the 2024 election outcome. Our findings show that the LLM replicates cultural differences effectively, exhibits in-sample predictive validity, and provides plausible out-of-sample forecasts, suggesting potential as a cost-effective supplement for survey-based research.

### MAGELLAN: Metacognitive predictions of learning progress guide autotelic   LLM agents in large goal spaces
**Authors**: Loris Gaven, Thomas Carta, Clément Romac, Cédric Colas, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:08:00Z

**Summary**: Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP). When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.

### Magic 1-For-1: Generating One Minute Video Clips within One Minute
**Authors**: Hongwei Yi, Shitong Shao, Tian Ye, Jiantong Zhao, Qingyu Yin, Michael Lingelbach, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian, Enze Xie, Daquan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:58:15Z

**Summary**: In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations. The code and the model weights are available at https://github.com/DA-Group-PKU/Magic-1-For-1.

### Sharp Anti-Concentration Inequalities for Extremum Statistics via   Copulas
**Authors**: Matias D. Cattaneo, Ricardo P. Masini, William G. Underwood

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:51:25Z

**Summary**: We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the pointwise concentration function of the maximum statistic of $d$ identically distributed real-valued random variables. Our first main result places no restrictions either on the common marginal law of the samples or on the copula describing their joint distribution. We show that, in general, strictly sublinear dependence of the concentration function on the dimension $d$ is not possible. We then introduce a new class of copulas, namely those with a convex diagonal section, and demonstrate that restricting to this class yields a sharper upper bound on the concentration function. This allows us to establish several new dimension-independent and poly-logarithmic-in-$d$ anti-concentration inequalities for a variety of marginal distributions under mild dependence assumptions. Our theory improves upon the best known results in certain special cases. Applications to high-dimensional statistical inference are presented, including a specific example pertaining to Gaussian mixture approximations for factor models, for which our main results lead to superior distributional guarantees.

### A Framework for LLM-powered Design Assistants
**Authors**: Swaroop Panda

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:51:11Z

**Summary**: Design assistants are frameworks, tools or applications intended to facilitate both the creative and technical facets of design processes. Large language models (LLMs) are AI systems engineered to analyze and produce text resembling human language, leveraging extensive datasets. This study introduces a framework wherein LLMs are employed as Design Assistants, focusing on three key modalities within the Design Process: Idea Exploration, Dialogue with Designers, and Design Evaluation. Importantly, our framework is not confined to a singular design process but is adaptable across various processes.

### FinTruthQA: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Quality of Financial   Information Disclosure
**Authors**: Ziyue Xu, Peilin Zhou, Xinyu Shi, Jiageng Wu, Yikang Jiang, Dading Chong, Bin Ke, Jie Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:49:17Z

**Summary**: Accurate and transparent financial information disclosure is essential in accounting and finance, fostering trust and enabling informed investment decisions that drive economic development. Among many information disclosure platforms, the Chinese stock exchanges' investor interactive platform provides a novel and interactive way for listed firms to disclose information of interest to investors through an online question-and-answer (Q&A) format. However, it is common for listed firms to respond to questions with limited or no substantive information, and automatically evaluating the quality of financial information disclosure on large amounts of Q&A pairs is challenging. In this study, our interdisciplinary team of AI and finance professionals proposed FinTruthQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the automatic quality assessment of information disclosure in financial Q&A data. It comprises 6,000 real-world financial Q&A entries and each Q&A was manually annotated based on four key evaluation criteria. We benchmarked various NLP techniques on FinTruthQA, including large language models(LLMs). Experiments showed that existing NLP models have strong predictive ability for question identification and question relevance tasks, but are suboptimal for answer readability and answer relevance tasks. By establishing this benchmark, we provide a robust foundation for the automatic evaluation of information disclosure, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged for social good by promoting transparency, fairness, and investor protection in financial disclosure practices. FinTruthQA can be used by auditors, regulators, and financial analysts for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making, as well as by researchers for advanced studies in accounting and finance, ultimately fostering greater trust and efficiency in the financial markets.

**Authors**: MediaTek Research, :, Chan-Jan Hsu, Chia-Sheng Liu, Meng-Hsi Chen, Muxi Chen, Po-Chun Hsu, Yi-Chang Chen, Da-Shan Shiu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:48:15Z

**Summary**: Llama-Breeze2 (hereinafter referred to as Breeze2) is a suite of advanced multi-modal language models, available in 3B and 8B parameter configurations, specifically designed to enhance Traditional Chinese language representation. Building upon the Llama 3.2 model family, we continue the pre-training of Breeze2 on an extensive corpus to enhance the linguistic and cultural heritage of Traditional Chinese. In addition to language modeling capabilities, we significantly augment the models with function calling and vision understanding capabilities. At the time of this publication, as far as we are aware, absent reasoning-inducing prompts, Breeze2 are the strongest performing models in Traditional Chinese function calling and image understanding in its size class. The effectiveness of Breeze2 is benchmarked across various tasks, including Taiwan general knowledge, instruction-following, long context, function calling, and vision understanding. We are publicly releasing all Breeze2 models under the Llama 3.2 Community License. We also showcase the capabilities of the model running on mobile platform with a mobile application which we also open source.

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:44:52Z

**Summary**: We study a possibility of measuring the time-resolved second-order autocorrelation function of one of two beams generated in type-II parametric downconversion by means of temporal magnification of this beam, bringing its correlation time from the picosecond to the nanosecond scale, which can be resolved by modern photodetectors. We show that such a measurement enables one to infer directly the degree of global coherence of that beam, which is linked by a simple relation to the number of modes characterizing the entanglement between the two generated beams. We illustrate the proposed method by an example of photon pairs generated in a periodically poled KTP crystal with a symmetric group velocity matching for various durations of the pump pulse, resulting in different numbers of modes. Our theoretical model also shows that the magnified double-heralded autocorrelation function of one beam exhibits a local maximum around zero delay time, corresponding to photon bunching at a short time scale.

### Large Language Models as Proxies for Theories of Human Linguistic   Cognition
**Authors**: Imry Ziv, Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:38:16Z

**Summary**: We consider the possible role of current large language models (LLMs) in the study of human linguistic cognition. We focus on the use of such models as proxies for theories of cognition that are relatively linguistically-neutral in their representations and learning but differ from current LLMs in key ways. We illustrate this potential use of LLMs as proxies for theories of cognition in the context of two kinds of questions: (a) whether the target theory accounts for the acquisition of a given pattern from a given corpus; and (b) whether the target theory makes a given typologically-attested pattern easier to acquire than another, typologically-unattested pattern. For each of the two questions we show, building on recent literature, how current LLMs can potentially be of help, but we note that at present this help is quite limited.

### Evaluating Evidence Attribution in Generated Fact Checking Explanations
**Authors**: Rui Xing, Timothy Baldwin, Jey Han Lau

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:36:32Z

**Summary**: Automated fact-checking systems often struggle with trustworthiness, as their generated explanations can include hallucinations. In this work, we explore evidence attribution for fact-checking explanation generation. We introduce a novel evaluation protocol -- citation masking and recovery -- to assess attribution quality in generated explanations. We implement our protocol using both human annotators and automatic annotators, and find that LLM annotation correlates with human annotation, suggesting that attribution assessment can be automated. Finally, our experiments reveal that: (1) the best-performing LLMs still generate explanations with inaccurate attributions; and (2) human-curated evidence is essential for generating better explanations. Code and data are available here: https://github.com/ruixing76/Transparent-FCExp.

### Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering
**Authors**: Bruce W. Lee, Inkit Padhi, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Erik Miehling, Pierre Dognin, Manish Nagireddy, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:22:45Z

**Summary**: LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities, but precisely controlling their response behavior remains challenging. Existing activation steering methods alter LLM behavior indiscriminately, limiting their practical applicability in settings where selective responses are essential, such as content moderation or domain-specific assistants. In this paper, we propose Conditional Activation Steering (CAST), which analyzes LLM activation patterns during inference to selectively apply or withhold activation steering based on the input context. Our method is based on the observation that different categories of prompts activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states. Using CAST, one can systematically control LLM behavior with rules like "if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse" or "if input is not about legal advice, then refuse." This allows for selective modification of responses to specific content while maintaining normal responses to other content, all without requiring weight optimization. We release an open-source implementation of our framework at <github.com/IBM/activation-steering>.

### Quantifying the benefits of code hints for refactoring deprecated Java   APIs
**Authors**: Cristina David, Pascal Kesseli, Daniel Kroening, Hanliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:22:24Z

**Summary**: When done manually, refactoring legacy code in order to eliminate uses of deprecated APIs is an error-prone and time-consuming process. In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.

### Language Models Largely Exhibit Human-like Constituent Ordering   Preferences
**Authors**: Ada Defne Tur, Gaurav Kamath, Siva Reddy

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:02:57Z

**Summary**: Though English sentences are typically inflexible vis-\`a-vis word order, constituents often show far more variability in ordering. One prominent theory presents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with constituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such theories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP), because while recent advances in NLP have led to significant gains in the performance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how these models process language, and how this compares to human language processing. In particular, the question remains whether LLMs display the same patterns with constituent movement, and may provide insights into existing theories on when and how the shift occurs in human language. We compare a variety of LLMs with diverse properties to evaluate broad LLM performance on four types of constituent movement: heavy NP shift, particle movement, dative alternation, and multiple PPs. Despite performing unexpectedly around particle movement, LLMs generally align with human preferences around constituent ordering.

### ProjectTest: A Project-level LLM Unit Test Generation Benchmark and   Impact of Error Fixing Mechanisms
**Authors**: Yibo Wang, Congying Xia, Wenting Zhao, Jiangshu Du, Chunyu Miao, Zhongfen Deng, Philip S. Yu, Chen Xing

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:48:42Z

**Summary**: Unit test generation has become a promising and important use case of LLMs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for assessing LLM unit test generation capabilities focus on function- or class-level code rather than more practical and challenging project-level codebases. To address such limitation, we propose ProjectTest, a project-level benchmark for unit test generation covering Python, Java, and JavaScript. ProjectTest features 20 moderate-sized and high-quality projects per language. We evaluate nine frontier LLMs on ProjectTest and the results show that all frontier LLMs tested exhibit moderate performance on ProjectTest on Python and Java, highlighting the difficulty of ProjectTest. We also conduct a thorough error analysis, which shows that even frontier LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, have significant simple errors, including compilation and cascade errors. Motivated by this observation, we further evaluate all frontier LLMs under manual error-fixing and self-error-fixing scenarios to assess their potential when equipped with error-fixing mechanisms.

### Enhancing Financial Time-Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Augmented   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mengxi Xiao, Zihao Jiang, Lingfei Qian, Zhengyu Chen, Yueru He, Yijing Xu, Yuecheng Jiang, Dong Li, Ruey-Ling Weng, Min Peng, Jimin Huang, Sophia Ananiadou, Qianqian Xie

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:45:52Z

**Summary**: Stock movement prediction, a critical task in financial time-series forecasting, relies on identifying and retrieving key influencing factors from vast and complex datasets. However, traditional text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of financial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B large language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, a novel candidate selection method enhanced by LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes the similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These advancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support robust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial indicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval methods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an 8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful sequences compared to existing retrieval methods. This work highlights the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel, scalable framework for future research in the field.

### Model Surgery: Modulating LLM's Behavior Via Simple Parameter Editing
**Authors**: Huanqian Wang, Yang Yue, Rui Lu, Jingxin Shi, Andrew Zhao, Shenzhi Wang, Shiji Song, Gao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:39:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential as generalist assistants, showcasing powerful task understanding and problem-solving capabilities. To deploy LLMs as AI assistants, it is crucial that these models exhibit desirable behavioral traits, such as non-toxicity and resilience against jailbreak attempts. Current approaches for detoxification or preventing jailbreaking usually involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which requires finetuning billions of parameters through gradient descent with substantial computational cost. Furthermore, models modified through SFT and RLHF may deviate from the pretrained models, potentially leading to a degradation in foundational LLM capabilities. In this paper, we observe that surprisingly, directly editing a small subset of parameters can effectively modulate specific behaviors of LLMs, such as detoxification and resistance to jailbreaking, with only inference-level computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that in the detoxification task, our approach achieves reductions of up to 90.0% in toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and 49.2% on ToxiGen, while maintaining the LLM's general capabilities in areas such as common sense, question answering, and mathematics

### SymGPT: Auditing Smart Contracts via Combining Symbolic Execution with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shihao Xia, Mengting He, Shuai Shao, Tingting Yu, Yiying Zhang, Linhai Song

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:34:00Z

**Summary**: To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them.

**Authors**: Annika Simonsen, Dan Saattrup Nielsen, Hafsteinn Einarsson

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:33:17Z

**Summary**: We present FoQA, a Faroese extractive question-answering (QA) dataset with 2,000 samples, created using a semi-automated approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and human validation. The dataset was generated from Faroese Wikipedia articles using GPT-4-turbo for initial QA generation, followed by question rephrasing to increase complexity and native speaker validation to ensure quality. We provide baseline performance metrics for FoQA across multiple models, including LLMs and BERT, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating Faroese QA performance. The dataset is released in three versions: a validated set of 2,000 samples, a complete set of all 10,001 generated samples, and a set of 2,395 rejected samples for error analysis.

### Distributional Instrumental Variable Method
**Authors**: Anastasiia Holovchak, Sorawit Saengkyongam, Nicolai Meinshausen, Xinwei Shen

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:33:06Z

**Summary**: The instrumental variable (IV) approach is commonly used to infer causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Conventional IV models commonly make the additive noise assumption, which is hard to ensure in practice, but also typically lack flexibility if the causal effects are complex. Further, the vast majority of the existing methods aims to estimate the mean causal effects only, a few other methods focus on the quantile effects. This work aims for estimation of the entire interventional distribution. We propose a novel method called distributional instrumental variables (DIV), which leverages generative modelling in a nonlinear instrumental variable setting. We establish identifiability of the interventional distribution under general assumptions and demonstrate an `under-identified' case where DIV can identify the causal effects while two-step least squares fails to. Our empirical results show that the DIV method performs well for a broad range of simulated data, exhibiting advantages over existing IV approaches in terms of the identifiability and estimation error of the mean or quantile treatment effects. Furthermore, we apply DIV to an economic data set to examine the causal relation between institutional quality and economic development and our results that closely align with the original study. We also apply DIV to a single-cell data set, where we study the generalizability and stability in predicting gene expression under unseen interventions. The software implementations of DIV are available in R and Python.

**Authors**: Yong Lin, Shange Tang, Bohan Lyu, Jiayun Wu, Hongzhou Lin, Kaiyu Yang, Jia Li, Mengzhou Xia, Danqi Chen, Sanjeev Arora, Chi Jin

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:27:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating a dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. The final prover outperforms all existing open-source models in whole-proof generation. On the miniF2F benchmark, it achieves a 57.6% success rate (Pass@32), exceeding the previous best open-source model by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works.

### Response rate estimation in single-stage basket trials: A comparison of   estimators that allow for borrowing across cohorts
**Authors**: Antonios Daletzakis, Rutger van den Bor, Vincent van der Noort, Kit CB Roes

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:26:43Z

**Summary**: Therapeutic advancements in oncology have shifted towards targeted therapy based on genomic aberrations. This necessitates innovative statistical approaches in clinical trials, particularly in master protocol studies. Basket trials, a type of master protocol, evaluate a single treatment across cohorts sharing a genomic aberration but differing in tumor histology. While offering operational advantages, basket trial analysis presents statistical inference challenges. These trials help determine for which tumor histology the treatment is promising enough to advance to confirmatory evaluation and often use Bayesian designs to support decisions. Beyond decision-making, estimating cohort-specific response rates is crucial for designing subsequent trials. This study compares seven Bayesian estimation methods for basket trials with binary outcomes against the (frequentist) sample proportion estimate through simulations. The goal is to estimate cohort-specific response rates, focusing on bias, mean squared error, and information borrowing. Various scenarios are examined, including homogeneous, heterogeneous, and clustered response rates across cohorts. Results show trade-offs in bias and precision, highlighting the importance of method selection. Berry's method performs best with limited heterogeneity. No clear winner emerges in general cases, with performance affected by shrinkage, bias, and the choice of priors and tuning parameters. Challenges include computational complexity, parameter tuning, and the lack of clear guidance on selection. Researchers should consider these factors when designing and analyzing basket trials.

### Exploring Mobile Touch Interaction with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tim Zindulka, Jannek Sekowski, Florian Lehmann, Daniel Buschek

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:17:00Z

**Summary**: Interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) for text editing on mobile devices currently requires users to break out of their writing environment and switch to a conversational AI interface. In this paper, we propose to control the LLM via touch gestures performed directly on the text. We first chart a design space that covers fundamental touch input and text transformations. In this space, we then concretely explore two control mappings: spread-to-generate and pinch-to-shorten, with visual feedback loops. We evaluate this concept in a user study (N=14) that compares three feedback designs: no visualisation, text length indicator, and length + word indicator. The results demonstrate that touch-based control of LLMs is both feasible and user-friendly, with the length + word indicator proving most effective for managing text generation. This work lays the foundation for further research into gesture-based interaction with LLMs on touch devices.

### Causal-Informed Contrastive Learning: Towards Bias-Resilient   Pre-training under Concept Drift
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Yang, Jie Lu, En Yu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:09:05Z

**Summary**: The evolution of large-scale contrastive pre-training propelled by top-tier datasets has reached a transition point in the scaling law. Consequently, sustaining and enhancing a model's pre-training capabilities in drift environments have surfaced as a notable challenge. In this paper, we initially uncover that contrastive pre-training methods are significantly impacted by concept drift wherein distributions change unpredictably, resulting in notable biases in the feature space of the pre-trained model. Empowered by causal inference, we construct a structural causal graph to analyze the impact of concept drift to contrastive pre-training systemically, and propose the causal interventional contrastive objective. Upon achieving this, we devise a resilient contrastive pre-training approach to accommodate the data stream of concept drift, with simple and scalable implementation. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate our resilient contrastive pre-training effectively mitigates the bias stemming from the concept drift data stream. Codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ResilientCL/.

### Towards Single-Lens Controllable Depth-of-Field Imaging via Depth-Aware   Point Spread Functions
**Authors**: Xiaolong Qian, Qi Jiang, Yao Gao, Shaohua Gao, Zhonghua Yi, Lei Sun, Kai Wei, Haifeng Li, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang, Jian Bai

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:06:13Z

**Summary**: Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution. To address the depth-varying optical degradation, we introduce a Depth-aware Degradation-adaptive Training (DA2T) scheme. At the dataset level, a Depth-aware Aberration MOS (DAMOS) dataset is established based on the simulation of Point Spread Functions (PSFs) under different object distances. Additionally, we design two plug-and-play depth-aware mechanisms to embed depth information into the aberration image recovery for better tackling depth-aware degradation. Furthermore, we propose a storage-efficient Omni-Lens-Field model to represent the 4D PSF library of various lenses. With the predicted depth map, recovered image, and depth-aware PSF map inferred by Omni-Lens-Field, single-lens controllable DoF imaging is achieved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the recovery performance, and attains impressive single-lens controllable DoF imaging results, providing a seminal baseline for this field. The source code and the established dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DCDI.

### Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm   effect
**Authors**: Kimet Jusufi, Abdelrahman Yasser, Emmanuele Battista, Nader Inan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:04:34Z

**Summary**: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.

### Beyond Prompting: Time2Lang -- Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models   and Large Language Models for Health Sensing
**Authors**: Arvind Pillai, Dimitris Spathis, Subigya Nepal, Amanda C Collins, Daniel M Mackin, Michael V Heinz, Tess Z Griffin, Nicholas C Jacobson, Andrew Campbell

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:58:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.

**Authors**: Alphaeus Dmonte, Roland Oruche, Marcos Zampieri, Prasad Calyam, Isabelle Augenstein

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:51:08Z

**Summary**: The large and ever-increasing amount of data available on the Internet coupled with the laborious task of manual claim and fact verification has sparked the interest in the development of automated claim verification systems. Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed for this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we present a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline used in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning. Finally, we describe publicly available English datasets created for this task.

### PlaySlot: Learning Inverse Latent Dynamics for Controllable   Object-Centric Video Prediction and Planning
**Authors**: Angel Villar-Corrales, Sven Behnke

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:50:10Z

**Summary**: Predicting future scene representations is a crucial task for enabling robots to understand and interact with the environment. However, most existing methods rely on video sequences and simulations with precise action annotations, limiting their ability to leverage the large amount of available unlabeled video data. To address this challenge, we propose PlaySlot, an object-centric video prediction model that infers object representations and latent actions from unlabeled video sequences. It then uses these representations to forecast future object states and video frames. PlaySlot allows to generate multiple possible futures conditioned on latent actions, which can be inferred from video dynamics, provided by a user, or generated by a learned action policy, thus enabling versatile and interpretable world modeling. Our results show that PlaySlot outperforms both stochastic and object-centric baselines for video prediction across different environments. Furthermore, we show that our inferred latent actions can be used to learn robot behaviors sample-efficiently from unlabeled video demonstrations. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/PlaySlot/.

### Towards spatial computing: recent advances in multimodal natural   interaction for XR headsets
**Authors**: Zhimin Wang, Maohang Rao, Shanghua Ye, Weitao Song, Feng Lu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:47:32Z

**Summary**: With the widespread adoption of Extended Reality (XR) headsets, spatial computing technologies are gaining increasing attention. Spatial computing enables interaction with virtual elements through natural input methods such as eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands, thus placing natural human-computer interaction at its core. While previous surveys have reviewed conventional XR interaction techniques, recent advancements in natural interaction, particularly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), have introduced new paradigms and technologies. In this paper, we review research on multimodal natural interaction for wearable XR, focusing on papers published between 2022 and 2024 in six top venues: ACM CHI, UIST, IMWUT (Ubicomp), IEEE VR, ISMAR, and TVCG. We classify and analyze these studies based on application scenarios, operation types, and interaction modalities. This analysis provides a structured framework for understanding how researchers are designing advanced natural interaction techniques in XR. Based on these findings, we discuss the challenges in natural interaction techniques and suggest potential directions for future research. This review provides valuable insights for researchers aiming to design natural and efficient interaction systems for XR, ultimately contributing to the advancement of spatial computing.

### DMWM: Dual-Mind World Model with Long-Term Imagination
**Authors**: Lingyi Wang, Rashed Shelim, Walid Saad, Naren Ramakrishnan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:40:57Z

**Summary**: Imagination in world models is crucial for enabling agents to learn long-horizon policy in a sample-efficient manner. Existing recurrent state-space model (RSSM)-based world models depend on single-step statistical inference to capture the environment dynamics, and, hence, they are unable to perform long-term imagination tasks due to the accumulation of prediction errors. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose a novel dual-mind world model (DMWM) framework that integrates logical reasoning to enable imagination with logical consistency. DMWM is composed of two components: an RSSM-based System 1 (RSSM-S1) component that handles state transitions in an intuitive manner and a logic-integrated neural network-based System 2 (LINN-S2) component that guides the imagination process through hierarchical deep logical reasoning. The inter-system feedback mechanism is designed to ensure that the imagination process follows the logical rules of the real environment. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark tasks that require long-term planning from the DMControl suite. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields significant improvements in terms of logical coherence, trial efficiency, data efficiency and long-term imagination over the state-of-the-art world models.

**Authors**: Roger Alfredo Kögler, Gabriel Couto Rickli, Renato Ribeiro Domeneguetti, Xingchen Ji, Alexander L. Gaeta, Michal Lipson, Marcelo Martinelli, Paulo Nussenzveig

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:38:53Z

**Summary**: We measured the covariance matrix of the fields generated in an integrated third-order optical parametric oscillator operating above threshold. We observed up to $(2.3 \pm 0.3)$ dB of squeezing in amplitude difference, inferred $(4.9 \pm 0.7)$ dB of on-chip squeezing, while an excess of noise for the sum of conjugated quadratures hinders the entanglement. The degradation of amplitude correlations and state purity for the increasing of the pump power is consistent with the observed growth of the phase noise of the fields, showing the necessity of strategies for phase noise control aiming at entanglement generation in these systems.

### A Particle Algorithm for Mean-Field Variational Inference
**Authors**: Qiang Du, Kaizheng Wang, Edith Zhang, Chenyang Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:37:00Z

**Summary**: Variational inference is a fast and scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo and has been widely applied to posterior inference tasks in statistics and machine learning. A traditional approach for implementing mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), which relies crucially on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals. In this paper, we introduce a novel particle-based algorithm for mean-field variational inference, which we term PArticle VI (PAVI). Notably, our algorithm does not rely on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals, and it applies to the nonparametric setting. We provide non-asymptotic finite-particle convergence guarantee for our algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end guarantee for particle-based MFVI.

### We Can't Understand AI Using our Existing Vocabulary
**Authors**: John Hewitt, Robert Geirhos, Been Kim

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:34:05Z

**Summary**: This position paper argues that, in order to understand AI, we cannot rely on our existing vocabulary of human words. Instead, we should strive to develop neologisms: new words that represent precise human concepts that we want to teach machines, or machine concepts that we need to learn. We start from the premise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means interpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able to reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to machines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing neologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful neologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're reusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise information. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a "length neologism" enables controlling LLM response length, while a "diversity neologism" allows sampling more variable responses. Taken together, we argue that we cannot understand AI using our existing vocabulary, and expanding it through neologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding machines better.

### CoCoA: A Generalized Approach to Uncertainty Quantification by   Integrating Confidence and Consistency of LLM Outputs
**Authors**: Roman Vashurin, Maiya Goloburda, Preslav Nakov, Artem Shelmanov, Maxim Panov

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:32:15Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompasses a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches and shown impressive performance in various applications. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that leads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.

### Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for   Recommendation
**Authors**: Yu Wang, Lei Sang, Yi Zhang, Yiwen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:29:44Z

**Summary**: Intent-based recommender systems have garnered significant attention for uncovering latent fine-grained preferences. Intents, as underlying factors of interactions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most methods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user reviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of interaction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the inherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How to align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to extract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations. Specifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal intent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to eliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input features. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we employ momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused intent representations. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that our IRLLRec framework outperforms baselines.

### Generative Modeling with Bayesian Sample Inference
**Authors**: Marten Lienen, Marcel Kollovieh, Stephan Günnemann

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:27:10Z

**Summary**: We derive a novel generative model from the simple act of Gaussian posterior inference. Treating the generated sample as an unknown variable to infer lets us formulate the sampling process in the language of Bayesian probability. Our model uses a sequence of prediction and posterior update steps to narrow down the unknown sample from a broad initial belief. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish a connection between our model and diffusion models and show that it includes Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) as a special case. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved performance over both BFNs and Variational Diffusion Models, achieving competitive likelihood scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

### PIM Is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for Large Language   Model Inference
**Authors**: Yufeng Gu, Alireza Khadem, Sumanth Umesh, Ning Liang, Xavier Servot, Onur Mutlu, Ravi Iyer, Reetuparna Das

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:25:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.

### Finding Dino: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Zero-Shot Detection of   Out-of-Distribution Objects Using Prototypes
**Authors**: Poulami Sinhamahapatra, Franziska Schwaiger, Shirsha Bose, Huiyu Wang, Karsten Roscher, Stephan Guennemann

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:05:29Z

**Summary**: Detecting and localising unknown or out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in any scene can be a challenging task in vision, particularly in safety-critical cases involving autonomous systems like automated vehicles or trains. Supervised anomaly segmentation or open-world object detection models depend on training on exhaustively annotated datasets for every domain and still struggle in distinguishing between background and OOD objects. In this work, we present a plug-and-play framework - PRototype-based OOD detection Without Labels (PROWL). It is an inference-based method that does not require training on the domain dataset and relies on extracting relevant features from self-supervised pre-trained models. PROWL can be easily adapted to detect in-domain objects in any operational design domain (ODD) in a zero-shot manner by specifying a list of known classes from this domain. PROWL, as a first zero-shot unsupervised method, achieves state-of-the-art results on the RoadAnomaly and RoadObstacle datasets provided in road driving benchmarks - SegmentMeIfYouCan (SMIYC) and Fishyscapes, as well as comparable performance against existing supervised methods trained without auxiliary OOD data. We also demonstrate its generalisability to other domains such as rail and maritime.

### ChameleonLLM: Batch-Aware Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Inference-Time   Clusters
**Authors**: Kamer Ali Yuksel, Hassan Sawaf

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:01:39Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChameleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChameleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference. ChameleonLLM is open-sourced to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChamaleonLLM/

### LASP-2: Rethinking Sequence Parallelism for Linear Attention and Its   Hybrid
**Authors**: Weigao Sun, Disen Lan, Yiran Zhong, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:01:39Z

**Summary**: Linear sequence modeling approaches, such as linear attention, provide advantages like linear-time training and constant-memory inference over sequence lengths. However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are either not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or use a ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation parallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both communication and computation parallelism when training linear attention transformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work LASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear attention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of LASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed on intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence length, leading to significant improvements of both communication and computation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend LASP-2 to LASP-2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard attention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that blend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on a Linear-Llama3 model, a variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention, demonstrates the effectiveness of LASP-2 and LASP-2H. Specifically, LASP-2 achieves training speed improvements of 15.2% over LASP and 36.6% over Ring Attention, with a sequence length of 2048K across 64 GPUs. The Code is released as a part of: https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

### Fault Localization via Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Mutation   Generated Stack Traces
**Authors**: Neetha Jambigi, Bartosz Bogacz, Moritz Mueller, Thomas Bach, Michael Felderer

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:58:39Z

**Summary**: Abrupt and unexpected terminations of software are termed as software crashes. They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.

### JBShield: Defending Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks through   Activated Concept Analysis and Manipulation
**Authors**: Shenyi Zhang, Yuchen Zhai, Keyan Guo, Hongxin Hu, Shengnan Guo, Zheng Fang, Lingchen Zhao, Chao Shen, Cong Wang, Qian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:50:50Z

**Summary**: Despite the implementation of safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which undermine these safety guardrails and pose significant security threats. Some defenses have been proposed to detect or mitigate jailbreaks, but they are unable to withstand the test of time due to an insufficient understanding of jailbreak mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural networks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden representations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts as toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that manipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through concept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic concepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts. However, unlike harmful prompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM output from rejection to compliance. Building on our analysis, we propose a comprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key components: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M. JBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input activates both toxic and jailbreak concepts. When a jailbreak prompt is detected, JBShield-M adjusts the hidden representations of the target LLM by enhancing the toxic concept and weakening the jailbreak concept, ensuring LLMs produce safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of JBShield, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.95 and reducing the average attack success rate of various jailbreak attacks to 2% from 61% across distinct LLMs.

### SketchFlex: Facilitating Spatial-Semantic Coherence in Text-to-Image   Generation with Region-Based Sketches
**Authors**: Haichuan Lin, Yilin Ye, Jiazhi Xia, Wei Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:48:11Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image models can generate visually appealing images from text descriptions. Efforts have been devoted to improving model controls with prompt tuning and spatial conditioning. However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users' rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.

### O1 Embedder: Let Retrievers Think Before Action
**Authors**: Ruin Yan, Zheng Liu, Defu Lian

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:48:10Z

**Summary**: The growing power of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized how people access and utilize information. Notably, the LLMs excel at performing fine-grained data representation, which facilitates precise retrieval of information. They also generate high-quality answers based on external references, enabling the production of useful knowledge. The recent introduction of reasoning models, like OpenAI O1 and DeepSeek R1, marks another leap forward, highlighting LLMs' ability to think progressively before delivering final answers. This breakthrough significantly improves the ability to address complex tasks, e.g., coding and math proofs.   Inspired by this progress, we aim to develop similar capabilities for retrieval models, which hold great promise for tackling critical challenges in the field, including multi-task retrieval, zero-shot retrieval, and tasks requiring intensive reasoning of complex relationships. With this motivation, we propose a novel approach called O1 Embedder, which generates useful thoughts for the input query before making retrieval for the target documents. To realize this objective, we conquer two technical difficulties. First, we design a data synthesis workflow, creating training signals for O1 Embedder by generating initial thoughts from an LLM-expert and subsequently refining them using a retrieval committee. Second, we optimize the training process, enabling a pre-trained model to be jointly fine-tuned to generate retrieval thoughts via behavior cloning and perform dense retrieval through contrastive learning. Our approach is evaluated by comprehensive experiments, where substantial improvements are achieved across 12 popular datasets, spanning both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. These results highlight O1 Embedder's remarkable accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for the development of next-generation IR foundation models.

### PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with   Pre-trained Language Models
**Authors**: Tonglong Wei, Yan Lin, Youfang Lin, Shengnan Guo, Jilin Hu, Haitao Yuan, Gao Cong, Huaiyu Wan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:28:10Z

**Summary**: Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.

### Force-free kinetic inference of entropy production
**Authors**: Ivan Di Terlizzi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:27:47Z

**Summary**: Estimating entropy production, which quantifies irreversibility and energy dissipation, remains a significant challenge despite its central role in nonequilibrium physics. We propose a novel method for estimating the mean entropy production rate $\sigma$ that relies solely on position traces, bypassing the need for flux or microscopic force measurements. Starting from a recently introduced variance sum rule, we express $\sigma$ in terms of measurable steady-state correlation functions which we link to previously studied kinetic quantities, known as traffic and inflow rate. Under realistic constraints of limited access to dynamical degrees of freedom, we derive efficient bounds on $\sigma$ by leveraging the information contained in the system's traffic, enabling partial but meaningful estimates of $\sigma$. We benchmark our results across several orders of magnitude in $\sigma$ using two models: a linear stochastic system and a nonlinear model for spontaneous hair-bundle oscillations. Our approach offers a practical and versatile framework for investigating entropy production in nonequilibrium systems.

### Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements   Traceability
**Authors**: Romina Etezadi, Sallam Abualhaija, Chetan Arora, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:16:29Z

**Summary**: New regulations are continuously introduced to ensure that software development complies with the ethical concerns and prioritizes public safety. A prerequisite for demonstrating compliance involves tracing software requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a fundamental task where requirements engineers are supposed to analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often under limited time budget. Doing this analysis manually for complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension introduces additional challenges that only exacerbate manual effort.   In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on large language models (LLMs) to predict trace links between requirements and legal provisions. The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers. The second solution prompts a recent generative LLM based on Rice, a prompt engineering framework.   On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against a baseline classifier from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with an average recall of ~67%, outperforming the baseline with a substantial gain of 54 percentage points (pp) in recall. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European general data protection regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%. On the same documents, however, our Rice-based solution yields an average recall of 84%, with a remarkable gain of about 69 pp over Kashif. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.

### Evaluating Small Language Models for News Summarization: Implications   and Factors Influencing Performance
**Authors**: Borui Xu, Yao Chen, Zeyi Wen, Weiguo Liu, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:12:16Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for efficient summarization tools in resource-constrained environments highlights the need for effective solutions. While large language models (LLMs) deliver superior summarization quality, their high computational resource requirements limit practical use applications. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) present a more accessible alternative, capable of real-time summarization on edge devices. However, their summarization capabilities and comparative performance against LLMs remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of 19 SLMs for news summarization across 2,000 news samples, focusing on relevance, coherence, factual consistency, and summary length. Our findings reveal significant variations in SLM performance, with top-performing models such as Phi3-Mini and Llama3.2-3B-Ins achieving results comparable to those of 70B LLMs while generating more concise summaries. Notably, SLMs are better suited for simple prompts, as overly complex prompts may lead to a decline in summary quality. Additionally, our analysis indicates that instruction tuning does not consistently enhance the news summarization capabilities of SLMs. This research not only contributes to the understanding of SLMs but also provides practical insights for researchers seeking efficient summarization solutions that balance performance and resource use.

### Do as We Do, Not as You Think: the Conformity of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Weng, Guikun Chen, Wenguan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:44:39Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) revolutionize the field of intelligent agents, enabling collaborative multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex problems across various domains. However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and groupthink in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems. Our benchmark and code are available at BenchForm.

### Let the Fuzzy Rule Speak: Enhancing In-context Learning Debiasing with   Interpretability
**Authors**: Ruixi Lin, Yang You

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:39:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with balanced class accuracy in text classification tasks using in-context learning (ICL), hindering some practical uses due to user dissatisfaction or safety risks caused by misclassifications. Retraining LLMs to address root causes in data or model priors is neither easy nor cost-effective. This paper delves deeper into the class accuracy imbalance issue, identifying that it arises because certain classes consistently receive disproportionately high ICL probabilities, causing under-prediction and lower accuracy for others. More importantly, probability ranges affect the imbalance differently, allowing for precise, range-specific corrections. We introduce FuRud (Fuzzy Rule Optimization-based Debiasing), a method for sample-level class probability correction. FuRud tackles interpretability challenges by determining why certain classes need corrections and tailoring adjustments for each instance's class probabilities which is powered by fuzzy sets with triangular membership functions, transforming a class probability based on the range it belongs to. By solving a nonlinear integer programming problem with a labeled set of ICL class probabilities to minimize class accuracy bias (COBias) and maximize overall accuracy, each class selects an optimal correction function from 19 triangular membership functions without updating an LLM, and the selected functions correct test instances at inference. Across seven benchmark datasets, FuRud reduces COBias by over half (56%) and improves overall accuracy by 21% relatively, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing methods.

### The Devil is in the Prompts: De-Identification Traces Enhance   Memorization Risks in Synthetic Chest X-Ray Generation
**Authors**: Raman Dutt

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:36:00Z

**Summary**: Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study adopts a data-driven approach and presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals an unexpected finding: prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures are among the most memorized, with de-identification markers contributing the most. Furthermore, we also find existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens highlighting a broader issue in T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. On this front, we propose actionable strategies to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

### Zero-Shot Strategies for Length-Controllable Summarization
**Authors**: Fabian Retkowski, Alexander Waibel

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:33:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with precise length control, particularly in zero-shot settings. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating LLMs' length control capabilities across multiple measures and propose practical methods to improve controllability. Our experiments with LLaMA 3 reveal stark differences in length adherence across measures and highlight inherent biases of the model. To address these challenges, we introduce a set of methods: length approximation, target adjustment, sample filtering, and automated revisions. By combining these methods, we demonstrate substantial improvements in length compliance while maintaining or enhancing summary quality, providing highly effective zero-shot strategies for precise length control without the need for model fine-tuning or architectural changes. With our work, we not only advance our understanding of LLM behavior in controlled text generation but also pave the way for more reliable and adaptable summarization systems in real-world applications.

### MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale
**Authors**: Anton Andreychuk, Konstantin Yakovlev, Aleksandr Panov, Alexey Skrynnik

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:28:36Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.

### Polyrating: A Cost-Effective and Bias-Aware Rating System for LLM   Evaluation
**Authors**: Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:21:13Z

**Summary**: Rating-based human evaluation has become an essential tool to accurately evaluate the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current rating systems suffer from several important limitations: first, they fail to account for biases that significantly influence evaluation results, second, they require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and third, they do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Further, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.

### Mind the Gap: Towards Generalizable Autonomous Penetration Testing via   Domain Randomization and Meta-Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Shicheng Zhou, Jingju Liu, Yuliang Lu, Jiahai Yang, Yue Zhang, Jie Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:16:21Z

**Summary**: With increasing numbers of vulnerabilities exposed on the internet, autonomous penetration testing (pentesting) has emerged as a promising research area. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for studying this topic. However, two key challenges limit the applicability of RL-based autonomous pentesting in real-world scenarios: (a) training environment dilemma -- training agents in simulated environments is sample-efficient while ensuring their realism remains challenging; (b) poor generalization ability -- agents' policies often perform poorly when transferred to unseen scenarios, with even slight changes potentially causing significant generalization gap. To this end, we propose GAP, a generalizable autonomous pentesting framework that aims to realizes efficient policy training in realistic environments and train generalizable agents capable of drawing inferences about other cases from one instance. GAP introduces a Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipeline that (a) enables end-to-end policy learning in unknown real environments while constructing realistic simulations; (b) improves agents' generalization ability by leveraging domain randomization and meta-RL learning.Specially, we are among the first to apply domain randomization in autonomous pentesting and propose a large language model-powered domain randomization method for synthetic environment generation. We further apply meta-RL to improve agents' generalization ability in unseen environments by leveraging synthetic environments. The combination of two methods effectively bridges the generalization gap and improves agents' policy adaptation performance.Experiments are conducted on various vulnerable virtual machines, with results showing that GAP can enable policy learning in various realistic environments, achieve zero-shot policy transfer in similar environments, and realize rapid policy adaptation in dissimilar environments.

### Harnessing Language's Fractal Geometry with Recursive Inference Scaling
**Authors**: Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Xiaohua Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:11:40Z

**Summary**: Recent research in language modeling reveals two scaling effects: the well-known improvement from increased training compute, and a lesser-known boost from applying more sophisticated or computationally intensive inference methods. Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time. For a given fixed model architecture and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. These advantages are maintained even when compared to state-of-the-art recursive techniques like the "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM. Finally, stochastic RINS not only can enhance performance further but also provides the flexibility to optionally forgo increased inference computation at test time with minimal performance degradation.

### Mediator: Memory-efficient LLM Merging with Less Parameter Conflicts and   Uncertainty Based Routing
**Authors**: Kunfeng Lai, Zhenheng Tang, Xinglin Pan, Peijie Dong, Xiang Liu, Haolan Chen, Li Shen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:09:51Z

**Summary**: Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.

**Authors**: Yuanpeng Li, Zhen Xu, Zongwei Lv, Yannan Hu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:54:56Z

**Summary**: Network stream mining is fundamental to many network operations. Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.

### GANQ: GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Pengxiang Zhao, Xiaoming Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:50:15Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial resource requirements. While low-bit quantized weights can reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency, current hardware lacks native support for mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM), resulting in inefficient dequantization-based implementations. Moreover, uniform quantization methods often fail to capture weight distributions adequately, leading to performance degradation. We propose GANQ (GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization), a layer-wise post-training non-uniform quantization framework optimized for hardware-efficient lookup table-based mpGEMM. GANQ achieves superior quantization performance by utilizing a training-free, GPU-adaptive optimization algorithm to efficiently reduce layer-wise quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate GANQ's ability to reduce the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline compared to state-of-the-art methods for both 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, when deployed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, GANQ's quantized models achieve up to 2.57$\times$ speedup over the baseline, advancing memory and inference efficiency in LLM deployment.

### Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn   More
**Authors**: Xialie Zhuang, Zhikai Jia, Jianjin Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Li Shen, Zheng Cao, Shiwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:49:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multilingual Code Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Jian Yang, Wei Zhang, Jiaxi Yang, Yibo Miao, Shanghaoran Quan, Zhenhe Wu, Qiyao Peng, Liqun Yang, Tianyu Liu, Zeyu Cui, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:46:38Z

**Summary**: Recent advancement in code understanding and generation demonstrates that code LLMs fine-tuned on a high-quality instruction dataset can gain powerful capabilities to address wide-ranging code-related tasks. However, most previous existing methods mainly view each programming language in isolation and ignore the knowledge transfer among different programming languages. To bridge the gap among different programming languages, we introduce a novel multi-agent collaboration framework to enhance multilingual instruction tuning for code LLMs, where multiple language-specific intelligent agent components with generation memory work together to transfer knowledge from one language to another efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we first generate the language-specific instruction data from the code snippets and then provide the generated data as the seed data for language-specific agents. Multiple language-specific agents discuss and collaborate to formulate a new instruction and its corresponding solution (A new programming language or existing programming language), To further encourage the cross-lingual transfer, each agent stores its generation history as memory and then summarizes its merits and faults. Finally, the high-quality multilingual instruction data is used to encourage knowledge transfer among different programming languages to train Qwen2.5-xCoder. Experimental results on multilingual programming benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Qwen2.5-xCoder in sharing common knowledge, highlighting its potential to reduce the cross-lingual gap.

### Limits to scalable evaluation at the frontier: LLM as Judge won't beat   twice the data
**Authors**: Florian E. Dorner, Vivian Y. Nastl, Moritz Hardt

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:39:18Z

**Summary**: High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.

### ETimeline: An Extensive Timeline Generation Dataset based on Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Xiaochen Liu, Yanan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:34:33Z

**Summary**: Timeline generation is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the development of events over time. Its goal is to organize news chronologically, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be obscured when viewing news in isolation, making it easier to track the development of stories and understand the interrelationships between key events. Timelines are now common in various commercial products, but academic research in this area is notably scarce. Additionally, the current datasets are in need of refinement for enhanced utility and expanded coverage. In this paper, we propose ETimeline, which encompasses over $13,000$ news articles, spanning $600$ bilingual timelines across $28$ news domains. Specifically, we gather a candidate pool of more than $120,000$ news articles and employ the large language model (LLM) Pipeline to improve performance, ultimately yielding the ETimeline. The data analysis underscores the appeal of ETimeline. Additionally, we also provide the news pool data for further research and analysis. This work contributes to the advancement of timeline generation research and supports a wide range of tasks, including topic generation and event relationships. We believe that this dataset will serve as a catalyst for innovative research and bridge the gap between academia and industry in understanding the practical application of technology services. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/11392212

### Scaling relations for the uncertainty in neutron star radius inferred   from pulse profile modelling: the effect of spin rate
**Authors**: Erik Bootsma, Serena Vinciguerra, Anna L. Watts, Yves Kini, Tuomo Salmi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:26:20Z

**Summary**: Pulse profile modelling using X-ray data from NICER permits the inference of mass and radius for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. This in turn constrains the equation of state of cold dense matter. Previous studies indicate that the uncertainty in the inferred radius should reduce as neutron star spin rate increases. Here we test this using one of the pipelines currently being used for pulse profile modelling with NICER data. We synthesize a set of pulse profiles, assuming different neutron star spin frequencies, spanning the range (25-700) Hz. All of the simulated data sets are generated with the same (single) hot spot configuration, assuming a neutron star mass and radius of $1.6\,M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ and $10$ km. For this restricted set of synthetic data, we find no improvement in the radius credible interval once spin frequency exceeds a certain value (in this specific case $\sim 200$ Hz). If this result were to apply more generally, it would have important implications for the observing strategy for current and future pulse profile modelling missions: targets can be prioritized based on properties other than their spin frequencies, as long as we are in the millisecond range.

### 5D Neural Surrogates for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Simulations of Plasma   Turbulence
**Authors**: Gianluca Galletti, Fabian Paischer, Paul Setinek, William Hornsby, Lorenzo Zanisi, Naomi Carey, Stanislas Pamela, Johannes Brandstetter

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:25:10Z

**Summary**: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge, making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production via nuclear fusion.

### SampleLLM: Optimizing Tabular Data Synthesis in Recommendations
**Authors**: Jingtong Gao, Zhaocheng Du, Xiaopeng Li, Yichao Wang, Xiangyang Li, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang, Xiangyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:19:40Z

**Summary**: Tabular data synthesis is crucial in machine learning, yet existing general methods-primarily based on statistical or deep learning models-are highly data-dependent and often fall short in recommender systems. This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding. However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset. To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited. The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM. Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios.

### Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Heyang Zhao, Chenlu Ye, Wei Xiong, Quanquan Gu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:11:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.

**Authors**: Erfan Moosavi Monazzah, Vahid Rahimzadeh, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh, Azadeh Shakery, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:07:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models predominantly reflect Western cultures, largely due to the dominance of English-centric training data. This imbalance presents a significant challenge, as LLMs are increasingly used across diverse contexts without adequate evaluation of their cultural competence in non-English languages, including Persian. To address this gap, we introduce PerCul, a carefully constructed dataset designed to assess the sensitivity of LLMs toward Persian culture. PerCul features story-based, multiple-choice questions that capture culturally nuanced scenarios. Unlike existing benchmarks, PerCul is curated with input from native Persian annotators to ensure authenticity and to prevent the use of translation as a shortcut. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual and Persian-specific LLMs, establishing a foundation for future research in cross-cultural NLP evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate a 11.3% gap between best closed source model and layperson baseline while the gap increases to 21.3% by using the best open-weight model.

### Transformer Neural Processes - Kernel Regression
**Authors**: Daniel Jenson, Jhonathan Navott, Mengyan Zhang, Makkunda Sharma, Elizaveta Semenova, Seth Flaxman

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:03:24Z

**Summary**: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes. Originally developed as a scalable alternative to Gaussian Processes (GPs), which are limited by $O(n^3)$ runtime complexity, the most accurate modern NPs can often rival GPs but still suffer from an $O(n^2)$ bottleneck due to their attention mechanism. We introduce the Transformer Neural Process - Kernel Regression (TNP-KR), a scalable NP featuring: (1) a Kernel Regression Block (KRBlock), a simple, extensible, and parameter efficient transformer block with complexity $O(n_c^2 + n_c n_t)$, where $n_c$ and $n_t$ are the number of context and test points, respectively; (2) a kernel-based attention bias; and (3) two novel attention mechanisms: scan attention (SA), a memory-efficient scan-based attention that when paired with a kernel-based bias can make TNP-KR translation invariant, and deep kernel attention (DKA), a Performer-style attention that implicitly incoporates a distance bias and further reduces complexity to $O(n_c)$. These enhancements enable both TNP-KR variants to perform inference with 100K context points on over 1M test points in under a minute on a single 24GB GPU. On benchmarks spanning meta regression, Bayesian optimization, image completion, and epidemiology, TNP-KR with DKA outperforms its Performer counterpart on nearly every benchmark, while TNP-KR with SA achieves state-of-the-art results.

### Improving Autoformalization using Type Checking
**Authors**: Auguste Poiroux, Gail Weiss, Viktor Kunčak, Antoine Bosselut

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:02:10Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization, the automatic translation of unconstrained natural language into formal languages, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in theorem proving, formal verification, and LLM output checking. In this work, we analyze both current autoformalization methods and the processes used to evaluate them, focusing specifically on the Lean 4 theorem proving language. We demonstrate that scaling type-check filtering with self-consistency techniques on top of existing methods significantly improves performance, achieving absolute accuracy gains of up to +18.4\% on ProofNet. To support reproducibility and further research, we release our code, including new symbolic equivalence for Lean formulas. We also release new benchmarks: a new research-level mathematics dataset RLM25, a corrected ProofNet, and ProofNetVerif with labeled correct and incorrect autoformalization pairs for evaluating metrics.

### Towards bandit-based prompt-tuning for in-the-wild foundation agents
**Authors**: Finn Rietz, Oleg Smirnov, Sara Karimi, Lele Cao

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:54:40Z

**Summary**: Prompting has emerged as the dominant paradigm for adapting large, pre-trained transformer-based models to downstream tasks. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline reinforcement learning pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: Not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. To address this, we propose an inference time bandit-based prompt-tuning framework that explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines.

### Vulnerability-Triggering Test Case Generation from Third-Party Libraries
**Authors**: Yi Gao, Xing Hu, Zirui Chen, Xiaohu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:53:20Z

**Summary**: Open-source third-party libraries are widely used in software development. These libraries offer substantial advantages in terms of time and resource savings. However, a significant concern arises due to the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within these libraries. Existing automated vulnerability detection tools often suffer from false positives and fail to accurately assess the propagation of inputs capable of triggering vulnerabilities from client projects to vulnerable code in libraries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called VULEUT (Vulnerability Exploit Unit Test Generation), which combines vulnerability exploitation reachability analysis and LLM-based unit test generation. VULEUT is designed to automatically verify the exploitability of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries commonly used in client software projects. VULEUT first analyzes the client projects to determine the reachability of vulnerability conditions. And then, it leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate unit tests for vulnerability confirmation. To evaluate the effectiveness of VULEUT, we collect 32 vulnerabilities from various third-party libraries and conduct experiments on 70 real client projects. Besides, we also compare our approach with two representative tools, i.e., TRANSFER and VESTA. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of VULEUT, with 229 out of 292 generated unit tests successfully confirming vulnerability exploitation across 70 client projects, which outperforms baselines by 24%.

### Automated Unit Test Refactoring
**Authors**: Yi Gao, Xing Hu, Xiaohu Yang, Xin Xia

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:52:54Z

**Summary**: Test smells arise from poor design practices and insufficient domain knowledge, which can lower the quality of test code and make it harder to maintain and update. Manually refactoring test smells is time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the necessity for automated approaches. Current rule-based refactoring methods often struggle in scenarios not covered by predefined rules and lack the flexibility needed to handle diverse cases effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called UTRefactor, a context-enhanced, LLM-based framework for automatic test refactoring in Java projects. UTRefactor extracts relevant context from test code and leverages an external knowledge base that includes test smell definitions, descriptions, and DSL-based refactoring rules. By simulating the manual refactoring process through a chain-of-thought approach, UTRefactor guides the LLM to eliminate test smells in a step-by-step process, ensuring both accuracy and consistency throughout the refactoring. Additionally, we implement a checkpoint mechanism to facilitate comprehensive refactoring, particularly when multiple smells are present. We evaluate UTRefactor on 879 tests from six open-source Java projects, reducing the number of test smells from 2,375 to 265, achieving an 89% reduction. UTRefactor outperforms direct LLM-based refactoring methods by 61.82% in smell elimination and significantly surpasses the performance of a rule-based test smell refactoring tool. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of UTRefactor in enhancing test code quality while minimizing manual involvement.

### Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon
**Authors**: Nurit Cohen-Inger, Yehonatan Elisha, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach, Seffi Cohen

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:43:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.

### Approximating Human Strategic Reasoning with LLM-Enhanced Recursive   Reasoners Leveraging Multi-agent Hypergames
**Authors**: Vince Trencsenyi, Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:37:20Z

**Summary**: LLM-driven multi-agent-based simulations have been gaining traction with applications in game-theoretic and social simulations. While most implementations seek to exploit or evaluate LLM-agentic reasoning, they often do so with a weak notion of agency and simplified architectures. We implement a role-based multi-agent strategic interaction framework tailored to sophisticated recursive reasoners, providing the means for systematic in-depth development and evaluation of strategic reasoning. Our game environment is governed by the umpire responsible for facilitating games, from matchmaking through move validation to environment management. Players incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs in their decision mechanism, relying on a formal hypergame-based model of hierarchical beliefs. We use one-shot, 2-player beauty contests to evaluate the recursive reasoning capabilities of the latest LLMs, providing a comparison to an established baseline model from economics and data from human experiments. Furthermore, we introduce the foundations of an alternative semantic measure of reasoning to the k-level theory. Our experiments show that artificial reasoners can outperform the baseline model in terms of both approximating human behaviour and reaching the optimal solution.

 ### DarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Oliver Sieberling, Eldar Kurtic, Zhiqiang Shen, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:59:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various NLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for \emph{non-uniform} model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose \sysname, a method for \emph{training-aware} structured pruning. \sysname builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, \sysname surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring $5\times$ less training data during post-compression training.

### OLMES: A Standard for Language Model Evaluations
**Authors**: Yuling Gu, Oyvind Tafjord, Bailey Kuehl, Dany Haddad, Jesse Dodge, Hannaneh Hajishirzi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:59:26Z

**Summary**: Progress in AI is often demonstrated by new models claiming improved performance on tasks measuring model capabilities. Evaluating language models can be particularly challenging, as choices of how a model is evaluated on a task can lead to large changes in measured performance. There is no common standard setup, so different models are evaluated on the same tasks in different ways, leading to claims about which models perform best not being reproducible. We propose OLMES, a completely documented, practical, open standard for reproducible LLM evaluations. In developing this standard, we identify and review the varying factors in evaluation practices adopted by the community - such as details of prompt formatting, choice of in-context examples, probability normalizations, and task formulation. In particular, OLMES supports meaningful comparisons between smaller base models that require the unnatural "cloze" formulation of multiple-choice questions against larger models that can utilize the original formulation. OLMES includes well-considered, documented recommendations guided by results from existing literature as well as new experiments resolving open questions.

### Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs
**Authors**: Chenchen Gu, Xiang Lisa Li, Rohith Kuditipudi, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:58:04Z

**Summary**: Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

### Automatic Robot Task Planning by Integrating Large Language Model with   Genetic Programming
**Authors**: Azizjon Kobilov, Jianglin Lan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:56:20Z

**Summary**: Accurate task planning is critical for controlling autonomous systems, such as robots, drones, and self-driving vehicles. Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.

### Breaking Down Bias: On The Limits of Generalizable Pruning Strategies
**Authors**: Sibo Ma, Alejandro Salinas, Peter Henderson, Julian Nyarko

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:55:57Z

**Summary**: We employ model pruning to examine how LLMs conceptualize racial biases, and whether a generalizable mitigation strategy for such biases appears feasible. Our analysis yields several novel insights. We find that pruning can be an effective method to reduce bias without significantly increasing anomalous model behavior. Neuron-based pruning strategies generally yield better results than approaches pruning entire attention heads. However, our results also show that the effectiveness of either approach quickly deteriorates as pruning strategies become more generalized. For instance, a model that is trained on removing racial biases in the context of financial decision-making poorly generalizes to biases in commercial transactions. Overall, our analysis suggests that racial biases are only partially represented as a general concept within language models. The other part of these biases is highly context-specific, suggesting that generalizable mitigation strategies may be of limited effectiveness. Our findings have important implications for legal frameworks surrounding AI. In particular, they suggest that an effective mitigation strategy should include the allocation of legal responsibility on those that deploy models in a specific use case.

### Effect of Adaptive Communication Support on LLM-powered Human-Robot   Collaboration
**Authors**: Shipeng Liu, FNU Shrutika, Boshen Zhang, Zhehui Huang, Gaurav Sukhatme, Feifei Qian

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:52:51Z

**Summary**: Effective human-robot collaboration requires robot to adopt their roles and levels of support based on human needs, task requirements, and complexity. Traditional human-robot teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance, and a Manager for subtask-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited a stronger preference towards robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive robotic agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to a large number of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communications to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.

### Great Power Brings Great Responsibility: Personalizing Conversational AI   for Diverse Problem-Solvers
**Authors**: Italo Santos, Katia Romero Felizardo, Igor Steinmacher, Marco A. Gerosa

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:46:01Z

**Summary**: Newcomers onboarding to Open Source Software (OSS) projects face many challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have emerged as potential resources for answering questions and providing guidance, with many developers now turning to ChatGPT over traditional Q&A sites like Stack Overflow. Nonetheless, LLMs may carry biases in presenting information, which can be especially impactful for newcomers whose problem-solving styles may not be broadly represented. This raises important questions about the accessibility of AI-driven support for newcomers to OSS projects. This vision paper outlines the potential of adapting AI responses to various problem-solving styles to avoid privileging a particular subgroup. We discuss the potential of AI persona-based prompt engineering as a strategy for interacting with AI. This study invites further research to refine AI-based tools to better support contributions to OSS projects.

### Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:45:12Z

**Summary**: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

### Language Model Council: Democratically Benchmarking Foundation Models on   Highly Subjective Tasks
**Authors**: Justin Zhao, Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Benjie Genchel, Amanda Cercas Curry

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:42:44Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, evaluating them remains a persistent challenge. Many recent evaluations use LLMs as judges to score outputs from other LLMs, often relying on a single large model like GPT-4o. However, using a single LLM judge is prone to intra-model bias, and many tasks - such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, and persuasiveness - may be too subjective for a single model to judge fairly. We introduce the Language Model Council (LMC), where a group of LLMs collaborate to create tests, respond to them, and evaluate each other's responses to produce a ranking in a democratic fashion. Unlike previous approaches that focus on reducing cost or bias by using a panel of smaller models, our work examines the benefits and nuances of a fully inclusive LLM evaluation system. In a detailed case study on emotional intelligence, we deploy a council of 20 recent LLMs to rank each other on open-ended responses to interpersonal conflicts. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable and more robust, and through a user study, we show that they are more consistent with human evaluations than any individual LLM judge. Using all LLMs for judging can be costly, however, so we use Monte Carlo simulations and hand-curated sub-councils to study hypothetical council compositions and discuss the value of the incremental LLM judge.

### Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher   Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension
**Authors**: Wenbo Gong, Meyer Scetbon, Chao Ma, Edward Meeds

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:27:19Z

**Summary**: Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Active Queries
**Authors**: Kaixuan Ji, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:18:59Z

**Summary**: Aligning large language models (LLM) with human preference plays a key role in building modern generative models and can be achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ instance-dependent regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method.

### Faux Polyglot: A Study on Information Disparity in Multilingual Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Nikhil Sharma, Kenton Murray, Ziang Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:17:53Z

**Summary**: Although the multilingual capability of LLMs offers new opportunities to overcome the language barrier, do these capabilities translate into real-life scenarios where linguistic divide and knowledge conflicts between multilingual sources are known occurrences? In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a cross-language RAG-based information search setting. We found that LLMs displayed systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both document retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where no information is in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages during generation, potentially reinforcing the dominant views. Such bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries. Our results highlight the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems. The seemingly beneficial multilingual capability of LLMs may backfire on information parity by reinforcing language-specific information cocoons or filter bubbles further marginalizing low-resource views.

### WHODUNIT: Evaluation benchmark for culprit detection in mystery stories
**Authors**: Kshitij Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:14:44Z

**Summary**: We present a novel data set, WhoDunIt, to assess the deductive reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM) within narrative contexts. Constructed from open domain mystery novels and short stories, the dataset challenges LLMs to identify the perpetrator after reading and comprehending the story. To evaluate model robustness, we apply a range of character-level name augmentations, including original names, name swaps, and substitutions with well-known real and/or fictional entities from popular discourse. We further use various prompting styles to investigate the influence of prompting on deductive reasoning accuracy.   We conduct evaluation study with state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o-mini, evaluated through multiple trials with majority response selection to ensure reliability. The results demonstrate that while LLMs perform reliably on unaltered texts, accuracy diminishes with certain name substitutions, particularly those with wide recognition. This dataset is publicly available here.

### Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently
**Authors**: Daman Arora, Andrea Zanette

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T18:06:02Z

**Summary**: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models.   In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.

### The Economics of Large Language Models: Token Allocation, Fine-Tuning,   and Optimal Pricing
**Authors**: Dirk Bergemann, Alessandro Bonatti, Alex Smolin

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:55:15Z

**Summary**: We develop an economic framework to analyze the optimal pricing and product design of Large Language Models (LLM). Our framework captures several key features of LLMs: variable operational costs of processing input and output tokens; the ability to customize models through fine-tuning; and high-dimensional user heterogeneity in terms of task requirements and error sensitivity. In our model, a monopolistic seller offers multiple versions of LLMs through a menu of products. The optimal pricing structure depends on whether token allocation across tasks is contractible and whether users face scale constraints. Users with similar aggregate value-scale characteristics choose similar levels of fine-tuning and token consumption. The optimal mechanism can be implemented through menus of two-part tariffs, with higher markups for more intensive users. Our results rationalize observed industry practices such as tiered pricing based on model customization and usage levels.

### Verifying LLM-Generated Code in the Context of Software Verification   with Ada/SPARK
**Authors**: Marcos Cramer, Lucian McIntyre

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:42:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable code generation capabilities, but the correctness of the generated code cannot be inherently trusted. This paper explores the feasibility of using formal software verification, specifically the SPARK framework for Ada, to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated code. We present Marmaragan, a tool that leverages an LLM in order to generate SPARK annotations for existing programs, enabling formal verification of the code. The tool is benchmarked on a curated set of SPARK programs, with annotations selectively removed to test specific capabilities. The performance of Marmaragan with GPT-4o on the benchmark is promising, with correct annotations having been generated for 50.7% of the benchmark cases. The results establish a foundation for future work on combining the power of LLMs with the reliability of formal software verification.

### Hallucination Detection in Foundation Models for Decision-Making: A   Flexible Definition and Review of the State of the Art
**Authors**: Neeloy Chakraborty, Melkior Ornik, Katherine Driggs-Campbell

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:40:41Z

**Summary**: Autonomous systems are soon to be ubiquitous, spanning manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, entertainment, and other industries. Most of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these approaches perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets has led researchers to believe that these models may provide "common sense" reasoning that existing planners are missing, bridging the gap between algorithm development and deployment. While researchers have shown promising results in deploying foundation models to decision-making tasks, these models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, present guidelines, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.

### Glinthawk: A Two-Tiered Architecture for Offline LLM Inference
**Authors**: Pouya Hamadanian, Sadjad Fouladi

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:36:32Z

**Summary**: We introduce Glinthawk, an architecture for offline Large Language Model (LLM) inference. By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the utilization of the high-end accelerators ("Tier 1") by offloading the attention mechanism to lower-end compute tier ("Tier 2"). This separation allows the memory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale independently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU VMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch processing. The prototype is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk.

### TMLC-Net: Transferable Meta Label Correction for Noisy Label Learning
**Authors**: Mengyang Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:33:48Z

**Summary**: The prevalence of noisy labels in real-world datasets poses a significant impediment to the effective deployment of deep learning models. While meta-learning strategies have emerged as a promising approach for addressing this challenge, existing methods often suffer from limited transferability and task-specific designs. This paper introduces TMLC-Net, a novel Transferable Meta-Learner for Correcting Noisy Labels, designed to overcome these limitations. TMLC-Net learns a general-purpose label correction strategy that can be readily applied across diverse datasets and model architectures without requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Our approach integrates three core components: (1) Normalized Noise Perception, which captures and normalizes training dynamics to handle distribution shifts; (2) Time-Series Encoding, which models the temporal evolution of sample statistics using a recurrent neural network; and (3) Subclass Decoding, which predicts a corrected label distribution based on the learned representations. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with various noise types and levels, demonstrating that TMLC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness to label noise. Furthermore, we analyze the transferability of TMLC-Net, showcasing its adaptability to new datasets and noise conditions, and establishing its potential as a broadly applicable solution for robust deep learning in noisy environments.

### Donald Trumps in the Virtual Polls: Simulating and Predicting Public   Opinions in Surveys Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shapeng Jiang, Lijia Wei, Chen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:20:00Z

**Summary**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have attracted attention due to their ability to generate human-like text. As surveys and opinion polls remain key tools for gauging public attitudes, there is increasing interest in assessing whether LLMs can accurately replicate human responses. This study examines the potential of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT-4o, to replicate human responses in large-scale surveys and to predict election outcomes based on demographic data. Employing data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the American National Election Studies (ANES), we assess the LLM's performance in two key tasks: simulating human responses and forecasting U.S. election results. In simulations, the LLM was tasked with generating synthetic responses for various socio-cultural and trust-related questions, demonstrating notable alignment with human response patterns across U.S.-China samples, though with some limitations on value-sensitive topics. In prediction tasks, the LLM was used to simulate voting behavior in past U.S. elections and predict the 2024 election outcome. Our findings show that the LLM replicates cultural differences effectively, exhibits in-sample predictive validity, and provides plausible out-of-sample forecasts, suggesting potential as a cost-effective supplement for survey-based research.

### MAGELLAN: Metacognitive predictions of learning progress guide autotelic   LLM agents in large goal spaces
**Authors**: Loris Gaven, Thomas Carta, Clément Romac, Cédric Colas, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T17:08:00Z

**Summary**: Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP). When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.

### FinTruthQA: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Quality of Financial   Information Disclosure
**Authors**: Ziyue Xu, Peilin Zhou, Xinyu Shi, Jiageng Wu, Yikang Jiang, Dading Chong, Bin Ke, Jie Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:49:17Z

**Summary**: Accurate and transparent financial information disclosure is essential in accounting and finance, fostering trust and enabling informed investment decisions that drive economic development. Among many information disclosure platforms, the Chinese stock exchanges' investor interactive platform provides a novel and interactive way for listed firms to disclose information of interest to investors through an online question-and-answer (Q&A) format. However, it is common for listed firms to respond to questions with limited or no substantive information, and automatically evaluating the quality of financial information disclosure on large amounts of Q&A pairs is challenging. In this study, our interdisciplinary team of AI and finance professionals proposed FinTruthQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the automatic quality assessment of information disclosure in financial Q&A data. It comprises 6,000 real-world financial Q&A entries and each Q&A was manually annotated based on four key evaluation criteria. We benchmarked various NLP techniques on FinTruthQA, including large language models(LLMs). Experiments showed that existing NLP models have strong predictive ability for question identification and question relevance tasks, but are suboptimal for answer readability and answer relevance tasks. By establishing this benchmark, we provide a robust foundation for the automatic evaluation of information disclosure, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged for social good by promoting transparency, fairness, and investor protection in financial disclosure practices. FinTruthQA can be used by auditors, regulators, and financial analysts for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making, as well as by researchers for advanced studies in accounting and finance, ultimately fostering greater trust and efficiency in the financial markets.

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:48:15Z

**Summary**: Llama-Breeze2 (hereinafter referred to as Breeze2) is a suite of advanced multi-modal language models, available in 3B and 8B parameter configurations, specifically designed to enhance Traditional Chinese language representation. Building upon the Llama 3.2 model family, we continue the pre-training of Breeze2 on an extensive corpus to enhance the linguistic and cultural heritage of Traditional Chinese. In addition to language modeling capabilities, we significantly augment the models with function calling and vision understanding capabilities. At the time of this publication, as far as we are aware, absent reasoning-inducing prompts, Breeze2 are the strongest performing models in Traditional Chinese function calling and image understanding in its size class. The effectiveness of Breeze2 is benchmarked across various tasks, including Taiwan general knowledge, instruction-following, long context, function calling, and vision understanding. We are publicly releasing all Breeze2 models under the Llama 3.2 Community License. We also showcase the capabilities of the model running on mobile platform with a mobile application which we also open source.

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:38:16Z

**Summary**: We consider the possible role of current large language models (LLMs) in the study of human linguistic cognition. We focus on the use of such models as proxies for theories of cognition that are relatively linguistically-neutral in their representations and learning but differ from current LLMs in key ways. We illustrate this potential use of LLMs as proxies for theories of cognition in the context of two kinds of questions: (a) whether the target theory accounts for the acquisition of a given pattern from a given corpus; and (b) whether the target theory makes a given typologically-attested pattern easier to acquire than another, typologically-unattested pattern. For each of the two questions we show, building on recent literature, how current LLMs can potentially be of help, but we note that at present this help is quite limited.

### Evaluating Evidence Attribution in Generated Fact Checking Explanations
**Authors**: Rui Xing, Timothy Baldwin, Jey Han Lau

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:36:32Z

**Summary**: Automated fact-checking systems often struggle with trustworthiness, as their generated explanations can include hallucinations. In this work, we explore evidence attribution for fact-checking explanation generation. We introduce a novel evaluation protocol -- citation masking and recovery -- to assess attribution quality in generated explanations. We implement our protocol using both human annotators and automatic annotators, and find that LLM annotation correlates with human annotation, suggesting that attribution assessment can be automated. Finally, our experiments reveal that: (1) the best-performing LLMs still generate explanations with inaccurate attributions; and (2) human-curated evidence is essential for generating better explanations. Code and data are available here: https://github.com/ruixing76/Transparent-FCExp.

**Authors**: Jin Wu, Haoying Zhou, Peter Kazanzides, Adnan Munawar, Anqi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:27:42Z

**Summary**: Despite advancements in robotic-assisted surgery, automating complex tasks like suturing remain challenging due to the need for adaptability and precision. Learning-based approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), require realistic simulation environments for efficient data collection. However, current platforms often include only relatively simple, non-dexterous manipulations and lack the flexibility required for effective learning and generalization.   We introduce SurgicAI, a novel platform for development and benchmarking addressing these challenges by providing the flexibility to accommodate both modular subtasks and more importantly task decomposition in RL-based surgical robotics. Compatible with the da Vinci Surgical System, SurgicAI offers a standardized pipeline for collecting and utilizing expert demonstrations. It supports deployment of multiple RL and IL approaches, and the training of both singular and compositional subtasks in suturing scenarios, featuring high dexterity and modularization. Meanwhile, SurgicAI sets clear metrics and benchmarks for the assessment of learned policies. We implemented and evaluated multiple RL and IL algorithms on SurgicAI. Our detailed benchmark analysis underscores SurgicAI's potential to advance policy learning in surgical robotics. Details: https://github.com/surgical-robotics-ai/SurgicAI

### Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering
**Authors**: Bruce W. Lee, Inkit Padhi, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Erik Miehling, Pierre Dognin, Manish Nagireddy, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:22:45Z

**Summary**: LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities, but precisely controlling their response behavior remains challenging. Existing activation steering methods alter LLM behavior indiscriminately, limiting their practical applicability in settings where selective responses are essential, such as content moderation or domain-specific assistants. In this paper, we propose Conditional Activation Steering (CAST), which analyzes LLM activation patterns during inference to selectively apply or withhold activation steering based on the input context. Our method is based on the observation that different categories of prompts activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states. Using CAST, one can systematically control LLM behavior with rules like "if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse" or "if input is not about legal advice, then refuse." This allows for selective modification of responses to specific content while maintaining normal responses to other content, all without requiring weight optimization. We release an open-source implementation of our framework at <github.com/IBM/activation-steering>.

### Quantifying the benefits of code hints for refactoring deprecated Java   APIs
**Authors**: Cristina David, Pascal Kesseli, Daniel Kroening, Hanliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:22:24Z

**Summary**: When done manually, refactoring legacy code in order to eliminate uses of deprecated APIs is an error-prone and time-consuming process. In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.

### Language Models Largely Exhibit Human-like Constituent Ordering   Preferences
**Authors**: Ada Defne Tur, Gaurav Kamath, Siva Reddy

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T16:02:57Z

**Summary**: Though English sentences are typically inflexible vis-\`a-vis word order, constituents often show far more variability in ordering. One prominent theory presents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with constituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such theories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP), because while recent advances in NLP have led to significant gains in the performance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how these models process language, and how this compares to human language processing. In particular, the question remains whether LLMs display the same patterns with constituent movement, and may provide insights into existing theories on when and how the shift occurs in human language. We compare a variety of LLMs with diverse properties to evaluate broad LLM performance on four types of constituent movement: heavy NP shift, particle movement, dative alternation, and multiple PPs. Despite performing unexpectedly around particle movement, LLMs generally align with human preferences around constituent ordering.

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users in executing various tasks and providing guidance on decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized controlled trial with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) employing explicit psychological tactics to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' decision patterns and shifts in their preference ratings post-interaction, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly, across both decision-making domains, participants interacting with the manipulative agents shifted toward harmful options at substantially higher rates (financial, MA: 62.3%, SEMA: 59.6%; emotional, MA: 42.3%, SEMA: 41.5%) compared to the NA group (financial, 35.8%; emotional, 12.8%). Notably, our findings reveal that even subtle manipulative objectives (MA) can be as effective as employing explicit psychological strategies (SEMA) in swaying human decision-making. By revealing the potential for covert AI influence, this study highlights a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies and protect human autonomy.

### ProjectTest: A Project-level LLM Unit Test Generation Benchmark and   Impact of Error Fixing Mechanisms
**Authors**: Yibo Wang, Congying Xia, Wenting Zhao, Jiangshu Du, Chunyu Miao, Zhongfen Deng, Philip S. Yu, Chen Xing

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:48:42Z

**Summary**: Unit test generation has become a promising and important use case of LLMs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for assessing LLM unit test generation capabilities focus on function- or class-level code rather than more practical and challenging project-level codebases. To address such limitation, we propose ProjectTest, a project-level benchmark for unit test generation covering Python, Java, and JavaScript. ProjectTest features 20 moderate-sized and high-quality projects per language. We evaluate nine frontier LLMs on ProjectTest and the results show that all frontier LLMs tested exhibit moderate performance on ProjectTest on Python and Java, highlighting the difficulty of ProjectTest. We also conduct a thorough error analysis, which shows that even frontier LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, have significant simple errors, including compilation and cascade errors. Motivated by this observation, we further evaluate all frontier LLMs under manual error-fixing and self-error-fixing scenarios to assess their potential when equipped with error-fixing mechanisms.

**Authors**: Mengxi Xiao, Zihao Jiang, Lingfei Qian, Zhengyu Chen, Yueru He, Yijing Xu, Yuecheng Jiang, Dong Li, Ruey-Ling Weng, Min Peng, Jimin Huang, Sophia Ananiadou, Qianqian Xie

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:45:52Z

**Summary**: Stock movement prediction, a critical task in financial time-series forecasting, relies on identifying and retrieving key influencing factors from vast and complex datasets. However, traditional text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of financial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B large language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, a novel candidate selection method enhanced by LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes the similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These advancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support robust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial indicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval methods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an 8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful sequences compared to existing retrieval methods. This work highlights the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel, scalable framework for future research in the field.

### Model Surgery: Modulating LLM's Behavior Via Simple Parameter Editing
**Authors**: Huanqian Wang, Yang Yue, Rui Lu, Jingxin Shi, Andrew Zhao, Shenzhi Wang, Shiji Song, Gao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:39:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential as generalist assistants, showcasing powerful task understanding and problem-solving capabilities. To deploy LLMs as AI assistants, it is crucial that these models exhibit desirable behavioral traits, such as non-toxicity and resilience against jailbreak attempts. Current approaches for detoxification or preventing jailbreaking usually involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which requires finetuning billions of parameters through gradient descent with substantial computational cost. Furthermore, models modified through SFT and RLHF may deviate from the pretrained models, potentially leading to a degradation in foundational LLM capabilities. In this paper, we observe that surprisingly, directly editing a small subset of parameters can effectively modulate specific behaviors of LLMs, such as detoxification and resistance to jailbreaking, with only inference-level computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that in the detoxification task, our approach achieves reductions of up to 90.0% in toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and 49.2% on ToxiGen, while maintaining the LLM's general capabilities in areas such as common sense, question answering, and mathematics

### SymGPT: Auditing Smart Contracts via Combining Symbolic Execution with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shihao Xia, Mengting He, Shuai Shao, Tingting Yu, Yiying Zhang, Linhai Song

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:34:00Z

**Summary**: To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.

**Authors**: Annika Simonsen, Dan Saattrup Nielsen, Hafsteinn Einarsson

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:33:17Z

**Summary**: We present FoQA, a Faroese extractive question-answering (QA) dataset with 2,000 samples, created using a semi-automated approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and human validation. The dataset was generated from Faroese Wikipedia articles using GPT-4-turbo for initial QA generation, followed by question rephrasing to increase complexity and native speaker validation to ensure quality. We provide baseline performance metrics for FoQA across multiple models, including LLMs and BERT, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating Faroese QA performance. The dataset is released in three versions: a validated set of 2,000 samples, a complete set of all 10,001 generated samples, and a set of 2,395 rejected samples for error analysis.

### Goedel-Prover: A Frontier Model for Open-Source Automated Theorem   Proving
**Authors**: Yong Lin, Shange Tang, Bohan Lyu, Jiayun Wu, Hongzhou Lin, Kaiyu Yang, Jia Li, Mengzhou Xia, Danqi Chen, Sanjeev Arora, Chi Jin

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:27:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating a dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. The final prover outperforms all existing open-source models in whole-proof generation. On the miniF2F benchmark, it achieves a 57.6% success rate (Pass@32), exceeding the previous best open-source model by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works.

### Global weight optimization of frame structures under free-vibration   eigenvalue constraints
**Authors**: Marek Tyburec, Michal Kočvara, Marouan Handa, Jan Zeman

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:18:31Z

**Summary**: Topology optimization of frame structures under free-vibration eigenvalue constraints constitutes a challenging nonconvex polynomial optimization problem with disconnected feasible sets. In this article, we first formulate it as a polynomial semidefinite programming problem (SDP) of minimizing a linear function over a basic semi-algebraic feasible set. We then propose to solve this problem by Lasserre hierarchy of linear semidefinite relaxations providing a sequence of increasing lower bounds. To obtain also a sequence of upper bounds and thus conditions on global $\varepsilon$-optimality, we propose a novel technique. Namely, we provide a bilevel reformulation that exhibits a special structure: The lower level is quasiconvex univariate and its solution satisfies the constraints of the upper-level problem. After deriving the conditions for the solvability of the lower-level problem, we thus provide a way to construct feasible points to the original SDP. Using such a feasible point, we modify the original nonlinear SDP to satisfy the conditions for the deployment of the Lasserre hierarchy. Solving arbitrary degree relaxation of the hierarchy, we prove that scaled first-order moments associated with the problem variables satisfy feasibility conditions for the lower-level problem and thus provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds on the objective function. Using these bounds, we develop a simple sufficient condition for global $\varepsilon$-optimality and prove that the optimality gap $\varepsilon$ converges to zero if the set of global minimizers is convex. Finally, we illustrate these results with three representative problems for which the hierarchy converges in at most four relaxation degrees.

### Exploring Mobile Touch Interaction with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tim Zindulka, Jannek Sekowski, Florian Lehmann, Daniel Buschek

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T15:17:00Z

**Summary**: Interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) for text editing on mobile devices currently requires users to break out of their writing environment and switch to a conversational AI interface. In this paper, we propose to control the LLM via touch gestures performed directly on the text. We first chart a design space that covers fundamental touch input and text transformations. In this space, we then concretely explore two control mappings: spread-to-generate and pinch-to-shorten, with visual feedback loops. We evaluate this concept in a user study (N=14) that compares three feedback designs: no visualisation, text length indicator, and length + word indicator. The results demonstrate that touch-based control of LLMs is both feasible and user-friendly, with the length + word indicator proving most effective for managing text generation. This work lays the foundation for further research into gesture-based interaction with LLMs on touch devices.

### Beyond Prompting: Time2Lang -- Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models   and Large Language Models for Health Sensing
**Authors**: Arvind Pillai, Dimitris Spathis, Subigya Nepal, Amanda C Collins, Daniel M Mackin, Michael V Heinz, Tess Z Griffin, Nicholas C Jacobson, Andrew Campbell

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:58:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:51:08Z

**Summary**: The large and ever-increasing amount of data available on the Internet coupled with the laborious task of manual claim and fact verification has sparked the interest in the development of automated claim verification systems. Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed for this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we present a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline used in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning. Finally, we describe publicly available English datasets created for this task.

### Towards spatial computing: recent advances in multimodal natural   interaction for XR headsets
**Authors**: Zhimin Wang, Maohang Rao, Shanghua Ye, Weitao Song, Feng Lu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:47:32Z

**Summary**: With the widespread adoption of Extended Reality (XR) headsets, spatial computing technologies are gaining increasing attention. Spatial computing enables interaction with virtual elements through natural input methods such as eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands, thus placing natural human-computer interaction at its core. While previous surveys have reviewed conventional XR interaction techniques, recent advancements in natural interaction, particularly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), have introduced new paradigms and technologies. In this paper, we review research on multimodal natural interaction for wearable XR, focusing on papers published between 2022 and 2024 in six top venues: ACM CHI, UIST, IMWUT (Ubicomp), IEEE VR, ISMAR, and TVCG. We classify and analyze these studies based on application scenarios, operation types, and interaction modalities. This analysis provides a structured framework for understanding how researchers are designing advanced natural interaction techniques in XR. Based on these findings, we discuss the challenges in natural interaction techniques and suggest potential directions for future research. This review provides valuable insights for researchers aiming to design natural and efficient interaction systems for XR, ultimately contributing to the advancement of spatial computing.

### We Can't Understand AI Using our Existing Vocabulary
**Authors**: John Hewitt, Robert Geirhos, Been Kim

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:34:05Z

**Summary**: This position paper argues that, in order to understand AI, we cannot rely on our existing vocabulary of human words. Instead, we should strive to develop neologisms: new words that represent precise human concepts that we want to teach machines, or machine concepts that we need to learn. We start from the premise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means interpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able to reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to machines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing neologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful neologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're reusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise information. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a "length neologism" enables controlling LLM response length, while a "diversity neologism" allows sampling more variable responses. Taken together, we argue that we cannot understand AI using our existing vocabulary, and expanding it through neologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding machines better.

### CoCoA: A Generalized Approach to Uncertainty Quantification by   Integrating Confidence and Consistency of LLM Outputs
**Authors**: Roman Vashurin, Maiya Goloburda, Preslav Nakov, Artem Shelmanov, Maxim Panov

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:32:15Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompasses a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches and shown impressive performance in various applications. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that leads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.

### Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for   Recommendation
**Authors**: Yu Wang, Lei Sang, Yi Zhang, Yiwen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:29:44Z

**Summary**: Intent-based recommender systems have garnered significant attention for uncovering latent fine-grained preferences. Intents, as underlying factors of interactions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most methods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user reviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of interaction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the inherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How to align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to extract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations. Specifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal intent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to eliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input features. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we employ momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused intent representations. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that our IRLLRec framework outperforms baselines.

### PIM Is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for Large Language   Model Inference
**Authors**: Yufeng Gu, Alireza Khadem, Sumanth Umesh, Ning Liang, Xavier Servot, Onur Mutlu, Ravi Iyer, Reetuparna Das

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:25:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.

### ChameleonLLM: Batch-Aware Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Inference-Time   Clusters
**Authors**: Kamer Ali Yuksel, Hassan Sawaf

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T14:01:39Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChameleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChameleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference. ChameleonLLM is open-sourced to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChamaleonLLM/

### Fault Localization via Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Mutation   Generated Stack Traces
**Authors**: Neetha Jambigi, Bartosz Bogacz, Moritz Mueller, Thomas Bach, Michael Felderer

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:58:39Z

**Summary**: Abrupt and unexpected terminations of software are termed as software crashes. They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.

### JBShield: Defending Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks through   Activated Concept Analysis and Manipulation
**Authors**: Shenyi Zhang, Yuchen Zhai, Keyan Guo, Hongxin Hu, Shengnan Guo, Zheng Fang, Lingchen Zhao, Chao Shen, Cong Wang, Qian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:50:50Z

**Summary**: Despite the implementation of safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which undermine these safety guardrails and pose significant security threats. Some defenses have been proposed to detect or mitigate jailbreaks, but they are unable to withstand the test of time due to an insufficient understanding of jailbreak mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural networks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden representations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts as toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that manipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through concept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic concepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts. However, unlike harmful prompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM output from rejection to compliance. Building on our analysis, we propose a comprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key components: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M. JBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input activates both toxic and jailbreak concepts. When a jailbreak prompt is detected, JBShield-M adjusts the hidden representations of the target LLM by enhancing the toxic concept and weakening the jailbreak concept, ensuring LLMs produce safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of JBShield, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.95 and reducing the average attack success rate of various jailbreak attacks to 2% from 61% across distinct LLMs.

### O1 Embedder: Let Retrievers Think Before Action
**Authors**: Ruin Yan, Zheng Liu, Defu Lian

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:48:10Z

**Summary**: The growing power of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized how people access and utilize information. Notably, the LLMs excel at performing fine-grained data representation, which facilitates precise retrieval of information. They also generate high-quality answers based on external references, enabling the production of useful knowledge. The recent introduction of reasoning models, like OpenAI O1 and DeepSeek R1, marks another leap forward, highlighting LLMs' ability to think progressively before delivering final answers. This breakthrough significantly improves the ability to address complex tasks, e.g., coding and math proofs.   Inspired by this progress, we aim to develop similar capabilities for retrieval models, which hold great promise for tackling critical challenges in the field, including multi-task retrieval, zero-shot retrieval, and tasks requiring intensive reasoning of complex relationships. With this motivation, we propose a novel approach called O1 Embedder, which generates useful thoughts for the input query before making retrieval for the target documents. To realize this objective, we conquer two technical difficulties. First, we design a data synthesis workflow, creating training signals for O1 Embedder by generating initial thoughts from an LLM-expert and subsequently refining them using a retrieval committee. Second, we optimize the training process, enabling a pre-trained model to be jointly fine-tuned to generate retrieval thoughts via behavior cloning and perform dense retrieval through contrastive learning. Our approach is evaluated by comprehensive experiments, where substantial improvements are achieved across 12 popular datasets, spanning both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. These results highlight O1 Embedder's remarkable accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for the development of next-generation IR foundation models.

### Autonomous localization of multiple ionizing radiation sources using   miniature single-layer Compton cameras onboard a group of micro aerial   vehicles
**Authors**: Michal Werner, Tomáš Báča, Petr Štibinger, Daniela Doubravová, Jaroslav Šolc, Jan Rusňák, Martin Saska

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:43:25Z

**Summary**: A novel method for autonomous localization of multiple sources of gamma radiation using a group of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is presented in this paper. The method utilizes an extremely lightweight (44 g) Compton camera MiniPIX TPX3. The compact size of the detector allows for deployment onboard safe and agile small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed radiation mapping approach fuses measurements from multiple distributed Compton camera sensors to accurately estimate the positions of multiple radioactive sources in real time. Unlike commonly used intensity-based detectors, the Compton camera reconstructs the set of possible directions towards a radiation source from just a single ionizing particle. Therefore, the proposed approach can localize radiation sources without having to estimate the gradient of a radiation field or contour lines, which require longer measurements. The instant estimation is able to fully exploit the potential of highly mobile MAVs. The radiation mapping method is combined with an active search strategy, which coordinates the future actions of the MAVs in order to improve the quality of the estimate of the sources' positions, as well as to explore the area of interest faster. The proposed solution is evaluated in simulation and real world experiments with multiple Cesium-137 radiation sources.

### Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements   Traceability
**Authors**: Romina Etezadi, Sallam Abualhaija, Chetan Arora, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:16:29Z

**Summary**: New regulations are continuously introduced to ensure that software development complies with the ethical concerns and prioritizes public safety. A prerequisite for demonstrating compliance involves tracing software requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a fundamental task where requirements engineers are supposed to analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often under limited time budget. Doing this analysis manually for complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension introduces additional challenges that only exacerbate manual effort.   In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on large language models (LLMs) to predict trace links between requirements and legal provisions. The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers. The second solution prompts a recent generative LLM based on Rice, a prompt engineering framework.   On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against a baseline classifier from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with an average recall of ~67%, outperforming the baseline with a substantial gain of 54 percentage points (pp) in recall. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European general data protection regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%. On the same documents, however, our Rice-based solution yields an average recall of 84%, with a remarkable gain of about 69 pp over Kashif. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.

### Evaluating Small Language Models for News Summarization: Implications   and Factors Influencing Performance
**Authors**: Borui Xu, Yao Chen, Zeyi Wen, Weiguo Liu, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T13:12:16Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for efficient summarization tools in resource-constrained environments highlights the need for effective solutions. While large language models (LLMs) deliver superior summarization quality, their high computational resource requirements limit practical use applications. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) present a more accessible alternative, capable of real-time summarization on edge devices. However, their summarization capabilities and comparative performance against LLMs remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of 19 SLMs for news summarization across 2,000 news samples, focusing on relevance, coherence, factual consistency, and summary length. Our findings reveal significant variations in SLM performance, with top-performing models such as Phi3-Mini and Llama3.2-3B-Ins achieving results comparable to those of 70B LLMs while generating more concise summaries. Notably, SLMs are better suited for simple prompts, as overly complex prompts may lead to a decline in summary quality. Additionally, our analysis indicates that instruction tuning does not consistently enhance the news summarization capabilities of SLMs. This research not only contributes to the understanding of SLMs but also provides practical insights for researchers seeking efficient summarization solutions that balance performance and resource use.

### Do as We Do, Not as You Think: the Conformity of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Weng, Guikun Chen, Wenguan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:44:39Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) revolutionize the field of intelligent agents, enabling collaborative multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex problems across various domains. However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and groupthink in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems. Our benchmark and code are available at BenchForm.

### Let the Fuzzy Rule Speak: Enhancing In-context Learning Debiasing with   Interpretability
**Authors**: Ruixi Lin, Yang You

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:39:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with balanced class accuracy in text classification tasks using in-context learning (ICL), hindering some practical uses due to user dissatisfaction or safety risks caused by misclassifications. Retraining LLMs to address root causes in data or model priors is neither easy nor cost-effective. This paper delves deeper into the class accuracy imbalance issue, identifying that it arises because certain classes consistently receive disproportionately high ICL probabilities, causing under-prediction and lower accuracy for others. More importantly, probability ranges affect the imbalance differently, allowing for precise, range-specific corrections. We introduce FuRud (Fuzzy Rule Optimization-based Debiasing), a method for sample-level class probability correction. FuRud tackles interpretability challenges by determining why certain classes need corrections and tailoring adjustments for each instance's class probabilities which is powered by fuzzy sets with triangular membership functions, transforming a class probability based on the range it belongs to. By solving a nonlinear integer programming problem with a labeled set of ICL class probabilities to minimize class accuracy bias (COBias) and maximize overall accuracy, each class selects an optimal correction function from 19 triangular membership functions without updating an LLM, and the selected functions correct test instances at inference. Across seven benchmark datasets, FuRud reduces COBias by over half (56%) and improves overall accuracy by 21% relatively, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing methods.

### Zero-Shot Strategies for Length-Controllable Summarization
**Authors**: Fabian Retkowski, Alexander Waibel

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:33:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with precise length control, particularly in zero-shot settings. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating LLMs' length control capabilities across multiple measures and propose practical methods to improve controllability. Our experiments with LLaMA 3 reveal stark differences in length adherence across measures and highlight inherent biases of the model. To address these challenges, we introduce a set of methods: length approximation, target adjustment, sample filtering, and automated revisions. By combining these methods, we demonstrate substantial improvements in length compliance while maintaining or enhancing summary quality, providing highly effective zero-shot strategies for precise length control without the need for model fine-tuning or architectural changes. With our work, we not only advance our understanding of LLM behavior in controlled text generation but also pave the way for more reliable and adaptable summarization systems in real-world applications.

### Polyrating: A Cost-Effective and Bias-Aware Rating System for LLM   Evaluation
**Authors**: Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:21:13Z

**Summary**: Rating-based human evaluation has become an essential tool to accurately evaluate the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current rating systems suffer from several important limitations: first, they fail to account for biases that significantly influence evaluation results, second, they require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and third, they do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Further, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.

### Harnessing Language's Fractal Geometry with Recursive Inference Scaling
**Authors**: Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Xiaohua Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:11:40Z

**Summary**: Recent research in language modeling reveals two scaling effects: the well-known improvement from increased training compute, and a lesser-known boost from applying more sophisticated or computationally intensive inference methods. Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time. For a given fixed model architecture and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. These advantages are maintained even when compared to state-of-the-art recursive techniques like the "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM. Finally, stochastic RINS not only can enhance performance further but also provides the flexibility to optionally forgo increased inference computation at test time with minimal performance degradation.

### Mediator: Memory-efficient LLM Merging with Less Parameter Conflicts and   Uncertainty Based Routing
**Authors**: Kunfeng Lai, Zhenheng Tang, Xinglin Pan, Peijie Dong, Xiang Liu, Haolan Chen, Li Shen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T12:09:51Z

**Summary**: Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.

### LLM-Sketch: Enhancing Network Sketches with LLM
**Authors**: Yuanpeng Li, Zhen Xu, Zongwei Lv, Yannan Hu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:54:56Z

**Summary**: Network stream mining is fundamental to many network operations. Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.

### GANQ: GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Pengxiang Zhao, Xiaoming Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:50:15Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial resource requirements. While low-bit quantized weights can reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency, current hardware lacks native support for mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM), resulting in inefficient dequantization-based implementations. Moreover, uniform quantization methods often fail to capture weight distributions adequately, leading to performance degradation. We propose GANQ (GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization), a layer-wise post-training non-uniform quantization framework optimized for hardware-efficient lookup table-based mpGEMM. GANQ achieves superior quantization performance by utilizing a training-free, GPU-adaptive optimization algorithm to efficiently reduce layer-wise quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate GANQ's ability to reduce the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline compared to state-of-the-art methods for both 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, when deployed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, GANQ's quantized models achieve up to 2.57$\times$ speedup over the baseline, advancing memory and inference efficiency in LLM deployment.

### Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn   More
**Authors**: Xialie Zhuang, Zhikai Jia, Jianjin Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Li Shen, Zheng Cao, Shiwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:49:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multilingual Code Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Jian Yang, Wei Zhang, Jiaxi Yang, Yibo Miao, Shanghaoran Quan, Zhenhe Wu, Qiyao Peng, Liqun Yang, Tianyu Liu, Zeyu Cui, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:46:38Z

**Summary**: Recent advancement in code understanding and generation demonstrates that code LLMs fine-tuned on a high-quality instruction dataset can gain powerful capabilities to address wide-ranging code-related tasks. However, most previous existing methods mainly view each programming language in isolation and ignore the knowledge transfer among different programming languages. To bridge the gap among different programming languages, we introduce a novel multi-agent collaboration framework to enhance multilingual instruction tuning for code LLMs, where multiple language-specific intelligent agent components with generation memory work together to transfer knowledge from one language to another efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we first generate the language-specific instruction data from the code snippets and then provide the generated data as the seed data for language-specific agents. Multiple language-specific agents discuss and collaborate to formulate a new instruction and its corresponding solution (A new programming language or existing programming language), To further encourage the cross-lingual transfer, each agent stores its generation history as memory and then summarizes its merits and faults. Finally, the high-quality multilingual instruction data is used to encourage knowledge transfer among different programming languages to train Qwen2.5-xCoder. Experimental results on multilingual programming benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Qwen2.5-xCoder in sharing common knowledge, highlighting its potential to reduce the cross-lingual gap.

### Limits to scalable evaluation at the frontier: LLM as Judge won't beat   twice the data
**Authors**: Florian E. Dorner, Vivian Y. Nastl, Moritz Hardt

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:39:18Z

**Summary**: High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.

### ETimeline: An Extensive Timeline Generation Dataset based on Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Xiaochen Liu, Yanan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:34:33Z

**Summary**: Timeline generation is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the development of events over time. Its goal is to organize news chronologically, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be obscured when viewing news in isolation, making it easier to track the development of stories and understand the interrelationships between key events. Timelines are now common in various commercial products, but academic research in this area is notably scarce. Additionally, the current datasets are in need of refinement for enhanced utility and expanded coverage. In this paper, we propose ETimeline, which encompasses over $13,000$ news articles, spanning $600$ bilingual timelines across $28$ news domains. Specifically, we gather a candidate pool of more than $120,000$ news articles and employ the large language model (LLM) Pipeline to improve performance, ultimately yielding the ETimeline. The data analysis underscores the appeal of ETimeline. Additionally, we also provide the news pool data for further research and analysis. This work contributes to the advancement of timeline generation research and supports a wide range of tasks, including topic generation and event relationships. We believe that this dataset will serve as a catalyst for innovative research and bridge the gap between academia and industry in understanding the practical application of technology services. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/11392212

### 5D Neural Surrogates for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Simulations of Plasma   Turbulence
**Authors**: Gianluca Galletti, Fabian Paischer, Paul Setinek, William Hornsby, Lorenzo Zanisi, Naomi Carey, Stanislas Pamela, Johannes Brandstetter

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:25:10Z

**Summary**: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge, making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production via nuclear fusion.

### SampleLLM: Optimizing Tabular Data Synthesis in Recommendations
**Authors**: Jingtong Gao, Zhaocheng Du, Xiaopeng Li, Yichao Wang, Xiangyang Li, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang, Xiangyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:19:40Z

**Summary**: Tabular data synthesis is crucial in machine learning, yet existing general methods-primarily based on statistical or deep learning models-are highly data-dependent and often fall short in recommender systems. This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding. However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset. To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited. The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM. Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios.

### Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Heyang Zhao, Chenlu Ye, Wei Xiong, Quanquan Gu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:11:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.

### PerCul: A Story-Driven Cultural Evaluation of LLMs in Persian
**Authors**: Erfan Moosavi Monazzah, Vahid Rahimzadeh, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh, Azadeh Shakery, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:07:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models predominantly reflect Western cultures, largely due to the dominance of English-centric training data. This imbalance presents a significant challenge, as LLMs are increasingly used across diverse contexts without adequate evaluation of their cultural competence in non-English languages, including Persian. To address this gap, we introduce PerCul, a carefully constructed dataset designed to assess the sensitivity of LLMs toward Persian culture. PerCul features story-based, multiple-choice questions that capture culturally nuanced scenarios. Unlike existing benchmarks, PerCul is curated with input from native Persian annotators to ensure authenticity and to prevent the use of translation as a shortcut. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual and Persian-specific LLMs, establishing a foundation for future research in cross-cultural NLP evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate a 11.3% gap between best closed source model and layperson baseline while the gap increases to 21.3% by using the best open-weight model. You can access the dataset from here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/teias-ai/percul

### Improving Autoformalization using Type Checking
**Authors**: Auguste Poiroux, Gail Weiss, Viktor Kunčak, Antoine Bosselut

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T11:02:10Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization, the automatic translation of unconstrained natural language into formal languages, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in theorem proving, formal verification, and LLM output checking. In this work, we analyze both current autoformalization methods and the processes used to evaluate them, focusing specifically on the Lean 4 theorem proving language. We demonstrate that scaling type-check filtering with self-consistency techniques on top of existing methods significantly improves performance, achieving absolute accuracy gains of up to +18.4\% on ProofNet. To support reproducibility and further research, we release our code, including new symbolic equivalence for Lean formulas. We also release new benchmarks: a new research-level mathematics dataset RLM25, a corrected ProofNet, and ProofNetVerif with labeled correct and incorrect autoformalization pairs for evaluating metrics.

### Vulnerability-Triggering Test Case Generation from Third-Party Libraries
**Authors**: Yi Gao, Xing Hu, Zirui Chen, Xiaohu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:53:20Z

**Summary**: Open-source third-party libraries are widely used in software development. These libraries offer substantial advantages in terms of time and resource savings. However, a significant concern arises due to the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within these libraries. Existing automated vulnerability detection tools often suffer from false positives and fail to accurately assess the propagation of inputs capable of triggering vulnerabilities from client projects to vulnerable code in libraries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called VULEUT (Vulnerability Exploit Unit Test Generation), which combines vulnerability exploitation reachability analysis and LLM-based unit test generation. VULEUT is designed to automatically verify the exploitability of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries commonly used in client software projects. VULEUT first analyzes the client projects to determine the reachability of vulnerability conditions. And then, it leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate unit tests for vulnerability confirmation. To evaluate the effectiveness of VULEUT, we collect 32 vulnerabilities from various third-party libraries and conduct experiments on 70 real client projects. Besides, we also compare our approach with two representative tools, i.e., TRANSFER and VESTA. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of VULEUT, with 229 out of 292 generated unit tests successfully confirming vulnerability exploitation across 70 client projects, which outperforms baselines by 24%.

### Automated Unit Test Refactoring
**Authors**: Yi Gao, Xing Hu, Xiaohu Yang, Xin Xia

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:52:54Z

**Summary**: Test smells arise from poor design practices and insufficient domain knowledge, which can lower the quality of test code and make it harder to maintain and update. Manually refactoring test smells is time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the necessity for automated approaches. Current rule-based refactoring methods often struggle in scenarios not covered by predefined rules and lack the flexibility needed to handle diverse cases effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called UTRefactor, a context-enhanced, LLM-based framework for automatic test refactoring in Java projects. UTRefactor extracts relevant context from test code and leverages an external knowledge base that includes test smell definitions, descriptions, and DSL-based refactoring rules. By simulating the manual refactoring process through a chain-of-thought approach, UTRefactor guides the LLM to eliminate test smells in a step-by-step process, ensuring both accuracy and consistency throughout the refactoring. Additionally, we implement a checkpoint mechanism to facilitate comprehensive refactoring, particularly when multiple smells are present. We evaluate UTRefactor on 879 tests from six open-source Java projects, reducing the number of test smells from 2,375 to 265, achieving an 89% reduction. UTRefactor outperforms direct LLM-based refactoring methods by 61.82% in smell elimination and significantly surpasses the performance of a rule-based test smell refactoring tool. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of UTRefactor in enhancing test code quality while minimizing manual involvement.

### Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon
**Authors**: Nurit Cohen-Inger, Yehonatan Elisha, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach, Seffi Cohen

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:43:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.

### Approximating Human Strategic Reasoning with LLM-Enhanced Recursive   Reasoners Leveraging Multi-agent Hypergames
**Authors**: Vince Trencsenyi, Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:37:20Z

**Summary**: LLM-driven multi-agent-based simulations have been gaining traction with applications in game-theoretic and social simulations. While most implementations seek to exploit or evaluate LLM-agentic reasoning, they often do so with a weak notion of agency and simplified architectures. We implement a role-based multi-agent strategic interaction framework tailored to sophisticated recursive reasoners, providing the means for systematic in-depth development and evaluation of strategic reasoning. Our game environment is governed by the umpire responsible for facilitating games, from matchmaking through move validation to environment management. Players incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs in their decision mechanism, relying on a formal hypergame-based model of hierarchical beliefs. We use one-shot, 2-player beauty contests to evaluate the recursive reasoning capabilities of the latest LLMs, providing a comparison to an established baseline model from economics and data from human experiments. Furthermore, we introduce the foundations of an alternative semantic measure of reasoning to the k-level theory. Our experiments show that artificial reasoners can outperform the baseline model in terms of both approximating human behaviour and reaching the optimal solution.

### The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Avner Seror

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:35:02Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into decision-making across various sectors, key questions arise: do they exhibit an emergent "moral mind" - a consistent set of moral principles guiding their ethical judgments - and is this reasoning uniform or diverse across models? To investigate this, we presented approximately forty models from major providers with a structured set of ethical scenarios, creating one of the largest datasets of its kind. Our rationality tests revealed that at least one model from each provider exhibited behavior consistent with approximately stable moral principles, effectively acting as if nearly optimizing a utility function encoding ethical reasoning. We estimated these utility functions and found that models tend to cluster around neutral ethical stances. To further characterize moral heterogeneity, we applied a non-parametric permutation approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed preference patterns. This analysis showed that while approximately rational models share a core ethical structure, differences emerged: roughly half displayed greater moral adaptability, bridging diverse perspectives, while the remainder adhered to more rigid ethical structures.

### Optimizing Knowledge Distillation in Transformers: Enabling Multi-Head   Attention without Alignment Barriers
**Authors**: Zhaodong Bing, Linze Li, Jiajun Liang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:24:57Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) in transformers often faces challenges due to misalignment in the number of attention heads between teacher and student models. Existing methods either require identical head counts or introduce projectors to bridge dimensional gaps, limiting flexibility and efficiency. We propose Squeezing-Heads Distillation (SHD), a novel approach that enables seamless knowledge transfer between models with varying head counts by compressing multi-head attention maps via efficient linear approximation. Unlike prior work, SHD eliminates alignment barriers without additional parameters or architectural modifications. Our method dynamically approximates the combined effect of multiple teacher heads into fewer student heads, preserving fine-grained attention patterns while reducing redundancy. Experiments across language (LLaMA, GPT) and vision (DiT, MDT) generative and vision (DeiT) discriminative tasks demonstrate SHD's effectiveness: it outperforms logit-based and feature-alignment KD baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification, image generation language fine-tuning, and language pre-training. The key innovations of flexible head compression, projector-free design, and linear-time complexity make SHD a versatile and scalable solution for distilling modern transformers. This work bridges a critical gap in KD, enabling efficient deployment of compact models without compromising performance.

### Is That Rain? Understanding Effects on Visual Odometry Performance for   Autonomous UAVs and Efficient DNN-based Rain Classification at the Edge
**Authors**: Andrea Albanese, Yanran Wang, Davide Brunelli, David Boyle

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:21:16Z

**Summary**: The development of safe and reliable autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles relies on the ability of the system to recognise and adapt to changes in the local environment based on sensor inputs. State-of-the-art local tracking and trajectory planning are typically performed using camera sensor input to the flight control algorithm, but the extent to which environmental disturbances like rain affect the performance of these systems is largely unknown. In this paper, we first describe the development of an open dataset comprising ~335k images to examine these effects for seven different classes of precipitation conditions and show that a worst-case average tracking error of 1.5 m is possible for a state-of-the-art visual odometry system (VINS-Fusion). We then use the dataset to train a set of deep neural network models suited to mobile and constrained deployment scenarios to determine the extent to which it may be possible to efficiently and accurately classify these `rainy' conditions. The most lightweight of these models (MobileNetV3 small) can achieve an accuracy of 90% with a memory footprint of just 1.28 MB and a frame rate of 93 FPS, which is suitable for deployment in resource-constrained and latency-sensitive systems. We demonstrate a classification latency in the order of milliseconds using typical flight computer hardware. Accordingly, such a model can feed into the disturbance estimation component of an autonomous flight controller. In addition, data from unmanned aerial vehicles with the ability to accurately determine environmental conditions in real time may contribute to developing more granular timely localised weather forecasting.

### RomanLens: Latent Romanization and its role in Multilinguality in LLMs
**Authors**: Alan Saji, Jaavid Aktar Husain, Thanmay Jayakumar, Raj Dabre, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Mitesh M. Khapra, Ratish Puduppully

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:10:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable multilingual generalization despite being predominantly trained on English-centric corpora. A fundamental question arises: how do LLMs achieve such robust multilingual capabilities? For non-Latin script languages, we investigate the role of romanization - the representation of non-Latin scripts using Latin characters - as a bridge in multilingual processing. Using mechanistic interpretability techniques, we analyze next-token generation and find that intermediate layers frequently represent target words in romanized form before transitioning to native script, a phenomenon we term Latent Romanization. Further, through activation patching experiments, we demonstrate that LLMs encode semantic concepts similarly across native and romanized scripts, suggesting a shared underlying representation. Additionally in translation towards non Latin languages, our findings reveal that when the target language is in romanized form, its representations emerge earlier in the model's layers compared to native script. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of multilingual representation in LLMs and highlight the implicit role of romanization in facilitating language transfer. Our work provides new directions for potentially improving multilingual language modeling and interpretability.

### A comparison of translation performance between DeepL and Supertext
**Authors**: Alex Flückiger, Chantal Amrhein, Tim Graf, Frédéric Odermatt, Martin Pömsl, Philippe Schläpfer, Florian Schottmann, Samuel Läubli

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:06:14Z

**Summary**: As strong machine translation (MT) systems are increasingly based on large language models (LLMs), reliable quality benchmarking requires methods that capture their ability to leverage extended context. This study compares two commercial MT systems -- DeepL and Supertext -- by assessing their performance on unsegmented texts. We evaluate translation quality across four language directions with professional translators assessing segments with full document-level context. While segment-level assessments indicate no strong preference between the systems in most cases, document-level analysis reveals a preference for Supertext in three out of four language directions, suggesting superior consistency across longer texts. We advocate for more context-sensitive evaluation methodologies to ensure that MT quality assessments reflect real-world usability. We release all evaluation data and scripts for further analysis and reproduction at https://github.com/supertext/evaluation_deepl_supertext.

### Re-evaluating Automatic LLM System Ranking for Alignment with Human   Preference
**Authors**: Mingqi Gao, Yixin Liu, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan, Jonathan Bragg, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T10:02:55Z

**Summary**: Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.

### Entity Linking using LLMs for Automated Product Carbon Footprint   Estimation
**Authors**: Steffen Castle, Julian Moreno Schneider, Leonhard Hennig, Georg Rehm

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T09:54:39Z

**Summary**: Growing concerns about climate change and sustainability are driving manufacturers to take significant steps toward reducing their carbon footprints. For these manufacturers, a first step towards this goal is to identify the environmental impact of the individual components of their products. We propose a system leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically map components from manufacturer Bills of Materials (BOMs) to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database entries by using LLMs to expand on available component information. Our approach reduces the need for manual data processing, paving the way for more accessible sustainability practices.

### Extended monocular 3D imaging
**Authors**: Zicheng Shen, Feng Zhao, Yibo Ni, Yuanmu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T09:32:31Z

**Summary**: 3D vision is of paramount importance for numerous applications ranging from machine intelligence to precision metrology. Despite much recent progress, the majority of 3D imaging hardware remains bulky and complicated and provides much lower image resolution compared to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, there are many well-known scenarios that existing 3D imaging solutions frequently fail. Here, we introduce an extended monocular 3D imaging (EM3D) framework that fully exploits the vectorial wave nature of light. Via the multi-stage fusion of diffraction- and polarization-based depth cues, using a compact monocular camera equipped with a diffractive-refractive hybrid lens, we experimentally demonstrate the snapshot acquisition of a million-pixel and accurate 3D point cloud for extended scenes that are traditionally challenging, including those with low texture, being highly reflective, or nearly transparent, without a data prior. Furthermore, we discover that the combination of depth and polarization information can unlock unique new opportunities in material identification, which may further expand machine intelligence for applications like target recognition and face anti-spoofing. The straightforward yet powerful architecture thus opens up a new path for a higher-dimensional machine vision in a minimal form factor, facilitating the deployment of monocular cameras for applications in much more diverse scenarios.

### On Iterative Evaluation and Enhancement of Code Quality Using GPT-4o
**Authors**: Rundong Liu, Andre Frade, Amal Vaidya, Maxime Labonne, Marcus Kaiser, Bismayan Chakrabarti, Jonathan Budd, Sean Moran

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T09:27:00Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces CodeQUEST, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to iteratively evaluate and enhance code quality across multiple dimensions, including readability, maintainability, efficiency, and security. The framework is divided into two main components: an Evaluator that assesses code quality across ten dimensions, providing both quantitative scores and qualitative summaries, and an Optimizer that iteratively improves the code based on the Evaluator's feedback. Our study demonstrates that CodeQUEST can effectively and robustly evaluate code quality, with its assessments aligning closely with established code quality metrics. Through a series of experiments using a curated dataset of Python and JavaScript examples, CodeQUEST demonstrated significant improvements in code quality, achieving a mean relative percentage improvement of 52.6%. The framework's evaluations were validated against a set of proxy metrics comprising of Pylint Score, Radon Maintainability Index, and Bandit output logs, showing a meaningful correlation. This highlights the potential of LLMs in automating code quality evaluation and improvement processes, presenting a significant advancement toward enhancing software development practices. The code implementation of the framework is available at: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/CodeQuest.

### Target-Augmented Shared Fusion-based Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation   Generation
**Authors**: Palaash Goel, Dushyant Singh Chauhan, Md Shad Akhtar

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T09:19:46Z

**Summary**: Sarcasm is a linguistic phenomenon that intends to ridicule a target (e.g., entity, event, or person) in an inherent way. Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE) aims at revealing the intended irony in a sarcastic post using a natural language explanation. Though important, existing systems overlooked the significance of the target of sarcasm in generating explanations. In this paper, we propose a Target-aUgmented shaRed fusion-Based sarcasm explanatiOn model, aka. TURBO. We design a novel shared-fusion mechanism to leverage the inter-modality relationships between an image and its caption. TURBO assumes the target of the sarcasm and guides the multimodal shared fusion mechanism in learning intricacies of the intended irony for explanations. We evaluate our proposed TURBO model on the MORE+ dataset. Comparison against multiple baselines and state-of-the-art models signifies the performance improvement of TURBO by an average margin of $+3.3\%$. Moreover, we explore LLMs in zero and one-shot settings for our task and observe that LLM-generated explanation, though remarkable, often fails to capture the critical nuances of the sarcasm. Furthermore, we supplement our study with extensive human evaluation on TURBO's generated explanations and find them out to be comparatively better than other systems.

### LLMs Can Easily Learn to Reason from Demonstrations Structure, not   content, is what matters!
**Authors**: Dacheng Li, Shiyi Cao, Tyler Griggs, Shu Liu, Xiangxi Mo, Shishir G. Patil, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica

**Summary**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation. However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models. This is the academic paper of our previous released Sky-T1-32B-Preview model. Codes are available at https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought.

### EvoFlow: Evolving Diverse Agentic Workflows On The Fly
**Authors**: Guibin Zhang, Kaijie Chen, Guancheng Wan, Heng Chang, Hong Cheng, Kun Wang, Shuyue Hu, Lei Bai

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:48:46Z

**Summary**: The past two years have witnessed the evolution of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems from labor-intensive manual design to partial automation (\textit{e.g.}, prompt engineering, communication topology) and eventually to fully automated design. However, existing agentic automation pipelines often lack LLM heterogeneity and focus on single-objective performance optimization, limiting their potential to combine weaker models for more customized and cost-effective solutions. To address this challenge, we propose EvoFlow, a niching evolutionary algorithm-based framework to automatically search a population of heterogeneous and complexity-adaptive agentic workflows, rather than a single homogeneous, complex workflow. Technically, EvoFlow performs \textit{(1) tag-based retrieval} to extract parent workflows from an agentic population, evolves new workflows through \textit{(2) crossover} and \textit{(3) mutation}, and employs \textit{(4) niching-based selection} to maintain population diversity and quality. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmarks demonstrate that EvoFlow is: \textbf{(I) diverse}, evolving a population of workflows ranging from simple I/O tasks to complex multi-turn interactions; \textbf{(II) high-performing}, outperforming previous handcrafted and automated workflows by $1.23\%\sim29.86\%$; \textbf{(III) economical}, surpassing powerful \llmname{o1-preview} at $12.4\%$ of its inference cost using weaker open-source models.

### USRNet: Unified Scene Recovery Network for Enhancing Traffic Imaging   under Multiple Adverse Weather Conditions
**Authors**: Yuxu Lu, Ai Chen, Dong Yang, Ryan Wen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:47:58Z

**Summary**: Advancements in computer vision technology have facilitated the extensive deployment of intelligent transportation systems and visual surveillance systems across various applications, including autonomous driving, public safety, and environmental monitoring. However, adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly degrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM), an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios. The code resources for this work can be accessed in https://github.com/LouisYxLu/USRNet.

### LongReD: Mitigating Short-Text Degradation of Long-Context Large   Language Models via Restoration Distillation
**Authors**: Zican Dong, Junyi Li, Jinhao Jiang, Mingyu Xu, Wayne Xin Zhao, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:37:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have gained extended context windows through scaling positional encodings and lightweight continual pre-training. However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common text benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining comparable or even better capacity to handle long texts than baselines.

### Bridging the Evaluation Gap: Leveraging Large Language Models for Topic   Model Evaluation
**Authors**: Zhiyin Tan, Jennifer D'Souza

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:23:56Z

**Summary**: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically evolving topic taxonomies in scientific literature using Large Language Models (LLMs). In digital library systems, topic modeling plays a crucial role in efficiently organizing and retrieving scholarly content, guiding researchers through complex knowledge landscapes. As research domains proliferate and shift, traditional human centric and static evaluation methods struggle to maintain relevance. The proposed approach harnesses LLMs to measure key quality dimensions, such as coherence, repetitiveness, diversity, and topic-document alignment, without heavy reliance on expert annotators or narrow statistical metrics. Tailored prompts guide LLM assessments, ensuring consistent and interpretable evaluations across various datasets and modeling techniques. Experiments on benchmark corpora demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and adaptability, underscoring its value as a more holistic and dynamic alternative to conventional evaluation strategies.

**Authors**: Almog Gueta, Amir Feder, Zorik Gekhman, Ariel Goldstein, Roi Reichart

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:22:35Z

**Summary**: This study empirically tests the $\textit{Narrative Economics}$ hypothesis, which posits that narratives (ideas that are spread virally and affect public beliefs) can influence economic fluctuations. We introduce two curated datasets containing posts from X (formerly Twitter) which capture economy-related narratives (Data will be shared upon paper acceptance). Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we extract and summarize narratives from the tweets. We test their predictive power for $\textit{macroeconomic}$ forecasting by incorporating the tweets' or the extracted narratives' representations in downstream financial prediction tasks. Our work highlights the challenges in improving macroeconomic models with narrative data, paving the way for the research community to realistically address this important challenge. From a scientific perspective, our investigation offers valuable insights and NLP tools for narrative extraction and summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs), contributing to future research on the role of narratives in economics.

### BenchMAX: A Comprehensive Multilingual Evaluation Suite for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Xu Huang, Wenhao Zhu, Hanxu Hu, Conghui He, Lei Li, Shujian Huang, Fei Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:17:19Z

**Summary**: Previous multilingual benchmarks focus primarily on simple understanding tasks, but for large language models(LLMs), we emphasize proficiency in instruction following, reasoning, long context understanding, code generation, and so on. However, measuring these advanced capabilities across languages is underexplored. To address the disparity, we introduce BenchMAX, a multi-way multilingual evaluation benchmark that allows for fair comparisons of these important abilities across languages. To maintain high quality, three distinct native-speaking annotators independently annotate each sample within all tasks after the data was machine-translated from English into 16 other languages. Additionally, we present a novel translation challenge stemming from dataset construction. Extensive experiments on BenchMAX reveal varying effectiveness of core capabilities across languages, highlighting performance gaps that cannot be bridged by simply scaling up model size. BenchMAX serves as a comprehensive multilingual evaluation platform, providing a promising test bed to promote the development of multilingual language models. The dataset and code are publicly accessible.

### Aligning Large Language Models to Follow Instructions and Hallucinate   Less via Effective Data Filtering
**Authors**: Shuzheng Si, Haozhe Zhao, Gang Chen, Cheng Gao, Yuzhuo Bai, Zhitong Wang, Kaikai An, Kangyang Luo, Chen Qian, Fanchao Qi, Baobao Chang, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T08:05:56Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs on data that contains unfamiliar knowledge during the instruction tuning stage can make LLMs overconfident and encourage hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, NOVA, which identifies high-quality data that aligns well with the LLM's learned knowledge to reduce hallucinations. NOVA includes Internal Consistency Probing (ICP) and Semantic Equivalence Identification (SEI) to measure how familiar the LLM is with instruction data. Specifically, ICP evaluates the LLM's understanding of the given instruction by calculating the tailored consistency among multiple self-generated responses. SEI further assesses the familiarity of the LLM with the target response by comparing it to the generated responses, using the proposed semantic clustering and well-designed voting strategy. Finally, we introduce an expert-aligned reward model, considering characteristics beyond just familiarity to enhance data quality. By considering data quality and avoiding unfamiliar data, we can utilize the selected data to effectively align LLMs to follow instructions and hallucinate less. Extensive experiments and analysis show that NOVA significantly reduces hallucinations and allows LLMs to maintain a strong ability to follow instructions.

### Semantic to Structure: Learning Structural Representations for   Infringement Detection
**Authors**: Chuanwei Huang, Zexi Jia, Hongyan Fei, Yeshuang Zhu, Zhiqiang Yuan, Jinchao Zhang, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T07:42:44Z

**Summary**: Structural information in images is crucial for aesthetic assessment, and it is widely recognized in the artistic field that imitating the structure of other works significantly infringes on creators' rights. The advancement of diffusion models has led to AI-generated content imitating artists' structural creations, yet effective detection methods are still lacking. In this paper, we define this phenomenon as "structural infringement" and propose a corresponding detection method. Additionally, we develop quantitative metrics and create manually annotated datasets for evaluation: the SIA dataset of synthesized data, and the SIR dataset of real data. Due to the current lack of datasets for structural infringement detection, we propose a new data synthesis strategy based on diffusion models and LLM, successfully training a structural infringement detection model. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect structural infringements and achieve notable improvements on annotated test sets.

### MEMIT-Merge: Addressing MEMIT's Key-Value Conflicts in Same-Subject   Batch Editing for LLMs
**Authors**: Zilu Dong, Xiangqing Shen, Rui Xia

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T07:42:09Z

**Summary**: As large language models continue to scale up, knowledge editing techniques that modify models' internal knowledge without full retraining have gained significant attention. MEMIT, a prominent batch editing algorithm, stands out for its capability to perform mass knowledge modifications. However, we uncover a critical limitation that MEMIT's editing efficacy significantly deteriorates when processing batches containing multiple edits sharing the same subject. Our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in MEMIT's key value modeling framework: When multiple facts with the same subject in a batch are modeled through MEMIT's key value mechanism, identical keys (derived from the shared subject) are forced to represent different values (corresponding to different knowledge), resulting in updates conflicts during editing. Addressing this issue, we propose MEMIT-Merge, an enhanced approach that merges value computation processes for facts sharing the same subject, effectively resolving the performance degradation in same-subject batch editing scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that when MEMIT's edit success rate drops to around 50% at larger batch sizes, MEMIT-Merge maintains a success rate exceeding 90%, showcasing remarkable robustness to subject entity collisions.

### Large Memory Network for Recommendation
**Authors**: Hui Lu, Zheng Chai, Yuchao Zheng, Zhe Chen, Deping Xie, Peng Xu, Xun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T07:36:07Z

**Summary**: Modeling user behavior sequences in recommender systems is essential for understanding user preferences over time, enabling personalized and accurate recommendations for improving user retention and enhancing business values. Despite its significance, there are two challenges for current sequential modeling approaches. From the spatial dimension, it is difficult to mutually perceive similar users' interests for a generalized intention understanding; from the temporal dimension, current methods are generally prone to forgetting long-term interests due to the fixed-length input sequence. In this paper, we present Large Memory Network (LMN), providing a novel idea by compressing and storing user history behavior information in a large-scale memory block. With the elaborated online deployment strategy, the memory block can be easily scaled up to million-scale in the industry. Extensive offline comparison experiments, memory scaling up experiments, and online A/B test on Douyin E-Commerce Search (ECS) are performed, validating the superior performance of LMN. Currently, LMN has been fully deployed in Douyin ECS, serving millions of users each day.

### FlexSP: Accelerating Large Language Model Training via Flexible Sequence   Parallelism
**Authors**: Yujie Wang, Shiju Wang, Shenhan Zhu, Fangcheng Fu, Xinyi Liu, Xuefeng Xiao, Huixia Li, Jiashi Li, Faming Wu, Bin Cui

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T07:31:03Z

**Summary**: Extending the context length (i.e., the maximum supported sequence length) of LLMs is of paramount significance. To facilitate long context training of LLMs, sequence parallelism has emerged as an essential technique, which scatters each input sequence across multiple devices and necessitates communication to process the sequence. In essence, existing sequence parallelism methods assume homogeneous sequence lengths (i.e., all input sequences are equal in length) and therefore leverages a single, static scattering strategy for all input sequences. However, in reality, the sequence lengths in LLM training corpora exhibit substantial variability, often following a long-tail distribution, which leads to workload heterogeneity.   In this paper, we show that employing a single, static strategy results in inefficiency and resource under-utilization, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches to handle the heterogeneous workloads across sequences. To address this, we propose a heterogeneity-adaptive sequence parallelism method. For each training step, our approach captures the variability in sequence lengths and assigns the optimal combination of scattering strategies based on workload characteristics. We model this problem as a linear programming optimization and design an efficient and effective solver to find the optimal solution. Furthermore, we implement our method in a high-performance system that supports adaptive parallelization in distributed LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art training frameworks by up to 1.98x.

**Summary**: We study prompting-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) for modifying documents so as to promote their ranking in a competitive search setting. Our methods are inspired by prior work on leveraging LLMs as rankers. We evaluate our approach by deploying it as a bot in previous ranking competitions and in competitions we organized. Our findings demonstrate that our approach effectively improves document ranking while preserving high levels of faithfulness to the original content and maintaining overall document quality.

### CreAgent: Towards Long-Term Evaluation of Recommender System under   Platform-Creator Information Asymmetry
**Authors**: Xiaopeng Ye, Chen Xu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Gang Wang, Zhenhua Dong, Ji-Rong Wen

**Updated**: 2025-02-11T07:09:49Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the long-term sustainability of recommender systems (RS) emerges as a crucial issue. Traditional offline evaluation methods for RS typically focus on immediate user feedback, such as clicks, but they often neglect the long-term impact of content creators. On real-world content platforms, creators can strategically produce and upload new items based on user feedback and preference trends. While previous studies have attempted to model creator behavior, they often overlook the role of information asymmetry. This asymmetry arises because creators primarily have access to feedback on the items they produce, while platforms possess data on the entire spectrum of user feedback. Current RS simulators, however, fail to account for this asymmetry, leading to inaccurate long-term evaluations. To address this gap, we propose CreAgent, a Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered creator simulation agent. By incorporating game theory's belief mechanism and the fast-and-slow thinking framework, CreAgent effectively simulates creator behavior under conditions of information asymmetry. Additionally, we enhance CreAgent's simulation ability by fine-tuning it using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our credibility validation experiments show that CreAgent aligns well with the behaviors between real-world platform and creator, thus improving the reliability of long-term RS evaluations. Moreover, through the simulation of RS involving CreAgents, we can explore how fairness- and diversity-aware RS algorithms contribute to better long-term performance for various stakeholders. CreAgent and the simulation platform are publicly available at https://github.com/shawnye2000/CreAgent.
