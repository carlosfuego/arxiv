**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:12:09Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:36:19Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention concentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance representation across most layers.

**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:29:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:51:10Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

**Summary**: Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T20:39:56Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders
**Authors**: Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T18:59:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

### Local and Regional Contributions to Tropospheric Ozone Concentrations
**Authors**: Callum E. Flowerday, Ryan Thalman, Jaron C. Hansen

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T16:10:26Z

**Summary**: The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:57:03Z

**Summary**: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

**Authors**: Tiancheng Zhao, Peng Liu, Xuan He, Lu Zhang, Kyusong Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:24:20Z

**Summary**: End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

### Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware   Masking
**Authors**: Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:07:51Z

**Summary**: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.

### Memory-Efficient Training for Deep Speaker Embedding Learning in Speaker   Verification
**Authors**: Bei Liu, Yanmin Qian

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:57:46Z

**Summary**: Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.

### JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Zemin Sun, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:30:04Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

### Optimal Power Allocation in Uplink NOMA with Simultaneous Cache-Enabled   D2D Communications
**Authors**: Aditya Powari, Daniel K. C. So

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T21:47:35Z

**Summary**: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.

### Advanced Video Inpainting Using Optical Flow-Guided Efficient Diffusion
**Authors**: Bohai Gu, Hao Luo, Song Guo, Peiran Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T15:45:26Z

**Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

### SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding for Interactive LLM   Inference on Consumer Devices
**Authors**: Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin

**Updated**: 2024-11-30T21:33:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

**Authors**: Thijs Steel, Julien Langou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:21:12Z

**Summary**: We present an efficient algorithm for the application of sequences of planar rotations to a matrix. Applying such sequences efficiently is important in many numerical linear algebra algorithms for eigenvalues. Our algorithm is novel in three main ways. First, we introduce a new kernel that is optimized for register reuse in a novel way. Second, we introduce a blocking and packing scheme that improves the cache efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we thoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to important theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware.

### KV Shifting Attention Enhances Language Modeling
**Authors**: Mingyu Xu, Wei Cheng, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T09:42:38Z

**Summary**: The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention.

### DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and   Verifiable Credentials
**Authors**: Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Dennis Natusch, Artur Philipp, Axel Küpper, Hans Joachim Einsiedler, Daniela Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Ravi Netravali, Yida Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T21:10:20Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching
**Authors**: Xiaofan Niu, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:35:22Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

### Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:42:54Z

**Summary**: We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T12:50:05Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T02:01:50Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:59:48Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:09:29Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines
**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### FastSwitch: Optimizing Context Switching Efficiency in Fairness-aware   Large Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Ao Shen, Zhiyao Li, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T15:07:28Z

**Summary**: Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

### Accelerating Vision Diffusion Transformers with Skip Branches
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T14:43:46Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.git.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T08:21:47Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### A Method for Building Large Language Models with Predefined KV Cache   Capacity
**Authors**: Zhonghua Yi, Ge Niu, Lei Wang, Wei Tang, Liqiu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T03:07:20Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

### Attamba: Attending To Multi-Token States
**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Safeen Huda, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:52:06Z

**Summary**: When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

### STAR: Synthesis of Tailored Architectures
**Authors**: Armin W. Thomas, Rom Parnichkun, Alexander Amini, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:42:42Z

**Summary**: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T17:28:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### Degrees of Freedom of Cache-Aided Interference Channels Assisted by   Active Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces
**Authors**: Abolfazl Changizi, Ali H. Abdollahi Bafghi, Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T16:21:10Z

**Summary**: This paper studies cache-aided wireless networks in the presence of active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided wireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement, delivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable scheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side information), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the network's parameters. We derive the achievable one-shot sum-DoF for different sizes of cache memories, network configurations, and numbers of IRS elements. Our results highlight the potential of deploying an IRS in cache-aided wireless communication systems, underscoring the enhancement of achievable DoF for various parameter regimes, particularly when the sizes of the caches (especially at the transmitters) are inadequate. Notably, we show that access to an IRS with a sufficient number of elements enables the achievement of the maximum possible DoF for various parameter regimes of interest.

### DreamCache: Finetuning-Free Lightweight Personalized Image Generation   via Feature Caching
**Authors**: Emanuele Aiello, Umberto Michieli, Diego Valsesia, Mete Ozay, Enrico Magli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T15:03:14Z

**Summary**: Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T05:10:04Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy.

### Efficient LLM Inference with I/O-Aware Partial KV Cache Recomputation
**Authors**: Chaoyi Jiang, Lei Gao, Hossein Entezari Zarch, Murali Annavaram

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T04:03:14Z

**Summary**: Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### Ca2-VDM: Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion Model with Causal   Generation and Cache Sharing
**Authors**: Kaifeng Gao, Jiaxin Shi, Hanwang Zhang, Chunping Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T13:33:41Z

**Summary**: With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T12:14:33Z

**Summary**: Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.   We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

### Deegen: A JIT-Capable VM Generator for Dynamic Languages
**Authors**: Haoran Xu, Fredrik Kjolstad

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T21:57:29Z

**Summary**: Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

### Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM   Inference Environments
**Authors**: Nikoleta Iliakopoulou, Jovan Stojkovic, Chloe Alverti, Tianyin Xu, Hubertus Franke, Josep Torrellas

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T16:20:57Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Baoshun Tong, Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T06:43:38Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) has attracted increasing attention for tackling the issue of distribution shift during the test phase. While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time. Code will be available at https://github.com/BaoshunWq/clip-TAEA.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T22:11:42Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

### TASER: Temporal Adaptive Sampling for Fast and Accurate Dynamic Graph   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Gangda Deng, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng, Yinglong Xia, Christopher Leung, Jianbo Li, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T10:42:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

### HRSAM: Efficient Interactive Segmentation in High-Resolution Images
**Authors**: You Huang, Wenbin Lai, Jiayi Ji, Liujuan Cao, Shengchuan Zhang, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T01:44:00Z

**Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.

### Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation of Liver Domes in kV Triggered   Images for Online Breath-hold Reproducibility Verification of Liver   Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
**Authors**: Sugandima Weragoda, Ping Xia, Kevin Stephans, Neil Woody, Michael Martens, Robert Brown, Bingqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T19:30:40Z

**Summary**: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.

### AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out   Context Attribution
**Authors**: Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Colin Raffel

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T18:06:14Z

**Summary**: The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T15:55:19Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for   Scalable Recommendation System
**Authors**: Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:55:43Z

**Summary**: The model size growth of personalized recommendation systems poses new challenges for inference. Weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed for size reduction, but they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) enhanced the model throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but such algorithms introduce massive CPU-PIM communication into prior PIM systems. We propose ProactivePIM, a PIM system for weight-sharing recommendation system acceleration. ProactivePIM integrates a cache within the PIM with a prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate communication overhead through a subtable mapping strategy. ProactivePIM achieves a 4.8x speedup compared to prior works.

### Static Reuse Profile Estimation for Array Applications
**Authors**: Abdur Razzak, Atanu Barai, Nandakishore Santhi, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:26:57Z

**Summary**: Reuse distance analysis is a widely recognized method for application characterization that illustrates cache locality. Although there are various techniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is both time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory traces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a promisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without running the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static analysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an input program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the execution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory accesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a recursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a separate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a temporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller profiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We use this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our model can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to the dynamic reuse profile methods.

### Retrieval-Enhanced Visual Prompt Learning for Few-shot Classification
**Authors**: Jintao Rong, Hao Chen, Linlin Ou, Tianxiao Chen, Xinyi Yu, Yifan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T04:12:53Z

**Summary**: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has been widely used in various downstream vision tasks. The few-shot learning paradigm has been widely adopted to augment its capacity for these tasks. However, current paradigms may struggle with fine-grained classification, such as satellite image recognition, due to widening domain gaps. To address this limitation, we propose retrieval-enhanced visual prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache and reuse the knowledge of downstream tasks. RePrompt constructs a retrieval database from either training examples or external data if available, and uses a retrieval mechanism to enhance multiple stages of a simple prompt learning baseline, thus narrowing the domain gap. During inference, our enhanced model can reference similar samples brought by retrieval to make more accurate predictions. A detailed analysis reveals that retrieval helps to improve the distribution of late features, thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks. Reprompt attains state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision datasets, including 11 image datasets, 3 video datasets, 1 multi-view dataset, and 4 domain generalization benchmarks.

### InstCache: A Predictive Cache for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Longwei Zou, Tingfeng Liu, Kai Chen, Jiangang Kong, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:52:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life. However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.

### WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Aobo Liang, Yan Sun, Nadra Guizani

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:34:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T02:15:52Z

**Summary**: Modern day Language Models see extensive use in text classification, yet this comes at significant computational cost. Compute-effective classification models are needed for low-resource environments, most notably on edge devices. We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:51:25Z

**Summary**: We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.

### MAS-Attention: Memory-Aware Stream Processing for Attention Acceleration   on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mohammadali Shakerdargah, Shan Lu, Chao Gao, Di Niu

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:44:26Z

**Summary**: The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.

**Authors**: Semih Akkurt, Sébastien Lemaire, Paul Bartholomew, Sylvain Laizet

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T18:31:39Z

**Summary**: Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.

**Authors**: Marco Barbisan, Marco Boldrin, Luca Cinnirella, Bruno Laterza, Alberto Maistrello, Lionello Marrelli, Federico Molon, Simone Peruzzo, Cesare Taliercio, Marco Valisa, Enrico Zampiva

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T14:52:36Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T02:04:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T18:24:03Z

**Summary**: In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.

### An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor   decompositions for Bayesian inversion
**Authors**: Vitalii Aksenov, Martin Eigel

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T11:40:56Z

**Summary**: The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

### Adaptive Cache Management for Complex Storage Systems Using   CNN-LSTM-Based Spatiotemporal Prediction
**Authors**: Xiaoye Wang, Xuan Li, Linji Wang, Tingyi Ruan, Pochun Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T01:55:26Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

### Bi-Mamba: Towards Accurate 1-Bit State Space Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Liqun Ma, Haonan Li, Mingjie Sun, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T18:59:15Z

**Summary**: The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T17:08:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

### Accelerating spherical K-means clustering for large-scale sparse   document data
**Authors**: Kazuo Aoyama, Kazumi Saito

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T05:50:58Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

### Unveiling Redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs): A Systematic   Study
**Authors**: Xibo Sun, Jiarui Fang, Aoyu Li, Jinzhe Pan

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:49:23Z

**Summary**: The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/xdit-project/DiTCacheAnalysis.

### LSMGraph: A High-Performance Dynamic Graph Storage System with   Multi-Level CSR
**Authors**: Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Qian Tao, Sijie Shen, Yanfeng Zhang, Wenyuan Yu, Pengxi Liu, Zhixin Zhang, Hongfu Li, Xiaojian Luo, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:10:28Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

### KV-Tandem -- a Modular Approach to Building High-Speed LSM Storage   Engines
**Authors**: Edward Bortnikov, Michael Azran, Asa Bornstein, Shmuel Dashevsky, Dennis Huang, Omer Kepten, Michael Pan, Gali Sheffi, Moshe Twitto, Tamar Weiss Orzech, Idit Keidar, Guy Gueta, Roey Maor, Niv Dayan

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T14:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present~\emph{KV-Tandem}, a modular architecture for building LSM-based storage engines on top of simple, non-ordered persistent key-value stores (KVSs). KV-Tandem enables advanced functionalities such as range queries and snapshot reads, while maintaining the native KVS performance for random reads and writes. Its modular design offers better performance trade-offs compared to previous KV-separation solutions, which struggle to decompose the monolithic LSM structure. Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T12:56:16Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### I Know What You Sync: Covert and Side Channel Attacks on File Systems   via syncfs
**Authors**: Cheng Gu, Yicheng Zhang, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T20:40:08Z

**Summary**: Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

### Efficient Encoder-Decoder Transformer Decoding for Decomposable Tasks
**Authors**: Bo-Ru Lu, Nikita Haduong, Chien-Yu Lin, Hao Cheng, Noah A. Smith, Mari Ostendorf

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T20:39:46Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.

### Multi-Stage Vision Token Dropping: Towards Efficient Multimodal Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Ting Liu, Liangtao Shi, Richang Hong, Yue Hu, Quanjun Yin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T13:45:33Z

**Summary**: The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/liuting20/MustDrop}.

### Learning-to-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Layer Caching
**Authors**: Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Michael Bi Mi, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T07:43:28Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2024-11-16T01:39:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### Can Increasing the Hit Ratio Hurt Cache Throughput? (Long Version)
**Authors**: Ziyue Qiu, Juncheng Yang, Mor Harchol-Balter

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T22:37:48Z

**Summary**: Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

### Forecasting GPU Performance for Deep Learning Training and Inference
**Authors**: Seonho Lee, Amar Phanishayee, Divya Mahajan

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T22:30:38Z

**Summary**: Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

**Authors**: Joseph Liu, Joshua Geddes, Ziyu Guo, Haomiao Jiang, Mahesh Kumar Nandwana

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:24:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:25:54Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Skew-Symmetric Matrix Decompositions on Shared-Memory Architectures
**Authors**: Ishna Satyarth, Chao Yin, RuQing G. Xu, Devin A. Matthews

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:37:31Z

**Summary**: The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra (DLA), particularly in comparison to that of symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. A motivating example is the factorization $X=LTL^T$ of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, which is used in practical applications as a means of determining the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, for example in fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Such applications also often require pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. In this work we explore a combination of known literature algorithms and new algorithms recently derived using formal methods. High-performance parallel CPU implementations are created, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides high-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We find that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via parallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for obtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear and close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing performance.

### Edge Caching Optimization with PPO and Transfer Learning for Dynamic   Environments
**Authors**: Farnaz Niknia, Ping Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T21:01:29Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.

### Architectural Exploration of Application-Specific Resonant SRAM   Compute-in-Memory (rCiM)
**Authors**: Dhandeep Challagundla, Ignatius Bezzam, Riadul Islam

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:01:05Z

**Summary**: While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.

**Authors**: Hanjiang Wu, Huan Xu, Joongun Park, Jesmin Jahan Tithi, Fabio Checconi, Jordi Wolfson-Pou, Fabrizio Petrini, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T14:28:31Z

**Summary**: Influence Maximization (IM) is vital in viral marketing and biological network analysis for identifying key influencers. Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.

### MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory   Augmentation and Scalable Complexity
**Authors**: Xiao Lv, Jiangxia Cao, Shijie Guan, Xiaoyou Zhou, Zhiguang Qi, Yaqiang Zang, Ming Li, Ben Wang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T13:22:41Z

**Summary**: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

### Pie: Pooling CPU Memory for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yi Xu, Ziming Mao, Xiangxi Mo, Shu Liu, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T09:50:41Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of LLMs has revolutionized natural language processing and AI analysis, but their increasing size and memory demands present significant challenges. A common solution is to spill over to CPU memory; however, traditional GPU-CPU memory swapping often results in higher latency and lower throughput.   This paper introduces Pie, an LLM inference framework that addresses these challenges with performance-transparent swapping and adaptive expansion. By leveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern hardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent data swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective memory without added latency. Adaptive expansion dynamically adjusts CPU memory allocation based on real-time information, optimizing memory usage and performance under varying conditions.   Pie maintains low computation latency, high throughput, and high elasticity. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Pie achieves optimal swapping policy during cache warmup and effectively balances increased memory capacity with negligible impact on computation. With its extended capacity, Pie outperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally, Pie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same performance. Compared to FlexGen, an offline profiling-based swapping solution, Pie achieves magnitudes lower latency and 9.4X higher throughput.

### Pkd-tree: Parallel $k$d-tree with Batch Updates
**Authors**: Ziyang Men, Zheqi Shen, Yan Gu, Yihan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T08:25:31Z

**Summary**: The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

### Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with   Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning
**Authors**: Yu Fu, Zefan Cai, Abedelkadir Asi, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T01:56:11Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.Codes are available at https://github.com/FYYFU/HeadKV

### Joint Model Caching and Resource Allocation in Generative AI-Enabled   Wireless Edge Networks
**Authors**: Zhang Liu, Hongyang Du, Lianfen Huang, Zhibin Gao, Dusit Niyato

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T15:07:15Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AIGC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.

### A Novel Extensible Simulation Framework for CXL-Enabled Systems
**Authors**: Yuda An, Shushu Yi, Bo Mao, Qiao Li, Mingzhe Zhang, Ke Zhou, Nong Xiao, Guangyu Sun, Xiaolin Wang, Yingwei Luo, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T03:28:44Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) serves as a rising industry standard, delivering high-speed cache-coherent links to a variety of devices, including host CPUs, computational accelerators, and memory devices. It is designed to promote system scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data transmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has brought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing, device-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the limited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL, earlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote NUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in accurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in hardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology and PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL simulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation framework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to accurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the ground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections within a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to carry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we thoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system topology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics, leading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance CXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3.

**Authors**: Jacopo Tagliabue, Ryan Curtin, Ciro Greco

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Data pre-processing pipelines are the bread and butter of any successful AI project. We introduce a novel programming model for pipelines in a data lakehouse, allowing users to interact declaratively with assets in object storage. Motivated by real-world industry usage patterns, we exploit these new abstractions with a columnar and differential cache to maximize iteration speed for data scientists, who spent most of their time in pre-processing - adding or removing features, restricting or relaxing time windows, wrangling current or older datasets. We show how the new cache works transparently across programming languages, schemas and time windows, and provide preliminary evidence on its efficiency on standard data workloads.

### SKVQ: Sliding-window Key and Value Cache Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Haojie Duanmu, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Jiangfei Duan, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T08:18:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.

### Leveraging Previous Steps: A Training-free Fast Solver for Flow   Diffusion
**Authors**: Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T08:17:15Z

**Summary**: Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

### WDMoE: Wireless Distributed Mixture of Experts for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Xiaodong Xu, Liang Qian, Shuguang Cui, Wenjun Zhang, Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T02:48:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but the role of wireless networks in supporting LLMs has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed Mixture of Experts (WDMoE) architecture to enable collaborative deployment of LLMs across edge servers at the base station (BS) and mobile devices in wireless networks. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This deployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on mobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching resources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for WDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To minimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert selection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover, we build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the effectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the latency without compromising LLM performance.

### Anchor Attention, Small Cache: Code Generation with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Xiangyu Zhang, Yu Zhou, Guang Yang, Harald C. Gall, Taolue Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T02:47:05Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated code generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has hindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common strategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV) states from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by mainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations, but brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use sparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or hallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the attention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical study, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at specific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach, AnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and compress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling cross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition caused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently achieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while preserving the majority of model's performance.

### An Efficient Memory Module for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Dong Li, Aijia Zhang, Junqi Gao, Biqing Qi

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T01:53:14Z

**Summary**: Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation learning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels for node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This makes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods typically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory and perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory consumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and maintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes of learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these prototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the cached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation Adaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype, reducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate. When a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant probabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back into the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the model's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of generalization error and explore the impact of different distillation strategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis. Compared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy and forgetting rate. Our code is publicly available on the https://github.com/Arvin0313/Mecoin-GFSCIL.git .

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T23:04:12Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### SNOOPI: Supercharged One-step Diffusion Distillation with Proper   Guidance
**Authors**: Viet Nguyen, Anh Aengus Nguyen, Trung Dao, Khoi Nguyen, Cuong Pham, Toan Tran, Anh Tran

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:56:32Z

**Summary**: Recent approaches have yielded promising results in distilling multi-step text-to-image diffusion models into one-step ones. The state-of-the-art efficient distillation technique, i.e., SwiftBrushv2 (SBv2), even surpasses the teacher model's performance with limited resources. However, our study reveals its instability when handling different diffusion model backbones due to using a fixed guidance scale within the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) loss. Another weakness of the existing one-step diffusion models is the missing support for negative prompt guidance, which is crucial in practical image generation. This paper presents SNOOPI, a novel framework designed to address these limitations by enhancing the guidance in one-step diffusion models during both training and inference. First, we effectively enhance training stability through Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB), which employs a random-scale classifier-free guidance approach. By varying the guidance scale of both teacher models, we broaden their output distributions, resulting in a more robust VSD loss that enables SB to perform effectively across diverse backbones while maintaining competitive performance. Second, we propose a training-free method called Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA), which integrates negative prompts into one-step diffusion models via cross-attention to suppress undesired elements in generated images. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods significantly improve baseline models across various metrics. Remarkably, we achieve an HPSv2 score of 31.08, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for one-step diffusion models.

### T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization
**Authors**: Wenxuan Zhou, Shujian Zhang, Lingxiao Zhao, Tao Meng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:56:07Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.

### AniGS: Animatable Gaussian Avatar from a Single Image with Inconsistent   Gaussian Reconstruction
**Authors**: Lingteng Qiu, Shenhao Zhu, Qi Zuo, Xiaodong Gu, Yuan Dong, Junfei Zhang, Chao Xu, Zhe Li, Weihao Yuan, Liefeng Bo, Guanying Chen, Zilong Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:55:39Z

**Summary**: Generating animatable human avatars from a single image is essential for various digital human modeling applications. Existing 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to capture fine details in animatable models, while generative approaches for controllable animation, though avoiding explicit 3D modeling, suffer from viewpoint inconsistencies in extreme poses and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging the power of generative models to produce detailed multi-view canonical pose images, which help resolve ambiguities in animatable human reconstruction. We then propose a robust method for 3D reconstruction of inconsistent images, enabling real-time rendering during inference. Specifically, we adapt a transformer-based video generation model to generate multi-view canonical pose images and normal maps, pretraining on a large-scale video dataset to improve generalization. To handle view inconsistencies, we recast the reconstruction problem as a 4D task and introduce an efficient 3D modeling approach using 4D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves photorealistic, real-time animation of 3D human avatars from in-the-wild images, showcasing its effectiveness and generalization capability.

### From Isolated Conversations to Hierarchical Schemas: Dynamic Tree Memory   Representation for LLMs
**Authors**: Alireza Rezazadeh, Zichao Li, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:48:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.

### Mind the Gap: Examining the Self-Improvement Capabilities of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yuda Song, Hanlin Zhang, Carson Eisenach, Sham Kakade, Dean Foster, Udaya Ghai

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:47:26Z

**Summary**: Self-improvement is a mechanism in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, post-training and test-time inference. We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries.

### LLM-Enhanced Path Planning: Safe and Efficient Autonomous Navigation   with Instructional Inputs
**Authors**: Pranav Doma, Aliasghar Arab, Xuesu Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:29:37Z

**Summary**: Autonomous navigation guided by natural language instructions is essential for improving human-robot interaction and enabling complex operations in dynamic environments. While large language models (LLMs) are not inherently designed for planning, they can significantly enhance planning efficiency by providing guidance and informing constraints to ensure safety. This paper introduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid maps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task execution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and real-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans for pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization, and adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address environmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless human-robot interaction. Our results demonstrates the potential of LLMs to design context-aware system to enhance navigation efficiency and safety in industrial and dynamic environments.

### Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational   Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods
**Authors**: Qian Hu, John Veitch

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:24:56Z

**Summary**: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require billions to quadrillions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to millions of core hours. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.

**Summary**: In this work we explore utilizing LLMs for data augmentation for manufacturing task guidance system. The dataset consists of representative samples of interactions with technicians working in an advanced manufacturing setting. The purpose of this work to explore the task, data augmentation for the supported tasks and evaluating the performance of the existing LLMs. We observe that that task is complex requiring understanding from procedure specification documents, actions and objects sequenced temporally. The dataset consists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs that refer to the spec document and are grounded in narrations and/or video demonstrations. We compared the performance of several popular open-sourced LLMs by developing a baseline using each LLM and then compared the responses in a reference-free setting using LLM-as-a-judge and compared the ratings with crowd-workers whilst validating the ratings with experts.

### Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs
**Authors**: Yerram Varun, Rahul Madhavan, Sravanti Addepalli, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:54:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.

### High-z stellar masses can be recovered robustly with JWST photometry
**Authors**: R. K. Cochrane, H. Katz, R. Begley, C. C. Hayward, P. N. Best

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:50:49Z

**Summary**: Robust inference of galaxy stellar masses from photometry is crucial for constraints on galaxy assembly across cosmic time. Here, we test a commonly-used Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code, using simulated galaxies from the SPHINX20 cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, with JWST NIRCam photometry forward-modelled with radiative transfer. Fitting the synthetic photometry with various star formation history models, we show that recovered stellar masses are, encouragingly, generally robust to within a factor of ~3 for galaxies in the range M*~10^7-10^9M_sol at z=5-10. These results are in stark contrast to recent work claiming that stellar masses can be underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude in these mass and redshift ranges. However, while >90% of masses are recovered to within 0.5dex, there are notable systematic trends, with stellar masses typically overestimated for low-mass galaxies (M*<~10^8M_sol) and slightly underestimated for high-mass galaxies (M*>~10^9M_sol). We demonstrate that these trends arise due to the SED fitting code poorly modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry. These systematic trends, which exist for all star formation history parametrisations tested, have a tilting effect on the inferred stellar mass function, with number densities of massive galaxies underestimated (particularly at the lowest redshifts studied) and number densities of lower-mass galaxies typically overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that we should be optimistic about our ability to infer the masses of high-z galaxies observed with JWST (notwithstanding contamination from AGN) but careful when modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry.

### Leveraging LLM for Automated Ontology Extraction and Knowledge Graph   Generation
**Authors**: Mohammad Sadeq Abolhasani, Rong Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:49:02Z

**Summary**: Extracting relevant and structured knowledge from large, complex technical documents within the Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) domain is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our work addresses this challenge by presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.

**Authors**: Kaixiong Gong, Kaituo Feng, Bohao Li, Yibing Wang, Mofan Cheng, Shijia Yang, Jiaming Han, Benyou Wang, Yutong Bai, Zhuoran Yang, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:41:23Z

**Summary**: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Reka Core, have expanded their capabilities to include vision and audio modalities. While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information. This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components. To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs. To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment. We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations. By revealing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide useful insight for future dataset collection and model development.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:38:54Z

**Summary**: LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, a algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions.

### Interpretable Company Similarity with Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Marco Molinari, Vladimir Tregubiak, Victor Shao, Abhimanyu Pandey, Mateusz Mikolajczak, Sebastião Kuznetsov Ryder Torres Pereira

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:34:50Z

**Summary**: Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning hedging, risk management, portfolio diversification, and more. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Clustering embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential technique for determining company similarity, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. In this paper, we explore the use of SAE features in measuring company similarity and benchmark them against (1) SIC codes and (2) Major Group codes. We conclude that SAE features can reproduce and even surpass sector classifications in quantifying fundamental characteristics of companies, evaluated by the correlation of monthly returns, a proxy for similarity, and PnL from cointegration.

### CEGI: Measuring the trade-off between efficiency and carbon emissions   for SLMs and VLMs
**Authors**: Abhas Kumar, Kapil Pathak, Rajesh Kavuru, Prabhakar Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:32:47Z

**Summary**: This paper analyzes the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) and evaluates the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions across 4 essential tasks: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Dialogue Summarization and Text-to-SQL conversion. Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.

### PrefixLLM: LLM-aided Prefix Circuit Design
**Authors**: Weihua Xiao, Venkata Sai Charan Putrevu, Raghu Vamshi Hemadri, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:26:42Z

**Summary**: Prefix circuits are fundamental components in digital adders, widely used in digital systems due to their efficiency in calculating carry signals. Synthesizing prefix circuits with minimized area and delay is crucial for enhancing the performance of modern computing systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a surprising ability to perform text generation tasks. We propose PrefixLLM, that leverages LLMs for prefix circuit synthesis. PrefixLLM transforms the prefix circuit synthesis task into a structured text generation problem, termed the Structured Prefix Circuit Representation (SPCR), and introduces an iterative framework to automatically and accurately generate valid SPCRs. We further present a design space exploration (DSE) framework that uses LLMs to iteratively search for area and delay optimized prefix circuits. Compared to state-of-the-art, PrefixLLM can reduce the area by 3.70% under the same delay constraint. This work highlights the use of LLMs in the synthesis of arithmetic circuits, which can be transformed into the structured text generation.

### OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Junyuan Zhang, Qintong Zhang, Bin Wang, Linke Ouyang, Zichen Wen, Ying Li, Ka-Ho Chow, Conghui He, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:23:47Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 350 carefully selected unstructured PDF documents from six real-world RAG application domains, along with Q&As derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of employing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without OCR in RAG systems. Code: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench

### Bayesian calibration of bubble size dynamics applied to CO2 gas   fermenters
**Authors**: Malik Hassanaly, John M. Parra-Alvarez, Mohammad J. Rahimi, Hariswaran Sitaraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:17:45Z

**Summary**: To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. However, the applicability of existing models beyond air-water mixtures remains to be established. Here, an inverse modeling approach, accelerated with a neural network surrogate, calibrates the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in class methods for population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration is performed based on experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. To accurately capture gas holdup and interphase mass transfer, the results show that the breakage rate needs to be increased by one order of magnitude. The inferred model parameters are then used on a separate configuration and shown to also improve bubble size distribution predictions.

### Explainable CTR Prediction via LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Xiaohan Yu, Li Zhang, Chong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:17:27Z

**Summary**: Recommendation Systems have become integral to modern user experiences, but lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Existing explainable recommendation methods are hindered by reliance on a post-hoc paradigm, wherein explanation generators are trained independently of the underlying recommender models. This paradigm necessitates substantial human effort in data construction and raises concerns about explanation reliability. In this paper, we present ExpCTR, a novel framework that integrates large language model based explanation generation directly into the CTR prediction process. Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning, we employ two carefully designed reward mechanisms, LC alignment, which ensures explanations reflect user intentions, and IC alignment, which maintains consistency with traditional ID-based CTR models. Our approach incorporates an efficient training paradigm with LoRA and a three-stage iterative process. ExpCTR circumvents the need for extensive explanation datasets while fostering synergy between CTR prediction and explanation generation. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpCTR significantly enhances both recommendation accuracy and interpretability across three real-world datasets.

### Copy-Move Forgery Detection and Question Answering for Remote Sensing   Image
**Authors**: Ze Zhang, Enyuan Zhao, Ziyi Wan, Jie Nie, Xinyue Liang, Lei Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:02:40Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces the task of Remote Sensing Copy-Move Question Answering (RSCMQA). Unlike traditional Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA), RSCMQA focuses on interpreting complex tampering scenarios and inferring relationships between objects. Based on the practical needs of national defense security and land resource monitoring, we have developed an accurate and comprehensive global dataset for remote sensing image copy-move question answering, named RS-CMQA-2.1M. These images were collected from 29 different regions across 14 countries. Additionally, we have refined a balanced dataset, RS-CMQA-B, to address the long-standing issue of long-tail data in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose a region-discriminative guided multimodal CMQA model, which enhances the accuracy of answering questions about tampered images by leveraging prompt about the differences and connections between the source and tampered domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides a stronger benchmark for RS-CMQA compared to general VQA and RSVQA models. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/shenyedepisa/RSCMQA.

**Authors**: Siyao Liu, He Zhu, Jerry Liu, Shulin Xin, Aoyan Li, Rui Long, Li Chen, Jack Yang, Jinxiang Xia, Z. Y. Peng, Shukai Liu, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Jing Mai, Ge Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Kai Shen, Liang Xiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:55:24Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.

### SJTU:Spatial judgments in multimodal models towards unified segmentation   through coordinate detection
**Authors**: Joongwon Chae, Zhenyu Wang, Peiwu Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:53:58Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in vision-language understanding, implementing image segmentation within multimodal architectures remains a fundamental challenge in modern artificial intelligence systems. Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in multimodal models - Towards Unified segmentation through coordinate detection, a novel framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework proposes a novel approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models based on multimodal spatial inference. By leveraging normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and translating it into actionable segmentation outputs, we explore the possibility of integrating multimodal spatial and language representations. Based on the proposed technical approach, the framework demonstrates superior performance on various benchmark datasets as well as accurate object segmentation. Results on the COCO 2017 dataset for general object detection and Pascal VOC datasets for semantic segmentation demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the framework.

### Semantic Tokens in Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Joel Suro

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:52:06Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures have recently garnered significant attention for their ability to improve truth grounding and coherence in natural language processing tasks. However, the reliability of RAG systems in producing accurate answers diminishes as the volume of data they access increases. Even with smaller datasets, these systems occasionally fail to address simple queries. This issue arises from their dependence on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which can introduce uncertainty into the system's outputs. In this work, I propose a novel Comparative RAG system that introduces an evaluator module to bridge the gap between probabilistic RAG systems and deterministically verifiable responses. The evaluator compares external recommendations with the retrieved document chunks, adding a decision-making layer that enhances the system's reliability. This approach ensures that the chunks retrieved are both semantically relevant and logically consistent with deterministic insights, thereby improving the accuracy and overall efficiency of RAG systems. This framework paves the way for more reliable and scalable question-answering applications in domains requiring high precision and verifiability.

### Patent-CR: A Dataset for Patent Claim Revision
**Authors**: Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:43:42Z

**Summary**: This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.

**Authors**: Zehan Qi, Xiao Liu, Iat Long Iong, Hanyu Lai, Xueqiao Sun, Wenyi Zhao, Yu Yang, Xinyue Yang, Jiadai Sun, Shuntian Yao, Tianjie Zhang, Wei Xu, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:37:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous agents, particularly in web-based tasks. However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.

### Automatic State Machine Inference for Binary Protocol Reverse   Engineering
**Authors**: Junhai Yang, Fenghua Li, Yixuan Zhang, Junhao Zhang, Liang Fang, Yunchuan Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:33:17Z

**Summary**: Protocol Reverse Engineering (PRE) is used to analyze protocols by inferring their structure and behavior. However, current PRE methods mainly focus on field identification within a single protocol and neglect Protocol State Machine (PSM) analysis in mixed protocol environments. This results in insufficient analysis of protocols' abnormal behavior and potential vulnerabilities, which are crucial for detecting and defending against new attack patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an automatic PSM inference framework for unknown protocols, including a fuzzy membership-based auto-converging DBSCAN algorithm for protocol format clustering, followed by a session clustering algorithm based on Needleman-Wunsch and K-Medoids algorithms to classify sessions by protocol type. Finally, we refine a probabilistic PSM algorithm to infer protocol states and the transition conditions between these states. Experimental results show that, compared with existing PRE techniques, our method can infer PSMs while enabling more precise classification of protocols.

### LLMForecaster: Improving Seasonal Event Forecasts with Unstructured   Textual Data
**Authors**: Hanyu Zhang, Chuck Arvin, Dmitry Efimov, Michael W. Mahoney, Dominique Perrault-Joncas, Shankar Ramasubramanian, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Malcolm Wolff

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:18:42Z

**Summary**: Modern time-series forecasting models often fail to make full use of rich unstructured information about the time series themselves. This lack of proper conditioning can lead to obvious model failures; for example, models may be unaware of the details of a particular product, and hence fail to anticipate seasonal surges in customer demand in the lead up to major exogenous events like holidays for clearly relevant products. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces a novel forecast post-processor -- which we call LLMForecaster -- that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) to incorporate unstructured semantic and contextual information and historical data to improve the forecasts from an existing demand forecasting pipeline. In an industry-scale retail application, we demonstrate that our technique yields statistically significantly forecast improvements across several sets of products subject to holiday-driven demand surges.

### The PRISM Alignment Dataset: What Participatory, Representative and   Individualised Human Feedback Reveals About the Subjective and Multicultural   Alignment of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hannah Rose Kirk, Alexander Whitefield, Paul Röttger, Andrew Bean, Katerina Margatina, Juan Ciro, Rafael Mosquera, Max Bartolo, Adina Williams, He He, Bertie Vidgen, Scott A. Hale

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:18:10Z

**Summary**: Human feedback is central to the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, open questions remain about methods (how), domains (where), people (who) and objectives (to what end) of feedback processes. To navigate these questions, we introduce PRISM, a dataset that maps the sociodemographics and stated preferences of 1,500 diverse participants from 75 countries, to their contextual preferences and fine-grained feedback in 8,011 live conversations with 21 LLMs. With PRISM, we contribute (i) wider geographic and demographic participation in feedback; (ii) census-representative samples for two countries (UK, US); and (iii) individualised ratings that link to detailed participant profiles, permitting personalisation and attribution of sample artefacts. We target subjective and multicultural perspectives on value-laden and controversial issues, where we expect interpersonal and cross-cultural disagreement. We use PRISM in three case studies to demonstrate the need for careful consideration of which humans provide what alignment data.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:12:09Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### EVOR: Evolving Retrieval for Code Generation
**Authors**: Hongjin Su, Shuyang Jiang, Yuhang Lai, Haoyuan Wu, Boao Shi, Che Liu, Qian Liu, Tao Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T15:56:26Z

**Summary**: Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been successfully applied in code generation. However, existing pipelines for retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) employ static knowledge bases with a single source, limiting the adaptation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to domains they have insufficient knowledge of. In this work, we develop a novel pipeline, EVOR, that employs the synchronous evolution of both queries and diverse knowledge bases. On two realistic settings where the external knowledge is required to solve code generation tasks, we compile four new datasets associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages, named EVOR-BENCH. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOR achieves two to four times of execution accuracy compared to other methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024), DocPrompting (Zhou et al., 2023), etc. We demonstrate that EVOR is flexible and can be easily combined with them to achieve further improvement. Further analysis reveals that EVOR benefits from the synchronous evolution of queries and documents and the diverse information sources in the knowledge base. We hope that our studies will inspire more insights into the design of advanced RACG pipelines in future research. Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.

### Exploring the hierarchical structure of human plans via program   generation
**Authors**: Carlos G. Correa, Sophia Sanborn, Mark K. Ho, Frederick Callaway, Nathaniel D. Daw, Thomas L. Griffiths

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T15:22:38Z

**Summary**: Human behavior is often assumed to be hierarchically structured, made up of abstract actions that can be decomposed into concrete actions. However, behavior is typically measured as a sequence of actions, which makes it difficult to infer its hierarchical structure. In this paper, we explore how people form hierarchically structured plans, using an experimental paradigm with observable hierarchical representations: participants create programs that produce sequences of actions in a language with explicit hierarchical structure. This task lets us test two well-established principles of human behavior: utility maximization (i.e. using fewer actions) and minimum description length (MDL; i.e. having a shorter program). We find that humans are sensitive to both metrics, but that both accounts fail to predict a qualitative feature of human-created programs, namely that people prefer programs with reuse over and above the predictions of MDL. We formalize this preference for reuse by extending the MDL account into a generative model over programs, modeling hierarchy choice as the induction of a grammar over actions. Our account can explain the preference for reuse and provides better predictions of human behavior, going beyond simple accounts of compressibility to highlight a principle that guides hierarchical planning.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:45:03Z

**Summary**: Spatial confounding poses a significant challenge in scientific studies involving spatial data, where unobserved spatial variables can influence both treatment and outcome, possibly leading to spurious associations. To address this problem, we introduce SpaCE: The Spatial Confounding Environment, the first toolkit to provide realistic benchmark datasets and tools for systematically evaluating causal inference methods designed to alleviate spatial confounding. Each dataset includes training data, true counterfactuals, a spatial graph with coordinates, and smoothness and confounding scores characterizing the effect of a missing spatial confounder. It also includes realistic semi-synthetic outcomes and counterfactuals, generated using state-of-the-art machine learning ensembles, following best practices for causal inference benchmarks. The datasets cover real treatment and covariates from diverse domains, including climate, health and social sciences. SpaCE facilitates an automated end-to-end pipeline, simplifying data loading, experimental setup, and evaluating machine learning and causal inference models. The SpaCE project provides several dozens of datasets of diverse sizes and spatial complexity. It is publicly available as a Python package, encouraging community feedback and contributions.

### A Probabilistic Perspective on Unlearning and Alignment for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yan Scholten, Stephan Günnemann, Leo Schwinn

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:31:41Z

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an open research problem. Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated via greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to capture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate estimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical contexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are crucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation framework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability guarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are application-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates about model capabilities before deployment. Through a case study focused on unlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate successful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that most if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in these models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy optimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves unlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks. Our proposed shift from point estimates to probabilistic evaluations of output distributions represents an important step toward comprehensive evaluations of LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/yascho/probabilistic-unlearning.

### BayLing 2: A Multilingual Large Language Model with Efficient Language   Alignment
**Authors**: Shaolei Zhang, Kehao Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Yan Zhou, Xiaodong Liu, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:17:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and vast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these abilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively limited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore crucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive approach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct instruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for over 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing 2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions, comprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and cross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning based on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages. Using Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B, and BayLing-2-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For multilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior performance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual knowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant improvements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its capability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing maintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the performance in low-resource languages. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.

### DP-2Stage: Adapting Language Models as Differentially Private Tabular   Data Generators
**Authors**: Tejumade Afonja, Hui-Po Wang, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:10:09Z

**Summary**: Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose \ours, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.

### Gracefully Filtering Backdoor Samples for Generative Large Language   Models without Retraining
**Authors**: Zongru Wu, Pengzhou Cheng, Lingyong Fang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T13:43:36Z

**Summary**: Backdoor attacks remain significant security threats to generative large language models (LLMs). Since generative LLMs output sequences of high-dimensional token logits instead of low-dimensional classification logits, most existing backdoor defense methods designed for discriminative models like BERT are ineffective for generative LLMs. Inspired by the observed differences in learning behavior between backdoor and clean mapping in the frequency space, we transform gradients of each training sample, directly influencing parameter updates, into the frequency space. Our findings reveal a distinct separation between the gradients of backdoor and clean samples in the frequency space. Based on this phenomenon, we propose Gradient Clustering in the Frequency Space for Backdoor Sample Filtering (GraCeFul), which leverages sample-wise gradients in the frequency space to effectively identify backdoor samples without requiring retraining LLMs. Experimental results show that GraCeFul outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, GraCeFul exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, achieving nearly 100% recall and F1 scores in identifying backdoor samples, reducing the average success rate of various backdoor attacks to 0% with negligible drops in clean accuracy across multiple free-style question answering datasets. Additionally, GraCeFul generalizes to Llama-2 and Vicuna. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GraceFul.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T13:25:18Z

**Summary**: Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) seeks to transcend the limitations of both Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and narrow AI by integrating domain-specific expertise with critical, precise reasoning capabilities akin to those of top human experts. Existing AI systems often excel at predefined tasks but struggle with adaptability and precision in novel problem-solving. To overcome this, AEI introduces a framework for ``Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Reasoning". This paradigm provides robust theoretical guarantees for reliably decomposing complex problems, with a practical mechanism for controlling reasoning precision. In reference to the division of human thought into System 1 for intuitive thinking and System 2 for reflective reasoning~\citep{tversky1974judgment}, we refer to this new type of reasoning as System 3 for precise reasoning, inspired by the rigor of the scientific method. AEI thus establishes a foundation for error-bounded, inference-time learning.

### Nature versus nurture in galaxy formation: the effect of environment on   star formation with causal machine learning
**Authors**: Sunil Mucesh, William G. Hartley, Ciarán M. Gilligan-Lee, Ofer Lahav

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T13:21:09Z

**Summary**: Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is at the heart of modern astronomy. With the advent of large-scale surveys and simulations, remarkable progress has been made in the last few decades. Despite this, the physical processes behind the phenomena, and particularly their importance, remain far from known, as correlations have primarily been established rather than the underlying causality. We address this challenge by applying the causal inference framework. Specifically, we tackle the fundamental open question of whether galaxy formation and evolution depends more on nature (i.e., internal processes) or nurture (i.e., external processes), by estimating the causal effect of environment on star-formation rate in the IllustrisTNG simulations. To do so, we develop a comprehensive causal model and employ cutting-edge techniques from epidemiology to overcome the long-standing problem of disentangling nature and nurture. We find that the causal effect is negative and substantial, with environment suppressing the SFR by a maximal factor of $\sim100$. While the overall effect at $z=0$ is negative, in the early universe, environment is discovered to have a positive impact, boosting star formation by a factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim1$ and by even greater amounts at higher redshifts. Furthermore, we show that: (i) nature also plays an important role, as ignoring it underestimates the causal effect in intermediate-density environments by a factor of $\sim2$, (ii) controlling for the stellar mass at a snapshot in time, as is common in the literature, is not only insufficient to disentangle nature and nurture but actually has an adverse effect, though (iii) stellar mass is an adequate proxy of the effects of nature. Finally, this work may prove a useful blueprint for extracting causal insights in other fields that deal with dynamical systems with closed feedback loops, such as the Earth's climate.

### Reproduction of AdEx dynamics on neuromorphic hardware through data   embedding and simulation-based inference
**Authors**: Jakob Huhle, Jakob Kaiser, Eric Müller, Johannes Schemmel

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T13:19:21Z

**Summary**: The development of mechanistic models of physical systems is essential for understanding their behavior and formulating predictions that can be validated experimentally. Calibration of these models, especially for complex systems, requires automated optimization methods due to the impracticality of manual parameter tuning. In this study, we use an autoencoder to automatically extract relevant features from the membrane trace of a complex neuron model emulated on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system, and subsequently leverage sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), a simulation-based inference algorithm, to approximate the posterior distribution of neuron parameters. Our results demonstrate that the autoencoder is able to extract essential features from the observed membrane traces, with which the SNPE algorithm is able to find an approximation of the posterior distribution. This suggests that the combination of an autoencoder with the SNPE algorithm is a promising optimization method for complex systems.

### GerPS-Compare: Comparing NER methods for legal norm analysis
**Authors**: Sarah T. Bachinger, Christoph Unger, Robin Erd, Leila Feddoul, Clara Lachenmaier, Sina Zarrieß, Birgitta König-Ries

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:46:06Z

**Summary**: We apply NER to a particular sub-genre of legal texts in German: the genre of legal norms regulating administrative processes in public service administration. The analysis of such texts involves identifying stretches of text that instantiate one of ten classes identified by public service administration professionals. We investigate and compare three methods for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect these classes: a Rule-based system, deep discriminative models, and a deep generative model. Our results show that Deep Discriminative models outperform both the Rule-based system as well as the Deep Generative model, the latter two roughly performing equally well, outperforming each other in different classes. The main cause for this somewhat surprising result is arguably the fact that the classes used in the analysis are semantically and syntactically heterogeneous, in contrast to the classes used in more standard NER tasks. Deep Discriminative models appear to be better equipped for dealing with this heterogenerity than both generic LLMs and human linguists designing rule-based NER systems.

### A Multi-Agent Framework for Extensible Structured Text Generation in   PLCs
**Authors**: Donghao Yang, Aolang Wu, Tianyi Zhang, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Xiaoli Lian, Yuming Ren, Jiaji Tian

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:05:56Z

**Summary**: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are microcomputers essential for automating factory operations. Structured Text (ST), a high-level language adhering to the IEC 61131-3 standard, is pivotal for PLCs due to its ability to express logic succinctly and to seamlessly integrate with other languages within the same standard. However, vendors develop their own customized versions of ST, and the lack of comprehensive and standardized documentation for the full semantics of ST has contributed to inconsistencies in how the language is implemented. Consequently, the steep learning curve associated with ST, combined with ever-evolving industrial requirements, presents significant challenges for developers. In response to these issues, we present AutoPLC, an LLM-based approach designed to automate the generation of vendor-specific ST code. To facilitate effective code generation, we first built a comprehensive knowledge base, including Rq2ST Case Library (requirements and corresponding implementations) and Instruction libraries. Then we developed a retrieval module to incorporate the domain-specific knowledge by identifying pertinent cases and instructions, guiding the LLM to generate code that meets the requirements. In order to verify and improve the quality of the generated code, we designed an adaptable code checker. If errors are detected, we initiate an iterative self-improvement process to instruct the LLM to revise the generated code. We evaluate AutoPLC's performance against seven state-of-the-art baselines using three benchmarks, one for open-source basic ST and two for commercial Structured Control Language (SCL) from Siemens. The results show that our approach consistently achieves superior performance across all benchmarks. Ablation study emphasizes the significance of our modules. Further manual analysis confirm the practical utility of the ST code generated by AutoPLC.

### Simulation-based inference of black hole ringdowns in the time domain
**Authors**: Costantino Pacilio, Swetha Bhagwat, Roberto Cotesta

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T11:03:28Z

**Summary**: Gravitational waves emitted by a ringing black hole allow us to perform precision tests of general relativity in the strong field regime. With improvements to our current gravitational wave detectors and upcoming next-generation detectors, developing likelihood-free parameter inference infrastructure is critical as we will face complications like nonstandard noise properties, partial data and incomplete signal modeling that may not allow for an analytically tractable likelihood function. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept strategy to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference on ringdown gravitational waves using simulation based inference. Specifically, our method is based on truncated sequential neural posterior estimation, which trains a neural density estimator of the posterior for a specific observed data segment. We setup the ringdown parameter estimation directly in the time domain. We show that the parameter estimation results obtained using our trained networks are in agreement with well-established Markov-chain methods for simulated injections as well as analysis on real detector data corresponding to GW150914. Additionally, to assess our approach's internal consistency, we show that the density estimators pass a Bayesian coverage test.

### HERO: Hint-Based Efficient and Reliable Query Optimizer
**Authors**: Sergey Zinchenko, Sergey Iazov

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:58:34Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel model for learned query optimization which provides query hints leading to better execution plans. The model addresses the three key challenges in learned hint-based query optimization: reliable hint recommendation (ensuring non-degradation of query latency), efficient hint exploration, and fast inference. We provide an in-depth analysis of existing NN-based approaches to hint-based optimization and experimentally confirm the named challenges for them. Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints. Controlling the degree of parallelism (query dop) in addition to operator-related hints enables our model to achieve 3x latency improvement on JOB benchmark which sets a new standard for optimization. Our model is interpretable and easy to debug, which is particularly important for deployment in production.

### ScImage: How Good Are Multimodal Large Language Models at Scientific   Text-to-Image Generation?
**Authors**: Leixin Zhang, Steffen Eger, Yinjie Cheng, Weihe Zhai, Jonas Belouadi, Christoph Leiter, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Fahimeh Moafian, Zhixue Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:52:06Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual instructions. However, their performance in generating scientific images--a critical application for accelerating scientific progress--remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing ScImage, a benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific images from textual descriptions. ScImage assesses three key dimensions of understanding: spatial, numeric, and attribute comprehension, as well as their combinations, focusing on the relationships between scientific objects (e.g., squares, circles). We evaluate five models, GPT-4o, Llama, AutomaTikZ, Dall-E, and StableDiffusion, using two modes of output generation: code-based outputs (Python, TikZ) and direct raster image generation. Additionally, we examine four different input languages: English, German, Farsi, and Chinese. Our evaluation, conducted with 11 scientists across three criteria (correctness, relevance, and scientific accuracy), reveals that while GPT-4o produces outputs of decent quality for simpler prompts involving individual dimensions such as spatial, numeric, or attribute understanding in isolation, all models face challenges in this task, especially for more complex prompts.

### Evolution of the UV slope of galaxies at cosmic morning (z > 4): the   properties of extremely blue galaxies

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:47:39Z

**Summary**: We present an analysis of the UV continuum slope, beta, using a sample of 733 galaxies selected from a mixture of JWST ERS/GTO/GO observational programs and with z > 4. We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution PRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV we find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34), consistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous works. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at high redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope. Furthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as beta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous results that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select a sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta < -2.6): such slopes are steeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free, young, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is included. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the possible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample of redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have younger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust attenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to red galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta values. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most recent models, we estimate escape fractions f_esc > 10% in at least 25% of XBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f_esc. A reduced nebular continuum contribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty star-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.

### Realistic Surgical Simulation from Monocular Videos
**Authors**: Kailing Wang, Chen Yang, Keyang Zhao, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:32:41Z

**Summary**: This paper tackles the challenge of automatically performing realistic surgical simulations from readily available surgical videos. Recent efforts have successfully integrated physically grounded dynamics within 3D Gaussians to perform high-fidelity simulations in well-reconstructed simulation environments from static scenes. However, they struggle with the geometric inconsistency in reconstructing simulation environments and unrealistic physical deformations in simulations of soft tissues when it comes to dynamic and complex surgical processes. In this paper, we propose SurgiSim, a novel automatic simulation system to overcome these limitations. To build a surgical simulation environment, we maintain a canonical 3D scene composed of 3D Gaussians coupled with a deformation field to represent a dynamic surgical scene. This process involves a multi-stage optimization with trajectory and anisotropic regularization, enhancing the geometry consistency of the canonical scene, which serves as the simulation environment. To achieve realistic physical simulations in this environment, we implement a Visco-Elastic deformation model based on the Maxwell model, effectively restoring the complex deformations of tissues. Additionally, we infer the physical parameters of tissues by minimizing the discrepancies between the input video and simulation results guided by estimated tissue motion, ensuring realistic simulation outcomes. Experiments on various surgical scenarios and interactions demonstrate SurgiSim's ability to perform realistic simulation of soft tissues among surgical procedures, showing its enormous potential for enhancing surgical training, planning, and robotic surgery systems.

### UniForm: A Reuse Attention Mechanism Optimized for Efficient Vision   Transformers on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Seul-Ki Yeom, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:04:15Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, but their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reuse Attention mechanism, tailored for efficient memory access and computational optimization, enabling seamless operation on resource-constrained platforms without compromising performance. Unlike traditional multi-head attention (MHA), which redundantly computes separate attention matrices for each head, Reuse Attention consolidates these computations into a shared attention matrix, significantly reducing memory overhead and computational complexity. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and downstream tasks show that the proposed UniForm models leveraging Reuse Attention achieve state-of-the-art imagenet classification accuracy while outperforming existing attention mechanisms, such as Linear Attention and Flash Attention, in inference speed and memory scalability. Notably, UniForm-l achieves a 76.7% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 21.8ms inference time on edge devices like the Jetson AGX Orin, representing up to a 5x speedup over competing benchmark methods. These results demonstrate the versatility of Reuse Attention across high-performance GPUs and edge platforms, paving the way for broader real-time applications

### Cosmic primordial density fluctuations and Bell inequalities
**Authors**: Roberto Dale, Ramon Lapiedra, Juan Antonio Morales-Lladosa

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:55:18Z

**Summary**: The temperature measurements, $T$, of the perturbed cosmic microwave background, performed by the cosmic background explorer satellite (COBE), are considered. A dichotomist function, $f = \pm 1$, is defined such that $f =+1$ if $\delta T > 0$ and $f =-1$ if $\delta T < 0$, where $\delta T$ stands for the fluctuation of $T$. Then, it is assumed that behind the appearance of these fluctuations there is local realism. Under this assumption, some specific Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequalities are proved for these fluctuation temperatures measured by COBE in the different sky directions. The calculation of these inequalities from the actual temperature measurements shows that these inequalities are not violated. This result cannot be anticipated by calculating the commutators of the cosmic density quantum operators. This must be remarked here since, in the case of a system of two entangled spin ${\textstyle{1 \over 2}}$ particles, its CHSH inequalities violation can be inferred from the nonvanishing value of the corresponding spin measurement commutators. The above nonviolation of the observed cosmic CHSH inequalities is compatible with the existence of local realism behind the cosmic measurement results. Nevertheless, assuming again local realism, some new cosmic CHSH inequalities can be derived for the case of the WMAP measurements whose accuracy is better than the one of the above considered COBE measurements. More specifically, in the WMAP case, some significant cross correlations between the temperature and polarization maps are detected, and the new cosmic CHSH inequalities are the ones built with these cross correlations. Now, the occasional violation of these CHSH inequalities would mean the failure of the assumed local realism in accordance with the quantum origin of the primordial temperature and polarization fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation.

### Morescient GAI for Software Engineering (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Marcus Kessel, Colin Atkinson

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:51:23Z

**Summary**: The ability of Generative AI (GAI) technology to automatically check, synthesize and modify software engineering artifacts promises to revolutionize all aspects of software engineering. Using GAI for software engineering tasks is consequently one of the most rapidly expanding fields of software engineering research, with over a hundred LLM-based code models having been published since 2021. However, the overwhelming majority of existing code models share a major weakness - they are exclusively trained on the syntactic facet of software, significantly lowering their trustworthiness in tasks dependent on software semantics. To address this problem, a new class of "Morescient" GAI is needed that is "aware" of (i.e., trained on) both the semantic and static facets of software. This, in turn, will require a new generation of software observation platforms capable of generating large quantities of execution observations in a structured and readily analyzable way. In this paper, we present a vision and roadmap for how such "Morescient" GAI models can be engineered, evolved and disseminated according to the principles of open science.

**Authors**: Buntaro Hiraki, Kensei Hamamoto, Ami Kimura, Masateru Tsunoda, Amjed Tahir, Kwabena Ebo Bennin, Akito Monden, Keitaro Nakasai

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:43:55Z

**Summary**: Code readability is an important indicator of software maintenance as it can significantly impact maintenance efforts. Recently, LLM (large language models) have been utilized for code readability evaluation. However, readability evaluation differs among developers, so personalization of the evaluation by LLM is needed. This study proposes a method which calibrates the evaluation, using collaborative filtering. Our preliminary analysis suggested that the method effectively enhances the accuracy of the readability evaluation using LLMs.

### The Logic of Counterfactuals and the Epistemology of Causal Inference
**Authors**: Hanti Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:41:22Z

**Summary**: The 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics recognizes a type of causal model known as the Rubin causal model, or potential outcome framework, which deserves far more attention from philosophers than it currently receives. To spark philosophers' interest, I develop a dialectic connecting the Rubin causal model to the Lewis-Stalnaker debate on a logical principle of counterfactuals: Conditional Excluded Middle (CEM). I begin by playing good cop for CEM, developing a new argument in its favor -- a Quine-Putnam-style indispensability argument. This argument is based on the observation that CEM seems to be indispensable to the Rubin causal model, which underpins our best scientific theory of causal inference in health and social sciences -- a Nobel Prize-winning theory. Indeed, CEM has long remained a core assumption of the Rubin causal model, despite challenges from within the statistics and economics communities over twenty years ago. I then switch sides to play bad cop for CEM, undermining the indispensability argument by developing a new theory of causal inference that dispenses with CEM while preserving the successes of the original theory (thanks to a new theorem proved here). The key, somewhat surprisingly, is to integrate two approaches to causal modeling: the Rubin causal model, more familiar in health and social sciences, and the causal Bayes net, more familiar in philosophy. The good cop/bad cop dialectic is concluded with a connection to broader philosophical issues, including intertheory relations, the revisability of logic, and the role of background assumptions in justifying scientific inference.

### Simulation-based inference has its own Dodelson-Schneider effect (but it   knows that it does)
**Authors**: Jed Homer, Oliver Friedrich, Daniel Gruen

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:28:05Z

**Summary**: Making inferences about physical properties of the Universe requires knowledge of the data likelihood. A Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed for the uncertainties with a covariance matrix estimated from a set of simulations. The noise in such covariance estimates causes two problems: it distorts the width of the parameter contours, and it adds scatter to the location of those contours which is not captured by the widths themselves. For non-Gaussian likelihoods, an approximation may be derived via Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). It is often implicitly assumed that parameter constraints from SBI analyses, which do not use covariance matrices, are not affected by the same problems as parameter estimation with a covariance matrix estimated from simulations. We investigate whether SBI suffers from effects similar to those of covariance estimation in Gaussian likelihoods. We use Neural Posterior and Likelihood Estimation with continuous and masked autoregressive normalizing flows for density estimation. We fit our approximate posterior models to simulations drawn from a Gaussian linear model, so that the SBI result can be compared to the true posterior. We test linear and neural network based compression, demonstrating that neither methods circumvent the issues of covariance estimation. SBI suffers an inflation of posterior variance that is equal or greater than the analytical result in covariance estimation for Gaussian likelihoods for the same number of simulations. The assumption that SBI requires a smaller number of simulations than covariance estimation for a Gaussian likelihood analysis is inaccurate. The limitations of traditional likelihood analysis with simulation-based covariance remain for SBI with a finite simulation budget. Despite these issues, we show that SBI correctly draws the true posterior contour given enough simulations.

### LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation
**Authors**: Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:25:11Z

**Summary**: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

### Partial Non-rigid Deformations and interpolations of Human Body Surfaces
**Authors**: Thomas Besnier, Emery Pierson, Sylvain Arguillere, Mohamed Daoudi

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:21:04Z

**Summary**: Non-rigid shape deformations pose significant challenges, and most existing methods struggle to handle partial deformations effectively. We present Partial Non-rigid Deformations and interpolations of the human body Surfaces (PaNDAS), a new method to learn local and global deformations of 3D surface meshes by building on recent deep models. Unlike previous approaches, our method enables restricting deformations to specific parts of the shape in a versatile way and allows for mixing and combining various poses from the database, all while not requiring any optimization at inference time. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used to generate new shapes, interpolate between parts of shapes, and perform other shape manipulation tasks with state-of-the-art accuracy and greater locality across various types of human surface data. Code and data will be made available soon.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:06:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their adoption is limited by high computational costs during inference. While increasing parameter counts enhances accuracy, it also widens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a framework to accelerate LLM inference on specific hardware while preserving their capabilities. Through an innovative application of neural architecture search (NAS) at an unprecedented scale, Puzzle systematically optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters under hardware constraints. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization.   We demonstrate the real-world impact of our framework through Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while preserving 98.4% of the original model's capabilities. Nemotron-51B currently stands as the most accurate language model capable of inference on a single GPU with large batch sizes. Remarkably, this transformation required just 45B training tokens, compared to over 15T tokens used for the 70B model it was derived from. This establishes a new paradigm where powerful models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible compromise of their capabilities, demonstrating that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection. With the release of Nemotron-51B and the presentation of the Puzzle framework, we provide practitioners immediate access to state-of-the-art language modeling capabilities at significantly reduced computational costs.

### Monocular Lane Detection Based on Deep Learning: A Survey
**Authors**: Xin He, Haiyun Guo, Kuan Zhu, Bingke Zhu, Xu Zhao, Jianwu Fang, Jinqiao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:05:50Z

**Summary**: Lane detection plays an important role in autonomous driving perception systems. As deep learning algorithms gain popularity, monocular lane detection methods based on them have demonstrated superior performance and emerged as a key research direction in autonomous driving perception. The core designs of these algorithmic frameworks can be summarized as follows: (1) Task paradigm, focusing on lane instance-level discrimination; (2) Lane modeling, representing lanes as a set of learnable parameters in the neural network; (3) Global context supplementation, enhancing inference on the obscure lanes; (4) Perspective effect elimination, providing accurate 3D lanes for downstream applications. From these perspectives, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing methods, encompassing both the increasingly mature 2D lane detection approaches and the developing 3D lane detection works. Besides, this paper compares the performance of mainstream methods on different benchmarks and investigates their inference speed under a unified setting for fair comparison. Moreover, we present some extended works on lane detection, including multi-task perception, video lane detection, online high-definition map construction, and lane topology reasoning, to offer readers a comprehensive roadmap for the evolution of lane detection. Finally, we point out some potential future research directions in this field. We exhaustively collect the papers and codes of existing works at https://github.com/Core9724/Awesome-Lane-Detection and will keep tracing the research.

### A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Aspect-Based   Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Changzhi Zhou, Dandan Song, Yuhang Tian, Zhijing Wu, Hao Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Jun Yang, Ziyi Yang, Shuhao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:54:17Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of natural language processing, revolutionizing numerous downstream tasks with powerful reasoning and generation abilities. For example, In-Context Learning (ICL) introduces a fine-tuning-free paradigm, allowing out-of-the-box LLMs to execute downstream tasks by analogy learning without any fine-tuning. Besides, in a fine-tuning-dependent paradigm where substantial training data exists, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), as the cost-effective methods, enable LLMs to achieve excellent performance comparable to full fine-tuning.   However, these fascinating techniques employed by LLMs have not been fully exploited in the ABSA field. Previous works probe LLMs in ABSA by merely using randomly selected input-output pairs as demonstrations in ICL, resulting in an incomplete and superficial evaluation. In this paper, we shed light on a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in the ABSA field, involving 13 datasets, 8 ABSA subtasks, and 6 LLMs. Specifically, we design a unified task formulation to unify ``multiple LLMs for multiple ABSA subtasks in multiple paradigms.'' For the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm, we efficiently fine-tune LLMs using instruction-based multi-task learning. For the fine-tuning-free paradigm, we propose 3 demonstration selection strategies to stimulate the few-shot abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art performance compared to fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) in the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm. More importantly, in the fine-tuning-free paradigm where SLMs are ineffective, LLMs with ICL still showcase impressive potential and even compete with fine-tuned SLMs on some ABSA subtasks.

### Connecting Large Language Models with Blockchain: Advancing the   Evolution of Smart Contracts from Automation to Intelligence
**Authors**: Youquan Xian, Xueying Zeng, Duancheng Xuan, Danping Yang, Chunpei Li, Peng Fan, Peng Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:35:51Z

**Summary**: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.

### Diffusion Implicit Policy for Unpaired Scene-aware Motion Synthesis
**Authors**: Jingyu Gong, Chong Zhang, Fengqi Liu, Ke Fan, Qianyu Zhou, Xin Tan, Zhizhong Zhang, Yuan Xie, Lizhuang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:34:41Z

**Summary**: Human motion generation is a long-standing problem, and scene-aware motion synthesis has been widely researched recently due to its numerous applications. Prevailing methods rely heavily on paired motion-scene data whose quantity is limited. Meanwhile, it is difficult to generalize to diverse scenes when trained only on a few specific ones. Thus, we propose a unified framework, termed Diffusion Implicit Policy (DIP), for scene-aware motion synthesis, where paired motion-scene data are no longer necessary. In this framework, we disentangle human-scene interaction from motion synthesis during training and then introduce an interaction-based implicit policy into motion diffusion during inference. Synthesized motion can be derived through iterative diffusion denoising and implicit policy optimization, thus motion naturalness and interaction plausibility can be maintained simultaneously. The proposed implicit policy optimizes the intermediate noised motion in a GAN Inversion manner to maintain motion continuity and control keyframe poses though the ControlNet branch and motion inpainting. For long-term motion synthesis, we introduce motion blending for stable transitions between multiple sub-tasks, where motions are fused in rotation power space and translation linear space. The proposed method is evaluated on synthesized scenes with ShapeNet furniture, and real scenes from PROX and Replica. Results show that our framework presents better motion naturalness and interaction plausibility than cutting-edge methods. This also indicates the feasibility of utilizing the DIP for motion synthesis in more general tasks and versatile scenes. https://jingyugong.github.io/DiffusionImplicitPolicy/

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:29:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

### Demystifying Language Model Forgetting with Low-rank Example   Associations
**Authors**: Xisen Jin, Xiang Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:03:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) suffer from forgetting of upstream data when fine-tuned. Despite efforts on mitigating forgetting, few have investigated whether, and how forgotten upstream examples are dependent on and associated with newly learned tasks. Insights on such associations enable efficient and targeted mitigation of forgetting. In this paper, we empirically analyze forgetting (measured in log-perplexity increase) that occurs in $N$ upstream examples of language modeling or instruction-tuning after fine-tuning LLMs on one of $M$ new tasks, visualized in $M\times N$ matrices. We demonstrate that the matrices display simple low-rank patterns, often well-approximated with multiplicative scalar effects of upstream examples and newly learned tasks. We also examine fine-grained associations with visualization and statistics. Leveraging the low-rank nature of the associations, we predict forgetting of upstream examples when fine-tuning on unseen tasks with matrix completion over the empirical associations. This enables fast identification of most forgotten examples without expensive inference on the entire upstream data. The approach, despite simplicity, outperforms prior approaches that learn semantic relationships of learned tasks and upstream examples with LMs for predicting forgetting. We demonstrate the practical utility of our analysis by showing statistically significantly reduced forgetting as we upweight predicted examples for replay at fine-tuning.

### Sibyl: Empowering Empathetic Dialogue Generation in Large Language   Models via Sensible and Visionary Commonsense Inference
**Authors**: Lanrui Wang, Jiangnan Li, Chenxu Yang, Zheng Lin, Hongyin Tang, Huan Liu, Yanan Cao, Jingang Wang, Weiping Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:57:33Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a heightened interest in building chatbots based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human-like qualities in multi-turn conversations. Despite having access to commonsense knowledge to better understand the psychological aspects and causality of dialogue context, even these powerful LLMs struggle to achieve the goals of empathy and emotional support. Current commonsense knowledge derived from dialogue contexts is inherently limited and often fails to adequately anticipate the future course of a dialogue. This lack of foresight can mislead LLMs and hinder their ability to provide effective support. In response to this challenge, we present an innovative framework named Sensible and Visionary Commonsense Knowledge (Sibyl). Designed to concentrate on the immediately succeeding dialogue, this paradigm equips LLMs with the capability to uncover the implicit requirements of the conversation, aiming to elicit more empathetic responses. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our paradigm for acquiring commonsense knowledge into LLMs comprehensively enhances the quality of their responses.

### BANER: Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition
**Authors**: Quanjiang Guo, Yihong Dong, Ling Tian, Zhao Kang, Yu Zhang, Sijie Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:51:14Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent success of two-stage prototypical networks in few-shot named entity recognition (NER), challenges such as over/under-detected false spans in the span detection stage and unaligned entity prototypes in the type classification stage persist. Additionally, LLMs have not proven to be effective few-shot information extractors in general. In this paper, we propose an approach called Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition to address these issues. We introduce a boundary-aware contrastive learning strategy to enhance the LLM's ability to perceive entity boundaries for generalized entity spans. Additionally, we utilize LoRAHub to align information from the target domain to the source domain, thereby enhancing adaptive cross-domain classification capabilities. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms prior methods, validating its effectiveness. In particular, the proposed strategies demonstrate effectiveness across a range of LLM architectures. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/BANER.

### Model Editing for LLMs4Code: How Far are We?
**Authors**: Xiaopeng Li, Shangwen Wang, Shasha Li, Jun Ma, Jie Yu, Xiaodong Liu, Jing Wang, Bin Ji, Weimin Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:40:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) have been found to exhibit outstanding performance in the software engineering domain, especially the remarkable performance in coding tasks. However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the performance of the state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs.

### AutoGuide: Automated Generation and Selection of Context-Aware   Guidelines for Large Language Model Agents
**Authors**: Yao Fu, Dong-Ki Kim, Jaekyeom Kim, Sungryull Sohn, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Kyunghoon Bae, Honglak Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:36:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents capable of performing various sequential decision-making tasks. However, effectively guiding LLMs to perform well in unfamiliar domains like web navigation, where they lack sufficient knowledge, has proven to be difficult with the demonstration-based in-context learning paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called AutoGuide, which addresses this limitation by automatically generating context-aware guidelines from offline experiences. Importantly, each context-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows a conditional structure, clearly describing the context where it is applicable. As a result, our guidelines facilitate the provision of relevant knowledge for the agent's current decision-making process, overcoming the limitations of the conventional demonstration-based learning paradigm. Our evaluation demonstrates that AutoGuide significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex benchmark domains, including real-world web navigation.

### Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal   datasets
**Authors**: Toshihiro Hirano, Tsunehiro Ishihara

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:25:55Z

**Summary**: Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.

### Unlocking Tuning-Free Few-Shot Adaptability in Visual Foundation Models   by Recycling Pre-Tuned LoRAs
**Authors**: Zixuan Hu, Yongxian Wei, Li Shen, Chun Yuan, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:25:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate strong few-shot adaptability without requiring fine-tuning, positioning them ideal for data-limited and real-time applications. However, this adaptability has not yet been replicated in current Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which require explicit fine-tuning with sufficient tuning data. Besides, the pretraining-finetuning paradigm has led to the surge of numerous task-specific modular components, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). For the first time, we explore the potential of reusing diverse pre-tuned LoRAs without accessing their original training data, to achieve tuning-free few-shot adaptation in VFMs. Our framework, LoRA Recycle, distills a meta-LoRA from diverse pre-tuned LoRAs with a meta-learning objective, using surrogate data generated inversely from pre-tuned LoRAs themselves. The VFM, once equipped with the meta-LoRA, is empowered to solve new few-shot tasks in a single forward pass, akin to the in-context learning of LLMs. Additionally, we incorporate a double-efficient mechanism tailored to our framework, significantly accelerating the meta-training process while maintaining or even improving performance. Extensive experiments across various few-shot classification benchmarks across both in- and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

### Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop   Resampling
**Authors**: Yuejiang Liu, Jubayer Ibn Hamid, Annie Xie, Yoonho Lee, Maximilian Du, Chelsea Finn

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:53:58Z

**Summary**: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its reported effects on the learned policy are inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity in stochastic environments. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes consistency over time while maintaining reactivity to unexpected changes. Experimental results show that BID boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Code and videos are available at https://bid-robot.github.io.

### CultureLLM: Incorporating Cultural Differences into Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Cheng Li, Mengzhou Chen, Jindong Wang, Sunayana Sitaram, Xing Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:52:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are reported to be partial to certain cultures owing to the training data dominance from the English corpora. Since multilingual cultural data are often expensive to collect, existing efforts handle this by prompt engineering or culture-specific pre-training. However, they might overlook the knowledge deficiency of low-resource culture and require extensive computing resources. In this paper, we propose CultureLLM, a cost-effective solution to incorporate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureLLM adopts World Value Survey (WVS) as seed data and generates semantically equivalent training data via the proposed semantic data augmentation. Using only 50 seed samples from WVS with augmented data, we fine-tune culture-specific LLMs and one unified model (CultureLLM-One) for 9 cultures covering rich and low-resource languages. Extensive experiments on 60 culture-related datasets demonstrate that CultureLLM significantly outperforms various counterparts such as GPT-3.5 (by 8.1%) and Gemini Pro (by 9.5%) with comparable performance to GPT-4 or even better. Our human study shows that the generated samples are semantically equivalent to the original samples, providing an effective solution for LLMs augmentation. Code is released at https://github.com/Scarelette/CultureLLM.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:47:15Z

**Summary**: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports a wide range of BI tasks for different data roles by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.

### Low-power SNN-based audio source localisation using a Hilbert Transform   spike encoding scheme
**Authors**: Saeid Haghighatshoar, Dylan R Muir

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:23:38Z

**Summary**: Sound source localisation is used in many consumer devices, to isolate audio from individual speakers and reject noise. Localization is frequently accomplished by ``beamforming'', which combines phase-shifted audio streams to increase power from chosen source directions, under a known microphone array geometry. Dense band-pass filters are often needed to obtain narrowband signal components from wideband audio. These approaches achieve high accuracy, but narrowband beamforming is computationally demanding, and not ideal for low-power IoT devices. We demonstrate a novel method for sound source localisation on arbitrary microphone arrays, designed for efficient implementation in ultra-low-power spiking neural networks (SNNs). We use a Hilbert transform to avoid dense band-pass filters, and introduce a new event-based encoding method that captures the phase of the complex analytic signal. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for SNN methods, comparable with traditional non-SNN super-resolution beamforming. We deploy our method to low-power SNN inference hardware, with much lower power consumption than super-resolution methods. We demonstrate that signal processing approaches co-designed with spiking neural network implementations can achieve much improved power efficiency. Our new Hilbert-transform-based method for beamforming can also improve the efficiency of traditional DSP-based signal processing.

### Cascaded Multi-Scale Attention for Enhanced Multi-Scale Feature   Extraction and Interaction with Low-Resolution Images
**Authors**: Xiangyong Lu, Masanori Suganuma, Takayuki Okatani

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:23:19Z

**Summary**: In real-world applications of image recognition tasks, such as human pose estimation, cameras often capture objects, like human bodies, at low resolutions. This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible. Code is available at https://github.com/xyongLu/CMSA.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:15:04Z

**Summary**: Open-universe 3D layout generation arranges unlabeled 3D assets conditioned on language instruction. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with generating physically plausible 3D scenes and adherence to input instructions, particularly in cluttered scenes. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve performance.

### FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL
**Authors**: Woosung Koh, Wonbeen Oh, Siyeol Kim, Suhin Shin, Hyeongjin Kim, Jaein Jang, Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:59:09Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.

### VideoICL: Confidence-based Iterative In-context Learning for   Out-of-Distribution Video Understanding
**Authors**: Kangsan Kim, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Woongyeong Yeo, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:54:43Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in video large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly improved their video understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, their performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that are underrepresented in training data. Traditional methods like fine-tuning on OOD datasets are impractical due to high computational costs. While In-context learning (ICL) with demonstration examples has shown promising generalization performance in language tasks and image-language tasks without fine-tuning, applying ICL to video-language tasks faces challenges due to the limited context length in Video LMMs, as videos require longer token lengths. To address these issues, we propose VideoICL, a novel video in-context learning framework for OOD tasks that introduces a similarity-based relevant example selection strategy and a confidence-based iterative inference approach. This allows to select the most relevant examples and rank them based on similarity, to be used for inference. If the generated response has low confidence, our framework selects new examples and performs inference again, iteratively refining the results until a high-confidence response is obtained. This approach improves OOD video understanding performance by extending effective context length without incurring high costs. The experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains, especially in domain-specific scenarios, laying the groundwork for broader video comprehension applications. Code will be released at https://github.com/KangsanKim07/VideoICL

### Endogenous Interference in Randomized Experiments
**Authors**: Mengsi Gao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:44:50Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the identification and inference of treatment effects in randomized controlled trials with social interactions. Two key network features characterize the setting and introduce endogeneity: (1) latent variables may affect both network formation and outcomes, and (2) the intervention may alter network structure, mediating treatment effects. I make three contributions. First, I define parameters within a post-treatment network framework, distinguishing direct effects of treatment from indirect effects mediated through changes in network structure. I provide a causal interpretation of the coefficients in a linear outcome model. For estimation and inference, I focus on a specific form of peer effects, represented by the fraction of treated friends. Second, in the absence of endogeneity, I establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of ordinary least squares estimators. Third, if endogeneity is present, I propose addressing it through shift-share instrumental variables, demonstrating the consistency and asymptotic normality of instrumental variable estimators in relatively sparse networks. For denser networks, I propose a denoised estimator based on eigendecomposition to restore consistency. Finally, I revisit Prina (2015) as an empirical illustration, demonstrating that treatment can influence outcomes both directly and through network structure changes.

### Searching for local associations while controlling the false discovery   rate
**Authors**: Paula Gablenz, Matteo Sesia, Tianshu Sun, Chiara Sabatti

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:42:15Z

**Summary**: We introduce local conditional hypotheses that express how the relation between explanatory variables and outcomes changes across different contexts, described by covariates. By expanding upon the model-X knockoff filter, we show how to adaptively discover these local associations, all while controlling the false discovery rate. Our enhanced inferences can help explain sample heterogeneity and uncover interactions, making better use of the capabilities offered by modern machine learning models. Specifically, our method is able to leverage any model for the identification of data-driven hypotheses pertaining to different contexts. Then, it rigorously test these hypotheses without succumbing to selection bias. Importantly, our approach is efficient and does not require sample splitting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments and by studying the genetic architecture of Waist-Hip-Ratio across different sexes in the UKBiobank.

**Summary**: Clustering of nodes in Bayesian Networks (BNs) and related graphical models such as Dynamic BNs (DBNs) has been demonstrated to enhance computational efficiency and improve model learning. Typically, it involves the partitioning of the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into cliques, or optimising for some cost or criteria. Computational cost is important since BN and DBN inference, such as estimating marginal distributions given evidence or updating model parameters, is NP-hard. The challenge is exacerbated by cost dependency, where inference outcomes and hence clustering cost depends on both nodes within a cluster and the mapping of clusters that are connected by at least one arc. We propose an algorithm called Dependent Cluster MAPping (DCMAP) which is shown analytically, given an arbitrarily defined, positive cost function, to find all optimal cluster mappings, and do so with no more iterations than an equally informed algorithm. DCMAP is demonstrated on a complex systems seagrass DBN, which has 25 nodes per time-slice, and captures biological, ecological and environmental dynamics and their interactions to predict the impact of dredging stressors on resilience and their cumulative effects over time. The algorithm is employed to find clusters to optimise the computational efficiency of inferring marginal distributions given evidence. For the 25 (one time-slice) and 50-node (two time-slices) DBN, the search space size was $9.91\times10^9$ and $1.51\times10^{21}$ possible cluster mappings, respectively, but the first optimal solution was found at iteration number 856 (95\% CI 852,866), and 1569 (1566,1581) with a cost that was 4\% and 0.2\% of the naive heuristic cost, respectively. Through optimal clustering, DCMAP opens up opportunities for further research beyond improving computational efficiency, such as using clustering to minimise entropy in BN learning.

### A Physics-embedded Deep Learning Framework for Cloth Simulation
**Authors**: Zhiwei Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:15:15Z

**Summary**: Delicate cloth simulations have long been desired in computer graphics. Various methods were proposed to improve engaged force interactions, collision handling, and numerical integrations. Deep learning has the potential to achieve fast and real-time simulation, but common neural network structures often demand many parameters to capture cloth dynamics. This paper proposes a physics-embedded learning framework that directly encodes physical features of cloth simulation. The convolutional neural network is used to represent spatial correlations of the mass-spring system, after which three branches are designed to learn linear, nonlinear, and time derivate features of cloth physics. The framework can also integrate with other external forces and collision handling through either traditional simulators or sub neural networks. The model is tested across different cloth animation cases, without training with new data. Agreement with baselines and predictive realism successfully validate its generalization ability. Inference efficiency of the proposed model also defeats traditional physics simulation. This framework is also designed to easily integrate with other visual refinement techniques like wrinkle carving, which leaves significant chances to incorporate prevailing macing learning techniques in 3D cloth amination.

### Keeping Experts in the Loop: Expert-Guided Optimization for Clinical   Data Classification using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nader Karayanni, Aya Awwad, Chein-Lien Hsiao, Surish P Shanmugam

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:05:13Z

**Summary**: Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of effectively leveraging their potential in healthcare has taken center stage. A critical barrier to using LLMs for extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes lies in the prompt engineering process. Despite its pivotal role in determining task performance, a clear framework for prompt optimization remains absent. Current methods to address this gap take either a manual prompt refinement approach, where domain experts collaborate with prompt engineers to create an optimal prompt, which is time-intensive and difficult to scale, or through employing automatic prompt optimizing approaches, where the value of the input of domain experts is not fully realized. To address this, we propose StructEase, a novel framework that bridges the gap between automation and the input of human expertise in prompt engineering. A core innovation of the framework is SamplEase, an iterative sampling algorithm that identifies high-value cases where expert feedback drives significant performance improvements. This approach minimizes expert intervention, to effectively enhance classification outcomes. This targeted approach reduces labeling redundancy, mitigates human error, and enhances classification outcomes. We evaluated the performance of StructEase using a dataset of de-identified clinical narratives from the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrating significant gains in classification performance compared to current methods. Our findings underscore the value of expert integration in LLM workflows, achieving notable improvements in F1 score while maintaining minimal expert effort. By combining transparency, flexibility, and scalability, StructEase sets the foundation for a framework to integrate expert input into LLM workflows in healthcare and beyond.

### AtomR: Atomic Operator-Empowered Large Language Models for Heterogeneous   Knowledge Reasoning
**Authors**: Amy Xin, Jinxin Liu, Zijun Yao, Zhicheng Lee, Shulin Cao, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:00:18Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks, but it is still challenging for LLMs to perform knowledge-intensive complex question answering due to LLMs' inefficacy in reasoning planning and the hallucination problem. A typical solution is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which decomposes complex questions into chain-like sub-questions and applies iterative RAG at each sub-question. However, prior works exhibit sub-optimal reasoning planning and overlook dynamic knowledge retrieval from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, we propose AtomR, a novel heterogeneous knowledge reasoning framework that conducts multi-source reasoning at the atomic level. Drawing inspiration from the graph modeling of knowledge, AtomR leverages large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex questions into combinations of three atomic knowledge operators, significantly enhancing the reasoning process at both the planning and execution stages. We also introduce BlendQA, a novel evaluation benchmark tailored to assess complex heterogeneous knowledge reasoning. Experiments show that AtomR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three single-source and two multi-source reasoning benchmarks, with notable performance gains of 9.4% on 2WikiMultihop and 9.5% on BlendQA.

**Authors**: Natalie Grace Brigham, Chongjiu Gao, Tadayoshi Kohno, Franziska Roesner, Niloofar Mireshghallah

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:57:32Z

**Summary**: Journalists are among the many users of large language models (LLMs). To better understand the journalist-AI interactions, we conduct a study of LLM usage by two news agencies through browsing the WildChat dataset, identifying candidate interactions, and verifying them by matching to online published articles. Our analysis uncovers instances where journalists provide sensitive material such as confidential correspondence with sources or articles from other agencies to the LLM as stimuli and prompt it to generate articles, and publish these machine-generated articles with limited intervention (median output-publication ROUGE-L of 0.62). Based on our findings, we call for further research into what constitutes responsible use of AI, and the establishment of clear guidelines and best practices on using LLMs in a journalistic context.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:51:10Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### NüshuRescue: Revitalization of the endangered Nüshu Language with AI
**Authors**: Ivory Yang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:38:31Z

**Summary**: The preservation and revitalization of endangered and extinct languages is a meaningful endeavor, conserving cultural heritage while enriching fields like linguistics and anthropology. However, these languages are typically low-resource, making their reconstruction labor-intensive and costly. This challenge is exemplified by N\"ushu, a rare script historically used by Yao women in China for self-expression within a patriarchal society. To address this challenge, we introduce N\"ushuRescue, an AI-driven framework designed to train large language models (LLMs) on endangered languages with minimal data. N\"ushuRescue automates evaluation and expands target corpora to accelerate linguistic revitalization. As a foundational component, we developed NCGold, a 500-sentence N\"ushu-Chinese parallel corpus, the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Leveraging GPT-4-Turbo, with no prior exposure to N\"ushu and only 35 short examples from NCGold, N\"ushuRescue achieved 48.69\% translation accuracy on 50 withheld sentences and generated NCSilver, a set of 98 newly translated modern Chinese sentences of varying lengths. A sample of both NCGold and NCSilver is included in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we developed FastText-based and Seq2Seq models to further support research on N\"ushu. N\"ushuRescue provides a versatile and scalable tool for the revitalization of endangered languages, minimizing the need for extensive human input.

### CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance   Modeling in Commercial Search
**Authors**: Kaixin Wu, Yixin Ji, Zeyuan Chen, Qiang Wang, Cunxiang Wang, Hong Liu, Baijun Ji, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Jinjie Gu, Yuan Zhou, Linjian Mo

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:37:03Z

**Summary**: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.

**Authors**: Tony T. Wang, John Hughes, Henry Sleight, Rylan Schaeffer, Rajashree Agrawal, Fazl Barez, Mrinank Sharma, Jesse Mu, Nir Shavit, Ethan Perez

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:34:58Z

**Summary**: Defending large language models against jailbreaks so that they never engage in a broadly-defined set of forbidden behaviors is an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the difficulty of jailbreak-defense when we only want to forbid a narrowly-defined set of behaviors. As a case study, we focus on preventing an LLM from helping a user make a bomb. We find that popular defenses such as safety training, adversarial training, and input/output classifiers are unable to fully solve this problem. In pursuit of a better solution, we develop a transcript-classifier defense which outperforms the baseline defenses we test. However, our classifier defense still fails in some circumstances, which highlights the difficulty of jailbreak-defense even in a narrow domain.

**Summary**: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.

### CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human   Intentions toward Public Events
**Authors**: Xiaojie Yang, Hangli Ge, Jiawei Wang, Zipei Fan, Renhe Jiang, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Noboru Koshizuka

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:29:27Z

**Summary**: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called \textbf{CausalMob}, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:19:36Z

**Summary**: This study examines the capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the o1 model, in the context of literary analysis. The outputs of these models are compared directly to those produced by graduate-level human participants. By focusing on two Nobel Prize-winning short stories, 'Nine Chapters' by Han Kang, the 2024 laureate, and 'Friendship' by Jon Fosse, the 2023 laureate, the research explores the extent to which AI can engage with complex literary elements such as thematic analysis, intertextuality, cultural and historical contexts, linguistic and structural innovations, and character development. Given the Nobel Prize's prestige and its emphasis on cultural, historical, and linguistic richness, applying LLMs to these works provides a deeper understanding of both human and AI approaches to interpretation. The study uses qualitative and quantitative evaluations of coherence, creativity, and fidelity to the text, revealing the strengths and limitations of AI in tasks typically reserved for human expertise. While LLMs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities, particularly in structured tasks, they often fall short in emotional nuance and coherence, areas where human interpretation excels. This research underscores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the humanities, opening new opportunities in literary studies and beyond.

### DFRot: Achieving Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free for Rotated   LLMs with Refined Rotation
**Authors**: Jingyang Xiang, Sai Qian Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:14:31Z

**Summary**: Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomena remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.25 and 0.21 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-8B, a model known for its quantization challenges.

### Adaptive Rank, Reduced Forgetting: Knowledge Retention in Continual   Learning Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA
**Authors**: Haodong Lu, Chongyang Zhao, Jason Xue, Lina Yao, Kristen Moore, Dong Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:13:14Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether the pre-trained knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, can be retained or even enhanced during continual learning (CL) while absorbing knowledge from a data stream. Existing methods often rely on additional reference data, isolated components for distribution or domain predictions, leading to high training costs, increased inference complexity, and limited improvement potential for pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we first comprehensively analyze the effects of parameter update locations and ranks on downstream adaptation and knowledge retention. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Rank-Selective Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a universal and efficient CL approach that adaptively assigns ranks to LoRA modules based on their relevance to the current data. Unlike prior methods, our approach continually enhances the pre-trained VLM by retaining both the pre-trained knowledge and the knowledge acquired during CL. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit domain or distribution prediction and additional reference data, enabling seamless integration of new tasks while preserving pre-trained capabilities. It also maintains the original architecture and deployment pipeline of the pre-trained model without incurring any additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in continually absorbing knowledge of downstream tasks while retaining pre-trained knowledge.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Comparative Literature   Summarization with Reflective Incremental Mechanisms
**Authors**: Fernando Gabriela Garcia, Spencer Burns, Harrison Fuller

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:09:36Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce ChatCite, a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating comparative literature summaries. The ability to summarize research papers with a focus on key comparisons between studies is an essential task in academic research. Existing summarization models, while effective at generating concise summaries, fail to provide deep comparative insights. ChatCite addresses this limitation by incorporating a multi-step reasoning mechanism that extracts critical elements from papers, incrementally builds a comparative summary, and refines the output through a reflective memory process. We evaluate ChatCite on a custom dataset, CompLit-LongContext, consisting of 1000 research papers with annotated comparative summaries. Experimental results show that ChatCite outperforms several baseline methods, including GPT-4, BART, T5, and CoT, across various automatic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and the newly proposed G-Score. Human evaluation further confirms that ChatCite generates more coherent, insightful, and fluent summaries compared to these baseline models. Our method provides a significant advancement in automatic literature review generation, offering researchers a powerful tool for efficiently comparing and synthesizing scientific research.

### DyMO: Training-Free Diffusion Model Alignment with Dynamic   Multi-Objective Scheduling
**Authors**: Xin Xie, Dong Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:00:09Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion model alignment is critical for improving the alignment between the generated images and human preferences. While training-based methods are constrained by high computational costs and dataset requirements, training-free alignment methods remain underexplored and are often limited by inaccurate guidance. We propose a plug-and-play training-free alignment method, DyMO, for aligning the generated images and human preferences during inference. Apart from text-aware human preference scores, we introduce a semantic alignment objective for enhancing the semantic alignment in the early stages of diffusion, relying on the fact that the attention maps are effective reflections of the semantics in noisy images. We propose dynamic scheduling of multiple objectives and intermediate recurrent steps to reflect the requirements at different steps. Experiments with diverse pre-trained diffusion models and metrics demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

**Authors**: Heqing Zou, Tianze Luo, Guiyang Xie, Victor, Zhang, Fengmao Lv, Guangcong Wang, Junyang Chen, Zhuochen Wang, Hansheng Zhang, Huaijian Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:56:52Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.

### A privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion algorithm for   collective decision-making
**Authors**: Chaoxiong Ma, Yan Liang, Xinyu Yang, Han Wu, Huixia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:36:42Z

**Summary**: The theory of evidence reasoning has been applied to collective decision-making in recent years. However, existing distributed evidence fusion methods lead to participants' preference leakage and fusion failures as they directly exchange raw evidence and do not assess evidence credibility like centralized credible evidence fusion (CCEF) does. To do so, a privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion method with three-level consensus (PCEF) is proposed in this paper. In evidence difference measure (EDM) neighbor consensus, an evidence-free equivalent expression of EDM among neighbored agents is derived with the shared dot product protocol for pignistic probability and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective probabilities, so that evidence privacy is guaranteed due to such irreversible evidence transformation. In EDM network consensus, the non-neighbored EDMs are inferred and neighbored EDMs reach uniformity via interaction between linear average consensus (LAC) and low-rank matrix completion with rank adaptation to guarantee EDM consensus convergence and no solution of inferring raw evidence in numerical iteration style. In fusion network consensus, a privacy-preserving LAC with a self-cancelling differential privacy term is proposed, where each agent adds its randomness to the sharing content and step-by-step cancels such randomness in consensus iterations. Besides, the sufficient condition of the convergence to the CCEF is explored, and it is proven that raw evidence is impossibly inferred in such an iterative consensus. The simulations show that PCEF is close to CCEF both in credibility and fusion results and obtains higher decision accuracy with less time-comsuming than existing methods.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:20:40Z

**Summary**: Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:16:54Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Customized Concept Swapping (CCS) enable a text-to-image model to swap a concept in the source image with a customized target concept. However, the existing methods still face the challenges of inconsistency and inefficiency. They struggle to maintain consistency in both the foreground and background during concept swapping, especially when the shape difference is large between objects. Additionally, they either require time-consuming training processes or involve redundant calculations during inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce InstantSwap, a new CCS method that aims to handle sharp shape disparity at speed. Specifically, we first extract the bbox of the object in the source image automatically based on attention map analysis and leverage the bbox to achieve both foreground and background consistency. For background consistency, we remove the gradient outside the bbox during the swapping process so that the background is free from being modified. For foreground consistency, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to inject semantic information into both source and target concepts inside the box. This helps learn semantic-enhanced representations that encourage the swapping process to focus on the foreground objects. To improve swapping speed, we avoid computing gradients at each timestep but instead calculate them periodically to reduce the number of forward passes, which improves efficiency a lot with a little sacrifice on performance. Finally, we establish a benchmark dataset to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority and versatility of InstantSwap.

**Summary**: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.   To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.

### OmniCreator: Self-Supervised Unified Generation with Universal Editing
**Authors**: Haodong Chen, Lan Wang, Harry Yang, Ser-Nam Lim

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:10:19Z

**Summary**: We introduce OmniCreator, a novel framework that can conduct text-prompted unified (image+video) generation as well as editing all in one place. OmniCreator acquires generative and universal editing capabilities in a self-supervised manner, taking original text-video pairs as conditions while utilizing the same video as a denoising target to learn the semantic correspondence between video and text. During inference, when presented with a text prompt and a video, OmniCreator is capable of generating a target that is faithful to both, achieving a universal editing effect that is unconstrained as opposed to existing editing work that primarily focuses on certain editing types or relies on additional controls (e.g., structural conditions, attention features, or DDIM inversion). On the other hand, when presented with a text prompt only, OmniCreator becomes generative, producing high-quality video as a result of the semantic correspondence learned. Importantly, we found that the same capabilities extend to images as is, making OmniCreator a truly unified framework. Further, due to the lack of existing generative video editing benchmarks, we introduce the OmniBench-99 dataset, designed to evaluate the performance of generative video editing models comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCreator exhibits substantial superiority over all other models.

 ### Preliminary Investigation into Data Scaling Laws for Imitation   Learning-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Yupeng Zheng, Zhongpu Xia, Qichao Zhang, Teng Zhang, Ben Lu, Xiaochuang Huo, Chao Han, Yixian Li, Mengjie Yu, Bu Jin, Pengxuan Yang, Yuhang Zheng, Haifeng Yuan, Ke Jiang, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Dongbin Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:58:11Z

**Summary**: The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of training data; (2) a small increase in the quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment in the real world.

### T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization
**Authors**: Wenxuan Zhou, Shujian Zhang, Lingxiao Zhao, Tao Meng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:56:07Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.

### From Isolated Conversations to Hierarchical Schemas: Dynamic Tree Memory   Representation for LLMs
**Authors**: Alireza Rezazadeh, Zichao Li, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:48:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.

### Mind the Gap: Examining the Self-Improvement Capabilities of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yuda Song, Hanlin Zhang, Carson Eisenach, Sham Kakade, Dean Foster, Udaya Ghai

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:47:26Z

**Summary**: Self-improvement is a mechanism in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, post-training and test-time inference. We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries.

### LLM-Enhanced Path Planning: Safe and Efficient Autonomous Navigation   with Instructional Inputs
**Authors**: Pranav Doma, Aliasghar Arab, Xuesu Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:29:37Z

**Summary**: Autonomous navigation guided by natural language instructions is essential for improving human-robot interaction and enabling complex operations in dynamic environments. While large language models (LLMs) are not inherently designed for planning, they can significantly enhance planning efficiency by providing guidance and informing constraints to ensure safety. This paper introduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid maps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task execution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and real-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans for pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization, and adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address environmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless human-robot interaction. Our results demonstrates the potential of LLMs to design context-aware system to enhance navigation efficiency and safety in industrial and dynamic environments.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T18:10:31Z

**Summary**: In this work we explore utilizing LLMs for data augmentation for manufacturing task guidance system. The dataset consists of representative samples of interactions with technicians working in an advanced manufacturing setting. The purpose of this work to explore the task, data augmentation for the supported tasks and evaluating the performance of the existing LLMs. We observe that that task is complex requiring understanding from procedure specification documents, actions and objects sequenced temporally. The dataset consists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs that refer to the spec document and are grounded in narrations and/or video demonstrations. We compared the performance of several popular open-sourced LLMs by developing a baseline using each LLM and then compared the responses in a reference-free setting using LLM-as-a-judge and compared the ratings with crowd-workers whilst validating the ratings with experts.

### Continual Learning of Personalized Generative Face Models with   Experience Replay
**Authors**: Annie N. Wang, Luchao Qi, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:56:23Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel continual learning problem: how to sequentially update the weights of a personalized 2D and 3D generative face model as new batches of photos in different appearances, styles, poses, and lighting are captured regularly. We observe that naive sequential fine-tuning of the model leads to catastrophic forgetting of past representations of the individual's face. We then demonstrate that a simple random sampling-based experience replay method is effective at mitigating catastrophic forgetting when a relatively large number of images can be stored and replayed. However, for long-term deployment of these models with relatively smaller storage, this simple random sampling-based replay technique also forgets past representations. Thus, we introduce a novel experience replay algorithm that combines random sampling with StyleGAN's latent space to represent the buffer as an optimal convex hull. We observe that our proposed convex hull-based experience replay is more effective in preventing forgetting than a random sampling baseline and the lower bound.

### Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs
**Authors**: Yerram Varun, Rahul Madhavan, Sravanti Addepalli, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:54:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.

### Leveraging LLM for Automated Ontology Extraction and Knowledge Graph   Generation
**Authors**: Mohammad Sadeq Abolhasani, Rong Pan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:49:02Z

**Summary**: Extracting relevant and structured knowledge from large, complex technical documents within the Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) domain is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our work addresses this challenge by presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.

### AV-Odyssey Bench: Can Your Multimodal LLMs Really Understand   Audio-Visual Information?
**Authors**: Kaixiong Gong, Kaituo Feng, Bohao Li, Yibing Wang, Mofan Cheng, Shijia Yang, Jiaming Han, Benyou Wang, Yutong Bai, Zhuoran Yang, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:41:23Z

**Summary**: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Reka Core, have expanded their capabilities to include vision and audio modalities. While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information. This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components. To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs. To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment. We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations. By revealing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide useful insight for future dataset collection and model development.

**Authors**: Teng Wang, Wing-Yin Yu, Zhenqi He, Zehua Liu, Xiongwei Han, Hailei Gong, Han Wu, Wei Shi, Ruifeng She, Fangzhou Zhu, Tao Zhong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:38:54Z

**Summary**: LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, a algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions.

### Interpretable Company Similarity with Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Marco Molinari, Vladimir Tregubiak, Victor Shao, Abhimanyu Pandey, Mateusz Mikolajczak, Sebastião Kuznetsov Ryder Torres Pereira

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:34:50Z

**Summary**: Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning hedging, risk management, portfolio diversification, and more. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Clustering embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential technique for determining company similarity, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. In this paper, we explore the use of SAE features in measuring company similarity and benchmark them against (1) SIC codes and (2) Major Group codes. We conclude that SAE features can reproduce and even surpass sector classifications in quantifying fundamental characteristics of companies, evaluated by the correlation of monthly returns, a proxy for similarity, and PnL from cointegration.

### CEGI: Measuring the trade-off between efficiency and carbon emissions   for SLMs and VLMs
**Authors**: Abhas Kumar, Kapil Pathak, Rajesh Kavuru, Prabhakar Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:32:47Z

**Summary**: This paper analyzes the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) and evaluates the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions across 4 essential tasks: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Dialogue Summarization and Text-to-SQL conversion. Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.

### PrefixLLM: LLM-aided Prefix Circuit Design
**Authors**: Weihua Xiao, Venkata Sai Charan Putrevu, Raghu Vamshi Hemadri, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:26:42Z

**Summary**: Prefix circuits are fundamental components in digital adders, widely used in digital systems due to their efficiency in calculating carry signals. Synthesizing prefix circuits with minimized area and delay is crucial for enhancing the performance of modern computing systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a surprising ability to perform text generation tasks. We propose PrefixLLM, that leverages LLMs for prefix circuit synthesis. PrefixLLM transforms the prefix circuit synthesis task into a structured text generation problem, termed the Structured Prefix Circuit Representation (SPCR), and introduces an iterative framework to automatically and accurately generate valid SPCRs. We further present a design space exploration (DSE) framework that uses LLMs to iteratively search for area and delay optimized prefix circuits. Compared to state-of-the-art, PrefixLLM can reduce the area by 3.70% under the same delay constraint. This work highlights the use of LLMs in the synthesis of arithmetic circuits, which can be transformed into the structured text generation.

### OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Junyuan Zhang, Qintong Zhang, Bin Wang, Linke Ouyang, Zichen Wen, Ying Li, Ka-Ho Chow, Conghui He, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:23:47Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 350 carefully selected unstructured PDF documents from six real-world RAG application domains, along with Q&As derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of employing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without OCR in RAG systems. Code: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench

### Explainable CTR Prediction via LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Xiaohan Yu, Li Zhang, Chong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T17:17:27Z

**Summary**: Recommendation Systems have become integral to modern user experiences, but lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Existing explainable recommendation methods are hindered by reliance on a post-hoc paradigm, wherein explanation generators are trained independently of the underlying recommender models. This paradigm necessitates substantial human effort in data construction and raises concerns about explanation reliability. In this paper, we present ExpCTR, a novel framework that integrates large language model based explanation generation directly into the CTR prediction process. Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning, we employ two carefully designed reward mechanisms, LC alignment, which ensures explanations reflect user intentions, and IC alignment, which maintains consistency with traditional ID-based CTR models. Our approach incorporates an efficient training paradigm with LoRA and a three-stage iterative process. ExpCTR circumvents the need for extensive explanation datasets while fostering synergy between CTR prediction and explanation generation. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpCTR significantly enhances both recommendation accuracy and interpretability across three real-world datasets.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:55:24Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.

### Semantic Tokens in Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Joel Suro

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:52:06Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures have recently garnered significant attention for their ability to improve truth grounding and coherence in natural language processing tasks. However, the reliability of RAG systems in producing accurate answers diminishes as the volume of data they access increases. Even with smaller datasets, these systems occasionally fail to address simple queries. This issue arises from their dependence on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which can introduce uncertainty into the system's outputs. In this work, I propose a novel Comparative RAG system that introduces an evaluator module to bridge the gap between probabilistic RAG systems and deterministically verifiable responses. The evaluator compares external recommendations with the retrieved document chunks, adding a decision-making layer that enhances the system's reliability. This approach ensures that the chunks retrieved are both semantically relevant and logically consistent with deterministic insights, thereby improving the accuracy and overall efficiency of RAG systems. This framework paves the way for more reliable and scalable question-answering applications in domains requiring high precision and verifiability.

### Patent-CR: A Dataset for Patent Claim Revision
**Authors**: Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:43:42Z

**Summary**: This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.

**Authors**: Zehan Qi, Xiao Liu, Iat Long Iong, Hanyu Lai, Xueqiao Sun, Wenyi Zhao, Yu Yang, Xinyue Yang, Jiadai Sun, Shuntian Yao, Tianjie Zhang, Wei Xu, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:37:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous agents, particularly in web-based tasks. However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.

**Authors**: Zhaohui Yang, Wei Xu, Le Liang, Yuanhao Cui, Zhijin Qin, Merouane Debbah

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:32:19Z

**Summary**: Combining wireless communication with large artificial intelligence (AI) models can open up a myriad of novel application scenarios. In sixth generation (6G) networks, ubiquitous communication and computing resources allow large AI models to serve democratic large AI models-related services to enable real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, the security considerations and sustainable communication resources limit the deployment of large AI models over distributed wireless networks. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of privacy, security, and trustworthy for distributed wireless large AI model (WLAM). In particular, the detailed privacy and security are analysis for distributed WLAM is fist revealed. The classifications and theoretical findings about privacy and security in distributed WLAM are discussed. Then the trustworthy and ethics for implementing distributed WLAM are described. Finally, the comprehensive applications of distributed WLAM is provided in the aspect of electromagnetic signal processing.

### LLMForecaster: Improving Seasonal Event Forecasts with Unstructured   Textual Data
**Authors**: Hanyu Zhang, Chuck Arvin, Dmitry Efimov, Michael W. Mahoney, Dominique Perrault-Joncas, Shankar Ramasubramanian, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Malcolm Wolff

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:18:42Z

**Summary**: Modern time-series forecasting models often fail to make full use of rich unstructured information about the time series themselves. This lack of proper conditioning can lead to obvious model failures; for example, models may be unaware of the details of a particular product, and hence fail to anticipate seasonal surges in customer demand in the lead up to major exogenous events like holidays for clearly relevant products. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces a novel forecast post-processor -- which we call LLMForecaster -- that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) to incorporate unstructured semantic and contextual information and historical data to improve the forecasts from an existing demand forecasting pipeline. In an industry-scale retail application, we demonstrate that our technique yields statistically significantly forecast improvements across several sets of products subject to holiday-driven demand surges.

### The PRISM Alignment Dataset: What Participatory, Representative and   Individualised Human Feedback Reveals About the Subjective and Multicultural   Alignment of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hannah Rose Kirk, Alexander Whitefield, Paul Röttger, Andrew Bean, Katerina Margatina, Juan Ciro, Rafael Mosquera, Max Bartolo, Adina Williams, He He, Bertie Vidgen, Scott A. Hale

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:18:10Z

**Summary**: Human feedback is central to the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, open questions remain about methods (how), domains (where), people (who) and objectives (to what end) of feedback processes. To navigate these questions, we introduce PRISM, a dataset that maps the sociodemographics and stated preferences of 1,500 diverse participants from 75 countries, to their contextual preferences and fine-grained feedback in 8,011 live conversations with 21 LLMs. With PRISM, we contribute (i) wider geographic and demographic participation in feedback; (ii) census-representative samples for two countries (UK, US); and (iii) individualised ratings that link to detailed participant profiles, permitting personalisation and attribution of sample artefacts. We target subjective and multicultural perspectives on value-laden and controversial issues, where we expect interpersonal and cross-cultural disagreement. We use PRISM in three case studies to demonstrate the need for careful consideration of which humans provide what alignment data.

### EVOR: Evolving Retrieval for Code Generation
**Authors**: Hongjin Su, Shuyang Jiang, Yuhang Lai, Haoyuan Wu, Boao Shi, Che Liu, Qian Liu, Tao Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T15:56:26Z

**Summary**: Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been successfully applied in code generation. However, existing pipelines for retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) employ static knowledge bases with a single source, limiting the adaptation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to domains they have insufficient knowledge of. In this work, we develop a novel pipeline, EVOR, that employs the synchronous evolution of both queries and diverse knowledge bases. On two realistic settings where the external knowledge is required to solve code generation tasks, we compile four new datasets associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages, named EVOR-BENCH. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOR achieves two to four times of execution accuracy compared to other methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024), DocPrompting (Zhou et al., 2023), etc. We demonstrate that EVOR is flexible and can be easily combined with them to achieve further improvement. Further analysis reveals that EVOR benefits from the synchronous evolution of queries and documents and the diverse information sources in the knowledge base. We hope that our studies will inspire more insights into the design of advanced RACG pipelines in future research. Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.

### Fast and reliable uncertainty quantification with neural network   ensembles for industrial image classification
**Authors**: Arthur Thuy, Dries F. Benoit

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T15:35:24Z

**Summary**: Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.

### A Probabilistic Perspective on Unlearning and Alignment for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yan Scholten, Stephan Günnemann, Leo Schwinn

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:31:41Z

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an open research problem. Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated via greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to capture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate estimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical contexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are crucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation framework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability guarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are application-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates about model capabilities before deployment. Through a case study focused on unlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate successful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that most if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in these models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy optimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves unlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks. Our proposed shift from point estimates to probabilistic evaluations of output distributions represents an important step toward comprehensive evaluations of LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/yascho/probabilistic-unlearning.

### BayLing 2: A Multilingual Large Language Model with Efficient Language   Alignment
**Authors**: Shaolei Zhang, Kehao Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Yan Zhou, Xiaodong Liu, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:17:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and vast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these abilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively limited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore crucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive approach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct instruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for over 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing 2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions, comprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and cross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning based on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages. Using Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B, and BayLing-2-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For multilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior performance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual knowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant improvements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its capability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing maintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the performance in low-resource languages. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.

### DP-2Stage: Adapting Language Models as Differentially Private Tabular   Data Generators
**Authors**: Tejumade Afonja, Hui-Po Wang, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T14:10:09Z

**Summary**: Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose \ours, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.

### Gracefully Filtering Backdoor Samples for Generative Large Language   Models without Retraining
**Authors**: Zongru Wu, Pengzhou Cheng, Lingyong Fang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T13:43:36Z

**Summary**: Backdoor attacks remain significant security threats to generative large language models (LLMs). Since generative LLMs output sequences of high-dimensional token logits instead of low-dimensional classification logits, most existing backdoor defense methods designed for discriminative models like BERT are ineffective for generative LLMs. Inspired by the observed differences in learning behavior between backdoor and clean mapping in the frequency space, we transform gradients of each training sample, directly influencing parameter updates, into the frequency space. Our findings reveal a distinct separation between the gradients of backdoor and clean samples in the frequency space. Based on this phenomenon, we propose Gradient Clustering in the Frequency Space for Backdoor Sample Filtering (GraCeFul), which leverages sample-wise gradients in the frequency space to effectively identify backdoor samples without requiring retraining LLMs. Experimental results show that GraCeFul outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, GraCeFul exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, achieving nearly 100% recall and F1 scores in identifying backdoor samples, reducing the average success rate of various backdoor attacks to 0% with negligible drops in clean accuracy across multiple free-style question answering datasets. Additionally, GraCeFul generalizes to Llama-2 and Vicuna. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GraceFul.

### GerPS-Compare: Comparing NER methods for legal norm analysis
**Authors**: Sarah T. Bachinger, Christoph Unger, Robin Erd, Leila Feddoul, Clara Lachenmaier, Sina Zarrieß, Birgitta König-Ries

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:46:06Z

**Summary**: We apply NER to a particular sub-genre of legal texts in German: the genre of legal norms regulating administrative processes in public service administration. The analysis of such texts involves identifying stretches of text that instantiate one of ten classes identified by public service administration professionals. We investigate and compare three methods for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect these classes: a Rule-based system, deep discriminative models, and a deep generative model. Our results show that Deep Discriminative models outperform both the Rule-based system as well as the Deep Generative model, the latter two roughly performing equally well, outperforming each other in different classes. The main cause for this somewhat surprising result is arguably the fact that the classes used in the analysis are semantically and syntactically heterogeneous, in contrast to the classes used in more standard NER tasks. Deep Discriminative models appear to be better equipped for dealing with this heterogenerity than both generic LLMs and human linguists designing rule-based NER systems.

### PolarBEVDet: Exploring Polar Representation for Multi-View 3D Object   Detection in Bird's-Eye-View
**Authors**: Zichen Yu, Quanli Liu, Wei Wang, Liyong Zhang, Xiaoguang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:39:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, LSS-based multi-view 3D object detection provides an economical and deployment-friendly solution for autonomous driving. However, all the existing LSS-based methods transform multi-view image features into a Cartesian Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) representation, which does not take into account the non-uniform image information distribution and hardly exploits the view symmetry. In this paper, in order to adapt the image information distribution and preserve the view symmetry by regular convolution, we propose to employ the polar BEV representation to substitute the Cartesian BEV representation. To achieve this, we elaborately tailor three modules: a polar view transformer to generate the polar BEV representation, a polar temporal fusion module for fusing historical polar BEV features and a polar detection head to predict the polar-parameterized representation of the object. In addition, we design a 2D auxiliary detection head and a spatial attention enhancement module to improve the quality of feature extraction in perspective view and BEV, respectively. Finally, we integrate the above improvements into a novel multi-view 3D object detector, PolarBEVDet. Experiments on nuScenes show that PolarBEVDet achieves the superior performance. The code is available at https://github.com/Yzichen/PolarBEVDet.git.

### A Multi-Agent Framework for Extensible Structured Text Generation in   PLCs
**Authors**: Donghao Yang, Aolang Wu, Tianyi Zhang, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Xiaoli Lian, Yuming Ren, Jiaji Tian

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:05:56Z

**Summary**: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are microcomputers essential for automating factory operations. Structured Text (ST), a high-level language adhering to the IEC 61131-3 standard, is pivotal for PLCs due to its ability to express logic succinctly and to seamlessly integrate with other languages within the same standard. However, vendors develop their own customized versions of ST, and the lack of comprehensive and standardized documentation for the full semantics of ST has contributed to inconsistencies in how the language is implemented. Consequently, the steep learning curve associated with ST, combined with ever-evolving industrial requirements, presents significant challenges for developers. In response to these issues, we present AutoPLC, an LLM-based approach designed to automate the generation of vendor-specific ST code. To facilitate effective code generation, we first built a comprehensive knowledge base, including Rq2ST Case Library (requirements and corresponding implementations) and Instruction libraries. Then we developed a retrieval module to incorporate the domain-specific knowledge by identifying pertinent cases and instructions, guiding the LLM to generate code that meets the requirements. In order to verify and improve the quality of the generated code, we designed an adaptable code checker. If errors are detected, we initiate an iterative self-improvement process to instruct the LLM to revise the generated code. We evaluate AutoPLC's performance against seven state-of-the-art baselines using three benchmarks, one for open-source basic ST and two for commercial Structured Control Language (SCL) from Siemens. The results show that our approach consistently achieves superior performance across all benchmarks. Ablation study emphasizes the significance of our modules. Further manual analysis confirm the practical utility of the ST code generated by AutoPLC.

### HERO: Hint-Based Efficient and Reliable Query Optimizer
**Authors**: Sergey Zinchenko, Sergey Iazov

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:58:34Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel model for learned query optimization which provides query hints leading to better execution plans. The model addresses the three key challenges in learned hint-based query optimization: reliable hint recommendation (ensuring non-degradation of query latency), efficient hint exploration, and fast inference. We provide an in-depth analysis of existing NN-based approaches to hint-based optimization and experimentally confirm the named challenges for them. Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints. Controlling the degree of parallelism (query dop) in addition to operator-related hints enables our model to achieve 3x latency improvement on JOB benchmark which sets a new standard for optimization. Our model is interpretable and easy to debug, which is particularly important for deployment in production.

### ScImage: How Good Are Multimodal Large Language Models at Scientific   Text-to-Image Generation?
**Authors**: Leixin Zhang, Steffen Eger, Yinjie Cheng, Weihe Zhai, Jonas Belouadi, Christoph Leiter, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Fahimeh Moafian, Zhixue Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:52:06Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual instructions. However, their performance in generating scientific images--a critical application for accelerating scientific progress--remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing ScImage, a benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific images from textual descriptions. ScImage assesses three key dimensions of understanding: spatial, numeric, and attribute comprehension, as well as their combinations, focusing on the relationships between scientific objects (e.g., squares, circles). We evaluate five models, GPT-4o, Llama, AutomaTikZ, Dall-E, and StableDiffusion, using two modes of output generation: code-based outputs (Python, TikZ) and direct raster image generation. Additionally, we examine four different input languages: English, German, Farsi, and Chinese. Our evaluation, conducted with 11 scientists across three criteria (correctness, relevance, and scientific accuracy), reveals that while GPT-4o produces outputs of decent quality for simpler prompts involving individual dimensions such as spatial, numeric, or attribute understanding in isolation, all models face challenges in this task, especially for more complex prompts.

### 5G NR Positioning with OpenAirInterface: Tools and Methodologies
**Authors**: Rakesh Mundlamuri, Rajeev Gangula, Florian Kaltenberger, Raymond Knopp

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:20:53Z

**Summary**: The fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) technology is expected to provide precise and reliable positioning capabilities along with high data rates. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started introducing positioning techniques from Release-16 based on time, angle, and signal strength using reference signals. However, validating these techniques with experimental prototypes is crucial before successful real-world deployment. This work provides useful tools and implementation details that are required in performing 5G positioning experiments with OpenAirInterface (OAI). As an example use case, we present an round trip time (RTT) estimation test-bed based on OAI and discusses the real-word experiment and measurement process.

### UniForm: A Reuse Attention Mechanism Optimized for Efficient Vision   Transformers on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Seul-Ki Yeom, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T10:04:15Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, but their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reuse Attention mechanism, tailored for efficient memory access and computational optimization, enabling seamless operation on resource-constrained platforms without compromising performance. Unlike traditional multi-head attention (MHA), which redundantly computes separate attention matrices for each head, Reuse Attention consolidates these computations into a shared attention matrix, significantly reducing memory overhead and computational complexity. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and downstream tasks show that the proposed UniForm models leveraging Reuse Attention achieve state-of-the-art imagenet classification accuracy while outperforming existing attention mechanisms, such as Linear Attention and Flash Attention, in inference speed and memory scalability. Notably, UniForm-l achieves a 76.7% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 21.8ms inference time on edge devices like the Jetson AGX Orin, representing up to a 5x speedup over competing benchmark methods. These results demonstrate the versatility of Reuse Attention across high-performance GPUs and edge platforms, paving the way for broader real-time applications

### Morescient GAI for Software Engineering (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Marcus Kessel, Colin Atkinson

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:51:23Z

**Summary**: The ability of Generative AI (GAI) technology to automatically check, synthesize and modify software engineering artifacts promises to revolutionize all aspects of software engineering. Using GAI for software engineering tasks is consequently one of the most rapidly expanding fields of software engineering research, with over a hundred LLM-based code models having been published since 2021. However, the overwhelming majority of existing code models share a major weakness - they are exclusively trained on the syntactic facet of software, significantly lowering their trustworthiness in tasks dependent on software semantics. To address this problem, a new class of "Morescient" GAI is needed that is "aware" of (i.e., trained on) both the semantic and static facets of software. This, in turn, will require a new generation of software observation platforms capable of generating large quantities of execution observations in a structured and readily analyzable way. In this paper, we present a vision and roadmap for how such "Morescient" GAI models can be engineered, evolved and disseminated according to the principles of open science.

### A Good Foundation is Worth Many Labels: Label-Efficient Panoptic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Niclas Vödisch, Kürsat Petek, Markus Käppeler, Abhinav Valada, Wolfram Burgard

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:50:03Z

**Summary**: A key challenge for the widespread application of learning-based models for robotic perception is to significantly reduce the required amount of annotated training data while achieving accurate predictions. This is essential not only to decrease operating costs but also to speed up deployment time. In this work, we address this challenge for PAnoptic SegmenTation with fEw Labels (PASTEL) by exploiting the groundwork paved by visual foundation models. We leverage descriptive image features from such a model to train two lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and object boundary detection, using very few annotated training samples. We then merge their predictions via a novel fusion module that yields panoptic maps based on normalized cut. To further enhance the performance, we utilize self-training on unlabeled images selected by a feature-driven similarity scheme. We underline the relevance of our approach by employing PASTEL to important robot perception use cases from autonomous driving and agricultural robotics. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PASTEL significantly outperforms previous methods for label-efficient segmentation even when using fewer annotations. The code of our work is publicly available at http://pastel.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

**Summary**: Code readability is an important indicator of software maintenance as it can significantly impact maintenance efforts. Recently, LLM (large language models) have been utilized for code readability evaluation. However, readability evaluation differs among developers, so personalization of the evaluation by LLM is needed. This study proposes a method which calibrates the evaluation, using collaborative filtering. Our preliminary analysis suggested that the method effectively enhances the accuracy of the readability evaluation using LLMs.

### LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation
**Authors**: Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:25:11Z

**Summary**: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

### Learn More by Using Less: Distributed Learning with Energy-Constrained   Devices
**Authors**: Roberto Pereira, Cristian J. Vaca-Rubio, Luis Blanco

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:06:57Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed model training across decentralized, privacy-preserving devices, but the different energy capacities of participating devices (system heterogeneity) constrain real-world implementations. These energy limitations not only reduce model accuracy but also increase dropout rates, impacting on convergence in practical FL deployments. In this work, we propose LeanFed, an energy-aware FL framework designed to optimize client selection and training workloads on battery-constrained devices. LeanFed leverages adaptive data usage by dynamically adjusting the fraction of local data each device utilizes during training, thereby maximizing device participation across communication rounds while ensuring they do not run out of battery during the process. We rigorously evaluate LeanFed against traditional FedAvg on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, simulating various levels of data heterogeneity and device participation rates. Results show that LeanFed consistently enhances model accuracy and stability, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity and limited battery life, by mitigating client dropout and extending device availability. This approach demonstrates the potential of energy-efficient, privacy-preserving FL in real-world, large-scale applications, setting a foundation for robust and sustainable pervasive AI on resource-constrained networks.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:06:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their adoption is limited by high computational costs during inference. While increasing parameter counts enhances accuracy, it also widens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a framework to accelerate LLM inference on specific hardware while preserving their capabilities. Through an innovative application of neural architecture search (NAS) at an unprecedented scale, Puzzle systematically optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters under hardware constraints. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization.   We demonstrate the real-world impact of our framework through Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while preserving 98.4% of the original model's capabilities. Nemotron-51B currently stands as the most accurate language model capable of inference on a single GPU with large batch sizes. Remarkably, this transformation required just 45B training tokens, compared to over 15T tokens used for the 70B model it was derived from. This establishes a new paradigm where powerful models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible compromise of their capabilities, demonstrating that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection. With the release of Nemotron-51B and the presentation of the Puzzle framework, we provide practitioners immediate access to state-of-the-art language modeling capabilities at significantly reduced computational costs.

### Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Upper Mid-Band 6G Networks: Gain   or Pain?
**Authors**: Ferdi Kara, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T09:00:41Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as one of the most studied topics in recent years, hailed as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize future wireless systems. While RISs are recognized for their ability to enhance spectral efficiency, coverage, and the reliability of wireless channels, several challenges remain. Notably, convincing and profitable use cases must be developed before widespread commercial deployment can be realized. The first sixth-generation (6G) networks will most likely utilize upper mid-band frequencies (i.e., 7-24\,GHz). This is regarded as the \textit{golden band} since it combines good coverage, much new spectrum, and enables many antennas in compact form factors. There has been much prior work on channel modeling, coexistence, and possible implementation scenarios for these bands. There are significant frequency-specific challenges related to RIS deployment, use cases, number of required elements, channel estimation, and control. These are previously unaddressed for the upper mid-band. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring various use cases, including RIS-assisted fixed wireless access (FWA), enhanced capacity in mobile communications, and increased reliability at the cell edge. We identify the conditions under which RIS can provide major benefits and optimal strategies for deploying RIS to enhance the performance of 6G upper mid-band communication systems.

### A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Aspect-Based   Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Changzhi Zhou, Dandan Song, Yuhang Tian, Zhijing Wu, Hao Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Jun Yang, Ziyi Yang, Shuhao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:54:17Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of natural language processing, revolutionizing numerous downstream tasks with powerful reasoning and generation abilities. For example, In-Context Learning (ICL) introduces a fine-tuning-free paradigm, allowing out-of-the-box LLMs to execute downstream tasks by analogy learning without any fine-tuning. Besides, in a fine-tuning-dependent paradigm where substantial training data exists, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), as the cost-effective methods, enable LLMs to achieve excellent performance comparable to full fine-tuning.   However, these fascinating techniques employed by LLMs have not been fully exploited in the ABSA field. Previous works probe LLMs in ABSA by merely using randomly selected input-output pairs as demonstrations in ICL, resulting in an incomplete and superficial evaluation. In this paper, we shed light on a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in the ABSA field, involving 13 datasets, 8 ABSA subtasks, and 6 LLMs. Specifically, we design a unified task formulation to unify ``multiple LLMs for multiple ABSA subtasks in multiple paradigms.'' For the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm, we efficiently fine-tune LLMs using instruction-based multi-task learning. For the fine-tuning-free paradigm, we propose 3 demonstration selection strategies to stimulate the few-shot abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art performance compared to fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) in the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm. More importantly, in the fine-tuning-free paradigm where SLMs are ineffective, LLMs with ICL still showcase impressive potential and even compete with fine-tuned SLMs on some ABSA subtasks.

### Connecting Large Language Models with Blockchain: Advancing the   Evolution of Smart Contracts from Automation to Intelligence
**Authors**: Youquan Xian, Xueying Zeng, Duancheng Xuan, Danping Yang, Chunpei Li, Peng Fan, Peng Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:35:51Z

**Summary**: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.

**Authors**: Marta Victoria, Zhe Zhang, Gorm B. Andresen, Parisa Rahdan, Ebbe K. Gøtske

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:33:42Z

**Summary**: Energy communities are promoted in the European legislation as a strategy to enable citizen participation in the energy transition. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, due to their distributed nature, present an opportunity to create such communities. At Aarhus University (Denmark), we have established an energy community consisting of a 98-kW rooftop solar PV installation, crowdsourced by students and employees of the university. The participants can buy one or several shares of the installation (which is divided into 900 shares), the electricity is consumed by the university, and the shareowners receive some economic compensation every year. The road to establishing this energy community has been rough, and we have gathered many learnings. In this manuscript, we present the 10 largest challenges which might arise when setting up a university energy community and our particular approach to facing them. Sharing these learnings might pave the way for those willing to establish their own energy community. We also include policy recommendations at a European, national, and municipality levels to facilitate the deployment of energy communities

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:29:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

### Demystifying Language Model Forgetting with Low-rank Example   Associations
**Authors**: Xisen Jin, Xiang Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:03:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) suffer from forgetting of upstream data when fine-tuned. Despite efforts on mitigating forgetting, few have investigated whether, and how forgotten upstream examples are dependent on and associated with newly learned tasks. Insights on such associations enable efficient and targeted mitigation of forgetting. In this paper, we empirically analyze forgetting (measured in log-perplexity increase) that occurs in $N$ upstream examples of language modeling or instruction-tuning after fine-tuning LLMs on one of $M$ new tasks, visualized in $M\times N$ matrices. We demonstrate that the matrices display simple low-rank patterns, often well-approximated with multiplicative scalar effects of upstream examples and newly learned tasks. We also examine fine-grained associations with visualization and statistics. Leveraging the low-rank nature of the associations, we predict forgetting of upstream examples when fine-tuning on unseen tasks with matrix completion over the empirical associations. This enables fast identification of most forgotten examples without expensive inference on the entire upstream data. The approach, despite simplicity, outperforms prior approaches that learn semantic relationships of learned tasks and upstream examples with LMs for predicting forgetting. We demonstrate the practical utility of our analysis by showing statistically significantly reduced forgetting as we upweight predicted examples for replay at fine-tuning.

### Sibyl: Empowering Empathetic Dialogue Generation in Large Language   Models via Sensible and Visionary Commonsense Inference
**Authors**: Lanrui Wang, Jiangnan Li, Chenxu Yang, Zheng Lin, Hongyin Tang, Huan Liu, Yanan Cao, Jingang Wang, Weiping Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:57:33Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a heightened interest in building chatbots based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human-like qualities in multi-turn conversations. Despite having access to commonsense knowledge to better understand the psychological aspects and causality of dialogue context, even these powerful LLMs struggle to achieve the goals of empathy and emotional support. Current commonsense knowledge derived from dialogue contexts is inherently limited and often fails to adequately anticipate the future course of a dialogue. This lack of foresight can mislead LLMs and hinder their ability to provide effective support. In response to this challenge, we present an innovative framework named Sensible and Visionary Commonsense Knowledge (Sibyl). Designed to concentrate on the immediately succeeding dialogue, this paradigm equips LLMs with the capability to uncover the implicit requirements of the conversation, aiming to elicit more empathetic responses. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our paradigm for acquiring commonsense knowledge into LLMs comprehensively enhances the quality of their responses.

### BANER: Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition
**Authors**: Quanjiang Guo, Yihong Dong, Ling Tian, Zhao Kang, Yu Zhang, Sijie Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:51:14Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent success of two-stage prototypical networks in few-shot named entity recognition (NER), challenges such as over/under-detected false spans in the span detection stage and unaligned entity prototypes in the type classification stage persist. Additionally, LLMs have not proven to be effective few-shot information extractors in general. In this paper, we propose an approach called Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition to address these issues. We introduce a boundary-aware contrastive learning strategy to enhance the LLM's ability to perceive entity boundaries for generalized entity spans. Additionally, we utilize LoRAHub to align information from the target domain to the source domain, thereby enhancing adaptive cross-domain classification capabilities. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms prior methods, validating its effectiveness. In particular, the proposed strategies demonstrate effectiveness across a range of LLM architectures. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/BANER.

### Model Editing for LLMs4Code: How Far are We?
**Authors**: Xiaopeng Li, Shangwen Wang, Shasha Li, Jun Ma, Jie Yu, Xiaodong Liu, Jing Wang, Bin Ji, Weimin Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:40:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) have been found to exhibit outstanding performance in the software engineering domain, especially the remarkable performance in coding tasks. However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the performance of the state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs.

### AutoGuide: Automated Generation and Selection of Context-Aware   Guidelines for Large Language Model Agents
**Authors**: Yao Fu, Dong-Ki Kim, Jaekyeom Kim, Sungryull Sohn, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Kyunghoon Bae, Honglak Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:36:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents capable of performing various sequential decision-making tasks. However, effectively guiding LLMs to perform well in unfamiliar domains like web navigation, where they lack sufficient knowledge, has proven to be difficult with the demonstration-based in-context learning paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called AutoGuide, which addresses this limitation by automatically generating context-aware guidelines from offline experiences. Importantly, each context-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows a conditional structure, clearly describing the context where it is applicable. As a result, our guidelines facilitate the provision of relevant knowledge for the agent's current decision-making process, overcoming the limitations of the conventional demonstration-based learning paradigm. Our evaluation demonstrates that AutoGuide significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex benchmark domains, including real-world web navigation.

### Development of a novel bunch oscillation recorder with RFSoC technology
**Authors**: Riku Nomaru, Gaku Mitsuka, Larry Ruckman, Ryan Herbst

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:30:01Z

**Summary**: The SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to achieve unprecedented luminosity levels, but this goal is currently hindered by Sudden Beam Loss (SBL) events. These events not only obstruct luminosity improvement but also pose a significant risk to accelerator components, the Belle II detectors, and the superconducting focusing system, potentially leading to severe damage and quenching of the superconducting system. To address this critical challenge, we have developed a novel Bunch Oscillation Recorder (BOR) based on RFSoC technology. The BOR has demonstrated high precision with a position resolution of 0.03 mm, making it a powerful tool for real-time beam monitoring. In its initial deployment, the BOR successfully recorded multiple SBL events, providing valuable data for further analysis. By strategically positioning BORs at the suspected points of SBL origin, we aim to directly identify sources of beam instability. We anticipate that this portable, high-speed BOR monitor will play a crucial role in resolving the SBL issue, ultimately helping achieve SuperKEKB's luminosity targets.

### Unlocking Tuning-Free Few-Shot Adaptability in Visual Foundation Models   by Recycling Pre-Tuned LoRAs
**Authors**: Zixuan Hu, Yongxian Wei, Li Shen, Chun Yuan, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:25:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate strong few-shot adaptability without requiring fine-tuning, positioning them ideal for data-limited and real-time applications. However, this adaptability has not yet been replicated in current Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which require explicit fine-tuning with sufficient tuning data. Besides, the pretraining-finetuning paradigm has led to the surge of numerous task-specific modular components, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). For the first time, we explore the potential of reusing diverse pre-tuned LoRAs without accessing their original training data, to achieve tuning-free few-shot adaptation in VFMs. Our framework, LoRA Recycle, distills a meta-LoRA from diverse pre-tuned LoRAs with a meta-learning objective, using surrogate data generated inversely from pre-tuned LoRAs themselves. The VFM, once equipped with the meta-LoRA, is empowered to solve new few-shot tasks in a single forward pass, akin to the in-context learning of LLMs. Additionally, we incorporate a double-efficient mechanism tailored to our framework, significantly accelerating the meta-training process while maintaining or even improving performance. Extensive experiments across various few-shot classification benchmarks across both in- and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

### Recovering implicit physics model under real-world constraints
**Authors**: Ayan Banerjee, Sandeep K. S. Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T07:11:21Z

**Summary**: Recovering a physics-driven model, i.e. a governing set of equations of the underlying dynamical systems, from the real-world data has been of recent interest. Most existing methods either operate on simulation data with unrealistically high sampling rates or require explicit measurements of all system variables, which is not amenable in real-world deployments. Moreover, they assume the timestamps of external perturbations to the physical system are known a priori, without uncertainty, implicitly discounting any sensor time-synchronization or human reporting errors. In this paper, we propose a novel liquid time constant neural network (LTC-NN) based architecture to recover underlying model of physical dynamics from real-world data. The automatic differentiation property of LTC-NN nodes overcomes problems associated with low sampling rates, the input dependent time constant in the forward pass of the hidden layer of LTC-NN nodes creates a massive search space of implicit physical dynamics, the physics model solver based data reconstruction loss guides the search for the correct set of implicit dynamics, and the use of the dropout regularization in the dense layer ensures extraction of the sparsest model. Further, to account for the perturbation timing error, we utilize dense layer nodes to search through input shifts that results in the lowest reconstruction loss. Experiments on four benchmark dynamical systems, three with simulation data and one with the real-world data show that the LTC-NN architecture is more accurate in recovering implicit physics model coefficients than the state-of-the-art sparse model recovery approaches. We also introduce four additional case studies (total eight) on real-life medical examples in simulation and with real-world clinical data to show effectiveness of our approach in recovering underlying model in practice.

### CultureLLM: Incorporating Cultural Differences into Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Cheng Li, Mengzhou Chen, Jindong Wang, Sunayana Sitaram, Xing Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:52:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are reported to be partial to certain cultures owing to the training data dominance from the English corpora. Since multilingual cultural data are often expensive to collect, existing efforts handle this by prompt engineering or culture-specific pre-training. However, they might overlook the knowledge deficiency of low-resource culture and require extensive computing resources. In this paper, we propose CultureLLM, a cost-effective solution to incorporate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureLLM adopts World Value Survey (WVS) as seed data and generates semantically equivalent training data via the proposed semantic data augmentation. Using only 50 seed samples from WVS with augmented data, we fine-tune culture-specific LLMs and one unified model (CultureLLM-One) for 9 cultures covering rich and low-resource languages. Extensive experiments on 60 culture-related datasets demonstrate that CultureLLM significantly outperforms various counterparts such as GPT-3.5 (by 8.1%) and Gemini Pro (by 9.5%) with comparable performance to GPT-4 or even better. Our human study shows that the generated samples are semantically equivalent to the original samples, providing an effective solution for LLMs augmentation. Code is released at https://github.com/Scarelette/CultureLLM.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:47:15Z

**Summary**: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports a wide range of BI tasks for different data roles by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.

**Authors**: Fan-Yun Sun, Weiyu Liu, Siyi Gu, Dylan Lim, Goutam Bhat, Federico Tombari, Manling Li, Nick Haber, Jiajun Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T06:15:04Z

**Summary**: Open-universe 3D layout generation arranges unlabeled 3D assets conditioned on language instruction. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with generating physically plausible 3D scenes and adherence to input instructions, particularly in cluttered scenes. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve performance.

### Keeping Experts in the Loop: Expert-Guided Optimization for Clinical   Data Classification using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nader Karayanni, Aya Awwad, Chein-Lien Hsiao, Surish P Shanmugam

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:05:13Z

**Summary**: Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of effectively leveraging their potential in healthcare has taken center stage. A critical barrier to using LLMs for extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes lies in the prompt engineering process. Despite its pivotal role in determining task performance, a clear framework for prompt optimization remains absent. Current methods to address this gap take either a manual prompt refinement approach, where domain experts collaborate with prompt engineers to create an optimal prompt, which is time-intensive and difficult to scale, or through employing automatic prompt optimizing approaches, where the value of the input of domain experts is not fully realized. To address this, we propose StructEase, a novel framework that bridges the gap between automation and the input of human expertise in prompt engineering. A core innovation of the framework is SamplEase, an iterative sampling algorithm that identifies high-value cases where expert feedback drives significant performance improvements. This approach minimizes expert intervention, to effectively enhance classification outcomes. This targeted approach reduces labeling redundancy, mitigates human error, and enhances classification outcomes. We evaluated the performance of StructEase using a dataset of de-identified clinical narratives from the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrating significant gains in classification performance compared to current methods. Our findings underscore the value of expert integration in LLM workflows, achieving notable improvements in F1 score while maintaining minimal expert effort. By combining transparency, flexibility, and scalability, StructEase sets the foundation for a framework to integrate expert input into LLM workflows in healthcare and beyond.

### AtomR: Atomic Operator-Empowered Large Language Models for Heterogeneous   Knowledge Reasoning
**Authors**: Amy Xin, Jinxin Liu, Zijun Yao, Zhicheng Lee, Shulin Cao, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T05:00:18Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks, but it is still challenging for LLMs to perform knowledge-intensive complex question answering due to LLMs' inefficacy in reasoning planning and the hallucination problem. A typical solution is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which decomposes complex questions into chain-like sub-questions and applies iterative RAG at each sub-question. However, prior works exhibit sub-optimal reasoning planning and overlook dynamic knowledge retrieval from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, we propose AtomR, a novel heterogeneous knowledge reasoning framework that conducts multi-source reasoning at the atomic level. Drawing inspiration from the graph modeling of knowledge, AtomR leverages large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex questions into combinations of three atomic knowledge operators, significantly enhancing the reasoning process at both the planning and execution stages. We also introduce BlendQA, a novel evaluation benchmark tailored to assess complex heterogeneous knowledge reasoning. Experiments show that AtomR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three single-source and two multi-source reasoning benchmarks, with notable performance gains of 9.4% on 2WikiMultihop and 9.5% on BlendQA.

**Authors**: Natalie Grace Brigham, Chongjiu Gao, Tadayoshi Kohno, Franziska Roesner, Niloofar Mireshghallah

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:57:32Z

**Summary**: Journalists are among the many users of large language models (LLMs). To better understand the journalist-AI interactions, we conduct a study of LLM usage by two news agencies through browsing the WildChat dataset, identifying candidate interactions, and verifying them by matching to online published articles. Our analysis uncovers instances where journalists provide sensitive material such as confidential correspondence with sources or articles from other agencies to the LLM as stimuli and prompt it to generate articles, and publish these machine-generated articles with limited intervention (median output-publication ROUGE-L of 0.62). Based on our findings, we call for further research into what constitutes responsible use of AI, and the establishment of clear guidelines and best practices on using LLMs in a journalistic context.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:51:10Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications.

### NüshuRescue: Revitalization of the endangered Nüshu Language with AI
**Authors**: Ivory Yang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:38:31Z

**Summary**: The preservation and revitalization of endangered and extinct languages is a meaningful endeavor, conserving cultural heritage while enriching fields like linguistics and anthropology. However, these languages are typically low-resource, making their reconstruction labor-intensive and costly. This challenge is exemplified by N\"ushu, a rare script historically used by Yao women in China for self-expression within a patriarchal society. To address this challenge, we introduce N\"ushuRescue, an AI-driven framework designed to train large language models (LLMs) on endangered languages with minimal data. N\"ushuRescue automates evaluation and expands target corpora to accelerate linguistic revitalization. As a foundational component, we developed NCGold, a 500-sentence N\"ushu-Chinese parallel corpus, the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Leveraging GPT-4-Turbo, with no prior exposure to N\"ushu and only 35 short examples from NCGold, N\"ushuRescue achieved 48.69\% translation accuracy on 50 withheld sentences and generated NCSilver, a set of 98 newly translated modern Chinese sentences of varying lengths. A sample of both NCGold and NCSilver is included in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we developed FastText-based and Seq2Seq models to further support research on N\"ushu. N\"ushuRescue provides a versatile and scalable tool for the revitalization of endangered languages, minimizing the need for extensive human input.

### CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance   Modeling in Commercial Search
**Authors**: Kaixin Wu, Yixin Ji, Zeyuan Chen, Qiang Wang, Cunxiang Wang, Hong Liu, Baijun Ji, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Jinjie Gu, Yuan Zhou, Linjian Mo

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:37:03Z

**Summary**: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.

**Authors**: Tony T. Wang, John Hughes, Henry Sleight, Rylan Schaeffer, Rajashree Agrawal, Fazl Barez, Mrinank Sharma, Jesse Mu, Nir Shavit, Ethan Perez

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:34:58Z

**Summary**: Defending large language models against jailbreaks so that they never engage in a broadly-defined set of forbidden behaviors is an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the difficulty of jailbreak-defense when we only want to forbid a narrowly-defined set of behaviors. As a case study, we focus on preventing an LLM from helping a user make a bomb. We find that popular defenses such as safety training, adversarial training, and input/output classifiers are unable to fully solve this problem. In pursuit of a better solution, we develop a transcript-classifier defense which outperforms the baseline defenses we test. However, our classifier defense still fails in some circumstances, which highlights the difficulty of jailbreak-defense even in a narrow domain.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:34:09Z

**Summary**: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.

### CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human   Intentions toward Public Events
**Authors**: Xiaojie Yang, Hangli Ge, Jiawei Wang, Zipei Fan, Renhe Jiang, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Noboru Koshizuka

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:29:27Z

**Summary**: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called \textbf{CausalMob}, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:19:36Z

**Summary**: This study examines the capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the o1 model, in the context of literary analysis. The outputs of these models are compared directly to those produced by graduate-level human participants. By focusing on two Nobel Prize-winning short stories, 'Nine Chapters' by Han Kang, the 2024 laureate, and 'Friendship' by Jon Fosse, the 2023 laureate, the research explores the extent to which AI can engage with complex literary elements such as thematic analysis, intertextuality, cultural and historical contexts, linguistic and structural innovations, and character development. Given the Nobel Prize's prestige and its emphasis on cultural, historical, and linguistic richness, applying LLMs to these works provides a deeper understanding of both human and AI approaches to interpretation. The study uses qualitative and quantitative evaluations of coherence, creativity, and fidelity to the text, revealing the strengths and limitations of AI in tasks typically reserved for human expertise. While LLMs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities, particularly in structured tasks, they often fall short in emotional nuance and coherence, areas where human interpretation excels. This research underscores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the humanities, opening new opportunities in literary studies and beyond.

### DFRot: Achieving Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free for Rotated   LLMs with Refined Rotation
**Authors**: Jingyang Xiang, Sai Qian Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:14:31Z

**Summary**: Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomena remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.25 and 0.21 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-8B, a model known for its quantization challenges.

### PassionSR: Post-Training Quantization with Adaptive Scale in One-Step   Diffusion based Image Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Libo Zhu, Jianze Li, Haotong Qin, Wenbo Li, Yulun Zhang, Yong Guo, Xiaokang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:14:09Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have shown superior performance at the cost of multiple denoising steps. However, even though the denoising step has been reduced to one, they require high computational costs and storage requirements, making it difficult for deployment on hardware devices. To address these issues, we propose a novel post-training quantization approach with adaptive scale in one-step diffusion (OSD) image SR, PassionSR. First, we simplify OSD model to two core components, UNet and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by removing the CLIPEncoder. Secondly, we propose Learnable Boundary Quantizer (LBQ) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET) to optimize the quantization process and manipulate activation distributions for better quantization. Finally, we design a Distributed Quantization Calibration (DQC) strategy that stabilizes the training of quantized parameters for rapid convergence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PassionSR with 8-bit and 6-bit obtains comparable visual results with full-precision model. Moreover, our PassionSR achieves significant advantages over recent leading low-bit quantization methods for image SR. Our code will be at https://github.com/libozhu03/PassionSR.

### Adaptive Rank, Reduced Forgetting: Knowledge Retention in Continual   Learning Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA
**Authors**: Haodong Lu, Chongyang Zhao, Jason Xue, Lina Yao, Kristen Moore, Dong Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:13:14Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether the pre-trained knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, can be retained or even enhanced during continual learning (CL) while absorbing knowledge from a data stream. Existing methods often rely on additional reference data, isolated components for distribution or domain predictions, leading to high training costs, increased inference complexity, and limited improvement potential for pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we first comprehensively analyze the effects of parameter update locations and ranks on downstream adaptation and knowledge retention. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Rank-Selective Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a universal and efficient CL approach that adaptively assigns ranks to LoRA modules based on their relevance to the current data. Unlike prior methods, our approach continually enhances the pre-trained VLM by retaining both the pre-trained knowledge and the knowledge acquired during CL. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit domain or distribution prediction and additional reference data, enabling seamless integration of new tasks while preserving pre-trained capabilities. It also maintains the original architecture and deployment pipeline of the pre-trained model without incurring any additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in continually absorbing knowledge of downstream tasks while retaining pre-trained knowledge.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Comparative Literature   Summarization with Reflective Incremental Mechanisms
**Authors**: Fernando Gabriela Garcia, Spencer Burns, Harrison Fuller

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T04:09:36Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce ChatCite, a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating comparative literature summaries. The ability to summarize research papers with a focus on key comparisons between studies is an essential task in academic research. Existing summarization models, while effective at generating concise summaries, fail to provide deep comparative insights. ChatCite addresses this limitation by incorporating a multi-step reasoning mechanism that extracts critical elements from papers, incrementally builds a comparative summary, and refines the output through a reflective memory process. We evaluate ChatCite on a custom dataset, CompLit-LongContext, consisting of 1000 research papers with annotated comparative summaries. Experimental results show that ChatCite outperforms several baseline methods, including GPT-4, BART, T5, and CoT, across various automatic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and the newly proposed G-Score. Human evaluation further confirms that ChatCite generates more coherent, insightful, and fluent summaries compared to these baseline models. Our method provides a significant advancement in automatic literature review generation, offering researchers a powerful tool for efficiently comparing and synthesizing scientific research.

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:56:52Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.

### Retrofitting XoM for Stripped Binaries without Embedded Data Relocation
**Authors**: Chenke Luo, Jiang Ming, Mengfei Xie, Guojun Peng, Jianming Fu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:08:27Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present PXoM, a practical technique to seamlessly retrofit XoM into stripped binaries on the x86-64 platform. As handling the mixture of code and data is a well-known challenge for XoM, most existing methods require the strict separation of code and data areas via either compile-time transformation or binary patching, so that the unreadable permission can be safely enforced at the granularity of memory pages. In contrast to previous approaches, we provide a fine-grained memory permission control mechanism to restrict the read permission of code while allowing legitimate data reads within code pages. This novelty enables PXoM to harden stripped binaries but without resorting to error-prone embedded data relocation. We leverage Intel's hardware feature, Memory Protection Keys, to offer an efficient fine-grained permission control. We measure PXoM's performance with both micro- and macro-benchmarks, and it only introduces negligible runtime overhead. Our security evaluation shows that PXoM leaves adversaries with little wiggle room to harvest all of the required gadgets, suggesting PXoM is practical for real-world deployment.

**Authors**: Shuaijiang Zhao, Tingwei Guo, Bajian Xiang, Tongtang Wan, Qiang Niu, Wei Zou, Xiangang Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T02:59:43Z

**Summary**: The GPT-4o represents a significant milestone in enabling real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, its remarkable low latency and high fluency not only capture attention but also stimulate research interest in the field. This real-time speech interaction is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid feedback and immediate responses, dramatically enhancing user experience. However, there is a notable lack of research focused on real-time large speech language models, particularly for Chinese. In this work, we present KE-Omni, a seamless large speech language model built upon Ke-SpeechChat, a large-scale high-quality synthetic speech interaction dataset consisting of 7 million Chinese and English conversations, featuring 42,002 speakers, and totaling over 60,000 hours, This contributes significantly to the advancement of research and development in this field. The demos can be accessed at \url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/KE-Team/KE-Omni}.

**Authors**: Yunkai Dang, Kaichen Huang, Jiahao Huo, Yibo Yan, Sirui Huang, Dongrui Liu, Mengxi Gao, Jie Zhang, Chen Qian, Kun Wang, Yong Liu, Jing Shao, Hui Xiong, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T02:54:31Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous fields, with large language models (LLMs) and computer vision (CV) systems driving advancements in natural language understanding and visual processing, respectively. The convergence of these technologies has catalyzed the rise of multimodal AI, enabling richer, cross-modal understanding that spans text, vision, audio, and video modalities. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, have emerged as a powerful framework, demonstrating impressive capabilities in tasks like image-text generation, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. Despite these advancements, the complexity and scale of MLLMs introduce significant challenges in interpretability and explainability, essential for establishing transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability in high-stakes applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the interpretability and explainability of MLLMs, proposing a novel framework that categorizes existing research across three perspectives: (I) Data, (II) Model, (III) Training \& Inference. We systematically analyze interpretability from token-level to embedding-level representations, assess approaches related to both architecture analysis and design, and explore training and inference strategies that enhance transparency. By comparing various methodologies, we identify their strengths and limitations and propose future research directions to address unresolved challenges in multimodal explainability. This survey offers a foundational resource for advancing interpretability and transparency in MLLMs, guiding researchers and practitioners toward developing more accountable and robust multimodal AI systems.

### DuetML: Human-LLM Collaborative Machine Learning Framework for   Non-Expert Users
**Authors**: Wataru Kawabe, Yusuke Sugano

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T02:50:50Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly impacted various domains in our everyday lives. While large language models (LLMs) offer intuitive interfaces and versatility, task-specific ML models remain valuable for their efficiency and focused performance in specialized tasks. However, developing these models requires technical expertise, making it particularly challenging for non-expert users to customize them for their unique needs. Although interactive machine learning (IML) aims to democratize ML development through user-friendly interfaces, users struggle to translate their requirements into appropriate ML tasks. We propose human-LLM collaborative ML as a new paradigm bridging human-driven IML and machine-driven LLM approaches. To realize this vision, we introduce DuetML, a framework that integrates multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as interactive agents collaborating with users throughout the ML process. Our system carefully balances MLLM capabilities with user agency by implementing both reactive and proactive interactions between users and MLLM agents. Through a comparative user study, we demonstrate that DuetML enables non-expert users to define training data that better aligns with target tasks without increasing cognitive load, while offering opportunities for deeper engagement with ML task formulation.

### Let's Think Var-by-Var: Large Language Models Enable Ad Hoc   Probabilistic Reasoning
**Authors**: Shepard Xia, Brian Lu, Jason Eisner

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T01:53:06Z

**Summary**: A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to flesh out underspecified situations using "common sense." We propose to extract that common sense from large language models (LLMs), in a form that can feed into probabilistic inference. We focus our investigation on $\textit{guesstimation}$ questions such as "How much are Airbnb listings in Newark, NJ?" Formulating a sensible answer without access to data requires drawing on, and integrating, bits of common knowledge about how $\texttt{Price}$ and $\texttt{Location}$ may relate to other variables, such as $\texttt{Property Type}$. Our framework answers such a question by synthesizing an $\textit{ad hoc}$ probabilistic model. First we prompt an LLM to propose a set of random variables relevant to the question, followed by moment constraints on their joint distribution. We then optimize the joint distribution $p$ within a log-linear family to maximize the overall constraint satisfaction. Our experiments show that LLMs can successfully be prompted to propose reasonable variables, and while the proposed numerical constraints can be noisy, jointly optimizing for their satisfaction reconciles them. When evaluated on probabilistic questions derived from three real-world tabular datasets, we find that our framework performs comparably to a direct prompting baseline in terms of total variation distance from the dataset distribution, and is similarly robust to noise.

### Teaching Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment in an   Undergraduate Computer Science Program
**Authors**: Aditya Saligrama, Cody Ho, Benjamin Tripp, Michael Abbott, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T01:34:10Z

**Summary**: Making successful use of cloud computing requires nuanced approaches to both system design and deployment methodology, involving reasoning about the elasticity, cost, and security models of cloud services. Building cloud-native applications without a firm understanding of the fundamentals of cloud engineering can leave students susceptible to cost and security pitfalls. Yet, cloud computing is not commonly taught at the undergraduate level. To address this gap, we designed an undergraduate-level course that frames cloud infrastructure deployment as a software engineering practice. Our course featured a number of hands-on assignments that gave students experience with modern, best-practice concepts and tools including infrastructure-as-code (IaC). We describe the design of the course, our experience teaching its initial offering, and provide our reflections on what worked well and potential areas for improvement. Our course material is available at https://infracourse.cloud.

### Trustful LLMs: Customizing and Grounding Text Generation with Knowledge   Bases and Dual Decoders
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Zhu, Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T01:04:10Z

**Summary**: Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.

### Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly   Financial Datasets for Academic Research
**Authors**: Julian Junyan Wang, Victor Xiaoqi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T00:59:56Z

**Summary**: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.

### Redundant Queries in DETR-Based 3D Detection Methods: Unnecessary and   Prunable
**Authors**: Lizhen Xu, Shanmin Pang, Wenzhao Qiu, Zehao Wu, Xiuxiu Bai, Kuizhi Mei, Jianru Xue

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T00:26:04Z

**Summary**: Query-based models are extensively used in 3D object detection tasks, with a wide range of pre-trained checkpoints readily available online. However, despite their popularity, these models often require an excessive number of object queries, far surpassing the actual number of objects to detect. The redundant queries result in unnecessary computational and memory costs. In this paper, we find that not all queries contribute equally -- a significant portion of queries have a much smaller impact compared to others. Based on this observation, we propose an embarrassingly simple approach called \bd{G}radually \bd{P}runing \bd{Q}ueries (GPQ), which prunes queries incrementally based on their classification scores. It is straightforward to implement in any query-based method, as it can be seamlessly integrated as a fine-tuning step using an existing checkpoint after training. With GPQ, users can easily generate multiple models with fewer queries, starting from a checkpoint with an excessive number of queries. Experiments on various advanced 3D detectors show that GPQ effectively reduces redundant queries while maintaining performance. Using our method, model inference on desktop GPUs can be accelerated by up to 1.31x. Moreover, after deployment on edge devices, it achieves up to a 67.86\% reduction in FLOPs and a 76.38\% decrease in inference time. The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/iseri27/Gpq}.

### Simplifying HPC resource selection: A tool for optimizing execution time   and cost on Azure
**Authors**: Marco A. S. Netto, Wolfgang De Savador, Davide Vanzo

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T00:07:46Z

**Summary**: Azure Cloud offers a wide range of resources for running HPC workloads, requiring users to configure their deployment by selecting VM types, number of VMs, and processes per VM. Suboptimal decisions may lead to longer execution times or additional costs for the user. We are developing an open-source tool to assist users in making these decisions by considering application input parameters, as they influence resource consumption. The tool automates the time-consuming process of setting up the cloud environment, executing the benchmarking runs, handling output, and providing users with resource selection recommendations as high level insights on run times and costs across different VM types and number of VMs. In this work, we present initial results and insights on reducing the number of cloud executions needed to provide such guidance, leveraging data analytics and optimization techniques with two well-known HPC applications: OpenFOAM and LAMMPS.

**Authors**: James Allan, Eunsol Choi, Daniel P. Lopresti, Hamed Zamani

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T00:01:48Z

**Summary**: In the fast-evolving field of information retrieval (IR), the integration of generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) is transforming how users search for and interact with information. Recognizing this paradigm shift at the intersection of IR and generative AI (IR-GenAI), a visioning workshop supported by the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) was held in July 2024 to discuss the future of IR in the age of generative AI. This workshop convened 44 experts in information retrieval, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence from academia, industry, and government to explore how generative AI can enhance IR and vice versa, and to identify the major challenges and opportunities in this rapidly advancing field.   This report contains a summary of discussions as potentially important research topics and contains a list of recommendations for academics, industry practitioners, institutions, evaluation campaigns, and funding agencies.

### LLMs4Life: Large Language Models for Ontology Learning in Life Sciences
**Authors**: Nadeen Fathallah, Steffen Staab, Alsayed Algergawy

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T23:31:52Z

**Summary**: Ontology learning in complex domains, such as life sciences, poses significant challenges for current Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing LLMs struggle to generate ontologies with multiple hierarchical levels, rich interconnections, and comprehensive class coverage due to constraints on the number of tokens they can generate and inadequate domain adaptation. To address these issues, we extend the NeOn-GPT pipeline for ontology learning using LLMs with advanced prompt engineering techniques and ontology reuse to enhance the generated ontologies' domain-specific reasoning and structural depth. Our work evaluates the capabilities of LLMs in ontology learning in the context of highly specialized and complex domains such as life science domains. To assess the logical consistency, completeness, and scalability of the generated ontologies, we use the AquaDiva ontology developed and used in the collaborative research center AquaDiva as a case study. Our evaluation shows the viability of LLMs for ontology learning in specialized domains, providing solutions to longstanding limitations in model performance and scalability.

### NitroFusion: High-Fidelity Single-Step Diffusion through Dynamic   Adversarial Training
**Authors**: Dar-Yen Chen, Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Kai Zou, Yi-Zhe Song

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T23:20:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce NitroFusion, a fundamentally different approach to single-step diffusion that achieves high-quality generation through a dynamic adversarial framework. While one-step methods offer dramatic speed advantages, they typically suffer from quality degradation compared to their multi-step counterparts. Just as a panel of art critics provides comprehensive feedback by specializing in different aspects like composition, color, and technique, our approach maintains a large pool of specialized discriminator heads that collectively guide the generation process. Each discriminator group develops expertise in specific quality aspects at different noise levels, providing diverse feedback that enables high-fidelity one-step generation. Our framework combines: (i) a dynamic discriminator pool with specialized discriminator groups to improve generation quality, (ii) strategic refresh mechanisms to prevent discriminator overfitting, and (iii) global-local discriminator heads for multi-scale quality assessment, and unconditional/conditional training for balanced generation. Additionally, our framework uniquely supports flexible deployment through bottom-up refinement, allowing users to dynamically choose between 1-4 denoising steps with the same model for direct quality-speed trade-offs. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NitroFusion significantly outperforms existing single-step methods across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly excelling in preserving fine details and global consistency.

### Making Differential Privacy Easier to Use for Data Controllers using a   Privacy Risk Indicator
**Authors**: Zhiru Zhu, Raul Castro Fernandez

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T22:14:44Z

**Summary**: Differential privacy (DP) enables private data analysis but is difficult to use in practice. In a typical DP deployment, data controllers manage individuals' sensitive data and are responsible for answering data analysts' queries while protecting individuals' privacy; they do so by choosing $\epsilon$, the privacy loss budget, which controls how much noise to add to the query output. However, it is challenging for data controllers to choose $\epsilon$ because of the difficulty of interpreting the privacy implications of such a choice on the individuals they wish to protect.   To address this challenge, we first derive a privacy risk indicator (PRI) directly from the definition of ex-post per-instance privacy loss in the DP literature. The PRI indicates the impact of choosing $\epsilon$ on individuals' privacy. We then leverage the PRI to design an algorithm to choose $\epsilon$ and release query output based on data controllers' privacy preferences. We design a modification of the algorithm that allows releasing both the query output and $\epsilon$ while satisfying differential privacy, and we propose a solution that bounds the total privacy loss when using the algorithm to answer multiple queries without requiring controllers to set the total privacy loss budget. We demonstrate our contributions through an IRB-approved user study and experimental evaluations that show the PRI is useful for helping controllers choose $\epsilon$ and our algorithms are efficient. Overall, our work contributes to making DP easier to use for controllers by lowering adoption barriers.

### AVA: Fault-tolerant Reconfigurable Geo-Replication on Heterogeneous   Clusters
**Authors**: Tejas Mane, Xiao Li, Mohammad Sadoghi, Mohsen Lesani

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T22:07:23Z

**Summary**: Fault-tolerant replicated database systems consume less energy than the compute-intensive proof-of-work blockchain. Thus, they are promising technologies for the building blocks that assemble global financial infrastructure. To facilitate global scaling, clustered replication protocols are essential in orchestrating nodes into clusters based on proximity. However, the existing approaches often assume a homogeneous and fixed model in which the number of nodes across clusters is the same and fixed, and often limited to a fail-stop fault model. This paper presents heterogeneous and reconfigurable clustered replication for the general environment with arbitrary failures. In particular, we present AVA, a fault-tolerant reconfigurable geo-replication that allows dynamic membership: replicas are allowed to join and leave clusters. We formally state and prove the safety and liveness properties of the protocol. Furthermore, our replication protocol is consensus-agnostic, meaning each cluster can utilize any local replication mechanism. In our comprehensive evaluation, we instantiate our replication with both HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt. Experiments on geo-distributed deployments on Google Cloud demonstrates that members of clusters can be reconfigured without considerably affecting transaction processing, and that heterogeneity of clusters may significantly improve throughput.

### Towards Understanding Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs: A Representation Space   Analysis
**Authors**: Yuping Lin, Pengfei He, Han Xu, Yue Xing, Makoto Yamada, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T21:48:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to a type of attack known as jailbreaking, which misleads LLMs to output harmful contents. Although there are diverse jailbreak attack strategies, there is no unified understanding on why some methods succeed and others fail. This paper explores the behavior of harmful and harmless prompts in the LLM's representation space to investigate the intrinsic properties of successful jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that successful attacks share some similar properties: They are effective in moving the representation of the harmful prompt towards the direction to the harmless prompts. We leverage hidden representations into the objective of existing jailbreak attacks to move the attacks along the acceptance direction, and conduct experiments to validate the above hypothesis using the proposed objective. We hope this study provides new insights into understanding how LLMs understand harmfulness information.

### AERO: Softmax-Only LLMs for Efficient Private Inference
**Authors**: Nandan Kumar Jha, Brandon Reagen

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T21:42:36Z

**Summary**: The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised privacy concerns for users' sensitive data, emphasizing the need for private inference (PI), where inference is performed directly on encrypted inputs. However, current PI methods face prohibitively higher communication and latency overheads, primarily due to nonlinear operations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis to understand the role of nonlinearities in transformer-based decoder-only language models. We introduce AERO, a four-step architectural optimization framework that refines the existing LLM architecture for efficient PI by systematically removing nonlinearities such as LayerNorm and GELU and reducing FLOPs counts. For the first time, we propose a Softmax-only architecture with significantly fewer FLOPs tailored for efficient PI. Furthermore, we devise a novel entropy regularization technique to improve the performance of Softmax-only models. AERO achieves up to 4.23$\times$ communication and 1.94$\times$ latency reduction. We validate the effectiveness of AERO by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art.

### Using text embedding models as text classifiers with medical data
**Authors**: Rishabh Goel

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T21:35:55Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising and LLMs have been applied to numerous fields. However, it is not trivial to implement LLMs in the medical field, due to the high standards for precision and accuracy. Currently, the diagnosis of medical ailments must be done by hand, as it is costly to build a sufficiently broad LLM that can diagnose a wide range of diseases. Here, we explore the use of vector databases and embedding models as a means of encoding and classifying text with medical text data without the need to train a new model altogether. We used various LLMs to generate the medical data, then encoded the data with a text embedding model and stored it in a vector database. We hypothesized that higher embedding dimensions coupled with descriptive data in the vector database would lead to better classifications and designed a robustness test to test our hypothesis. By using vector databases and text embedding models to classify a clinician's notes on a patient presenting with a certain ailment, we showed that these tools can be successful at classifying medical text data. We found that a higher embedding dimension did indeed yield better results, however, querying with simple data in the database was optimal for performance. We have shown in this study the applicability of text embedding models and vector databases on a small scale, and our work lays the groundwork for applying these tools on a larger scale.

### Human-centred test and evaluation of military AI
**Authors**: David Helmer, Michael Boardman, S. Kate Conroy, Adam J. Hepworth, Manoj Harjani

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T21:14:55Z

**Summary**: The REAIM 2024 Blueprint for Action states that AI applications in the military domain should be ethical and human-centric and that humans must remain responsible and accountable for their use and effects. Developing rigorous test and evaluation, verification and validation (TEVV) frameworks will contribute to robust oversight mechanisms. TEVV in the development and deployment of AI systems needs to involve human users throughout the lifecycle. Traditional human-centred test and evaluation methods from human factors need to be adapted for deployed AI systems that require ongoing monitoring and evaluation. The language around AI-enabled systems should be shifted to inclusion of the human(s) as a component of the system. Standards and requirements supporting this adjusted definition are needed, as are metrics and means to evaluate them. The need for dialogue between technologists and policymakers on human-centred TEVV will be evergreen, but dialogue needs to be initiated with an objective in mind for it to be productive. Development of TEVV throughout system lifecycle is critical to support this evolution including the issue of human scalability and impact on scale of achievable testing. Communication between technical and non technical communities must be improved to ensure operators and policy-makers understand risk assumed by system use and to better inform research and development. Test and evaluation in support of responsible AI deployment must include the effect of the human to reflect operationally realised system performance. Means of communicating the results of TEVV to those using and making decisions regarding the use of AI based systems will be key in informing risk based decisions regarding use.

### MATATA: a weak-supervised MAthematical Tool-Assisted reasoning for   Tabular Applications
**Authors**: Vishnou Vinayagame, Gregory Senay, Luis Martí

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T21:08:00Z

**Summary**: Mathematical reasoning capabilities are increasing with tool-augmented language agents, but methods often rely either on closed-source or large models, external data, or extensive prompt engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel cost-effective method to train LLM agents for tabular data problems through reasoning, planning, and tool use. With a progressive self-improvement paradigm and an iterative weak supervision, it empowers 3.8B/8B Small Language Models (SLMs), particularly suited for local hosting and sensitive business contexts where data privacy is crucial. By employing a flexible and reusable tools across different datasets, it achieves robust performance with effective scalability across shared tasks. Experiments show that MATATA reaches state-of-the-art performances on FinQA and TAT-QA among reasoning frameworks based on open-source models. Moreover, MATATA models compete with GPT-4 based frameworks on TabMWP, while being SLMs.

### Salient Information Prompting to Steer Content in Prompt-based   Abstractive Summarization
**Authors**: Lei Xu, Mohammed Asad Karim, Saket Dingliwal, Aparna Elangovan

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T21:06:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent summaries across domains using prompting techniques, reducing the need to train models for summarization applications. However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (SigExt), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using SigExt, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization. Our findings provide insights into leveraging salient information in building prompt-based summarization systems. We release our code at \url{https://github.com/amazon-science/SigExt}

**Summary**: Data annotation and synthesis generally refers to the labeling or generating of raw data with relevant information, which could be used for improving the efficacy of machine learning models. The process, however, is labor-intensive and costly. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-4, presents an unprecedented opportunity to automate the complicated process of data annotation and synthesis. While existing surveys have extensively covered LLM architecture, training, and general applications, we uniquely focus on their specific utility for data annotation. This survey contributes to three core aspects: LLM-Based Annotation Generation, LLM-Generated Annotations Assessment, and LLM-Generated Annotations Utilization. Furthermore, this survey includes an in-depth taxonomy of data types that LLMs can annotate, a comprehensive review of learning strategies for models utilizing LLM-generated annotations, and a detailed discussion of the primary challenges and limitations associated with using LLMs for data annotation and synthesis. Serving as a key guide, this survey aims to assist researchers and practitioners in exploring the potential of the latest LLMs for data annotation, thereby fostering future advancements in this critical field.

**Summary**: Evaluating the safety of AI Systems is a pressing concern for organizations deploying them. In addition to the societal damage done by the lack of fairness of those systems, deployers are concerned about the legal repercussions and the reputational damage incurred by the use of models that are unsafe. Safety covers both what a model does; e.g., can it be used to reveal personal information from its training set, and how a model was built; e.g., was it only trained on licensed data sets. Determining the safety of an AI system requires gathering information from a wide set of heterogeneous sources including safety benchmarks and technical documentation for the set of models used in that system. In addition, responsible use is encouraged through mechanisms that advise and help the user to take mitigating actions where safety risks are detected. We present Usage Governance Advisor which creates semi-structured governance information, identifies and prioritizes risks according to the intended use case, recommends appropriate benchmarks and risk assessments and importantly proposes mitigation strategies and actions.
