**Authors**: Hamza Kahlaoui, Mourad Hrizi, Abdessamad Oulmelk, Xiangcheng Zheng, Ahmed Hendy

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:18:59Z

**Summary**: Of concern is the problem of reconstructing a space-dependent potential from boundary observations in the Caputo time-fractional diffusion equation, utilizing a stable and robust recovery method. We develop an algorithm to minimize the Kohn-Vogelius (KV) cost function, which measures the difference between the solutions of two excitations. The inverse potential problem is recast into an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a Kohn-Vogelius-type functional within a set of admissible potentials. We establish the well-posedness of this optimization problem by proving the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer and demonstrating its stability with respect to perturbations in the boundary data. Furthermore, we analyze the Fr\'echet differentiability of the KV functional and prove the Lipschitz continuity of its gradient. These theoretical results enable the development of a convergent conjugate gradient algorithm for numerical reconstruction. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are confirmed through several numerical examples in both one and two dimensions, including cases with noisy data.

### CompLLM: Compression for Long Context Q&A
**Authors**: Gabriele Berton, Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Son Tran, Mubarak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:49:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.

### 3D Blocking for Matrix-free Smoothers in 2D Variable-Viscosity Stokes   Equations with Applications to Geodynamics
**Authors**: Marcel Ferrari, Cyrill PÃ¼ntener, Alexander Sotoudeh, Niklas Viebig

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:25:13Z

**Summary**: We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++ Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic. These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.

### Obelix: Mitigating Side-Channels Through Dynamic Obfuscation
**Authors**: Jan Wichelmann, Anja Rabich, Anna P"atschke, Thomas Eisenbarth

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:32:51Z

**Summary**: Trusted execution environments (TEEs) offer hardware-assisted means to protect code and data. However, as shown in numerous results over the years, attackers can use side-channels to leak data access patterns and even single-step the code. While the vendors are slowly introducing hardware-based countermeasures for some attacks, others will stay unaddressed. This makes a software-level countermeasure desirable, but current available solutions only address very specific attack vectors or have a narrow leakage model.   In this work, we take a holistic view at the vulnerabilities of TEEs and design a tool named Obelix, which is the first to protect both code and data against a wide range of TEE attacks, from cache attacks over single-stepping to ciphertext side-channels. We analyze the practically achievable precision of state-of-the-art single-stepping tools, and present an algorithm which uses that knowledge to divide a program into uniform code blocks, that are indistinguishable for a strong attacker. By storing these blocks and the program data in oblivious RAM, the attacker cannot follow execution, effectively protecting both secret code and data. We describe how we automate our approach to make it available for developers who are unfamiliar with side-channels. As an obfuscation tool, Obelix comes with a considerable performance overhead, but compensates this with strong security guarantees and easy applicability without requiring any expert knowledge.

### PDTrim: Targeted Pruning for Prefill-Decode Disaggregation in Inference
**Authors**: Hao Zhang, Mengsi Lyu, Zhuo Chen, Xingrun Xing, Yulong Ao, Yonghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T08:31:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the same (default) settings, our method achieves improved performance and faster inference, along with a 4.95$\times$ reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

### Scaling Up On-Device LLMs via Active-Weight Swapping Between DRAM and   Flash
**Authors**: Fucheng Jia, Zewen Wu, Shiqi Jiang, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianxi Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Yunxin Liu, Ju Ren, Deyu Zhang, Ting Cao

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T08:24:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

### Static Estimation of Reuse Profiles for Arrays in Nested Loops
**Authors**: Abdur Razzak, Atanu Barai, Nandakishore Santhi, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T06:10:20Z

**Summary**: Efficient memory access patterns play a crucial role in determining the overall performance of applications by exploiting temporal and spatial locality, thus maximizing cache locality. The Reuse Distance Histogram (RDH) is a widely used metric to quantify temporal locality, measuring the distance between consecutive accesses to the same memory location. Traditionally, calculating RDH requires program execution and memory trace collection to obtain dynamic memory access behavior. This trace collection is often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and unsuitable for early-stage optimization or large-scale applications. Static prediction, on the other hand, offers a significant speedup in estimating RDH and cache hit rates. However, these approaches lack accuracy, since the predictions come without running the program and knowing the complete memory access pattern, more specifically when arrays are used inside nested loops. This paper presents a novel static analysis framework for predicting the reuse profiles of array references in programs with nested loop structures, without requiring any runtime information. By analyzing loop bounds, access patterns in smaller problem sizes, and predictive equations, our method predicts access patterns of arrays and estimates reuse distances and cache hit rate at compile time. This paper extends our previous study by incorporating more analysis and improving prediction by addressing previously unhandled reuse patterns. We evaluate our technique against a widely accepted traditional trace-driven profiling tool, Parallel Reuse Distance Analysis (PARDA). The results demonstrate that our static predictor achieves comparable accuracy while offering orders-of-magnitude improvement in the analysis speed. This work offers a practical alternative to dynamic reuse profiling and paves the way for integration into compilers and static performance modeling tools.

### CALL: Context-Aware Low-Latency Retrieval in Disk-Based Vector Databases
**Authors**: Yeonwoo Jeong, Hyunji Cho, Kyuri Park, Youngjae Kim, Sungyong Park

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T05:39:47Z

**Summary**: Embedding models capture both semantic and syntactic structures of queries, often mapping different queries to similar regions in vector space. This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in modern disk-based vector databases. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight increases cache miss penalty. To minimize the cache miss penalty, we propose CALL, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, CALL incorporates a group-aware prefetching method to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups and latency-aware cluster loading. Experimental results show that CALL reduces the 99th percentile tail latency by up to 33% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio, substantially reducing search latency.

### VLN-Zero: Rapid Exploration and Cache-Enabled Neurosymbolic   Vision-Language Planning for Zero-Shot Transfer in Robot Navigation
**Authors**: Neel P. Bhatt, Yunhao Yang, Rohan Siva, Pranay Samineni, Daniel Milan, Zhangyang Wang, Ufuk Topcu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T03:23:03Z

**Summary**: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments. Codebase, datasets, and videos for VLN-Zero are available at: https://vln-zero.github.io/.

### DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Guangyu Wang, Junfan Li, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T01:58:07Z

**Summary**: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

### Foresight: Adaptive Layer Reuse for Accelerated and High-Quality   Text-to-Video Generation
**Authors**: Muhammad Adnan, Nithesh Kurella, Akhil Arunkumar, Prashant J. Nair

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T19:20:33Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.   We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to \latencyimprv end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \href{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}.

### Speculate Deep and Accurate: Lossless and Training-Free Acceleration for   Offloaded LLMs via Substitute Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Pei-Shuo Wang, Jian-Jia Chen, Chun-Che Yang, Chi-Chih Chang, Ning-Chi Huang, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T19:08:57Z

**Summary**: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

**Authors**: Sudam Masanta, Gurvinder Singh, Shefali Pahwa, Shekhar Dwivedi, Devaraju Sampathirao, Ramandeep Singh

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T18:32:32Z

**Summary**: Introduction: This study uses KV CBCT based Synthetic CT (sCT) generated through Velocity workstation and compare the target and normal tissue doses with Adaptive plan CT doses.   Methods: Thirty head and neck cancer patients undergoing Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) were included in this retrospective study. Initially, patient underwent treatment with the primary plan. After subsequent indications of major changes in patients' physicality and anatomy adaptive CT scans were acquired as per institutional protocol. Both the primary planning CT and the indicative cone-beam CT (CBCT) last acquired before the commencement of the adaptive treatment were imported into Velocity workstation. Rigid and deformable image registration techniques were used for the generation of a Synthetic CT (sCT). Simultaneously replanning was done on re-planning CT (rCT) for adaptive plan execution. The primary plan dose was subsequently mapped and deformed onto the Synthetic CT in Velocity workstation, allowing for a comparative dosimetric analysis between the sCT and rCT plan doses. This comparison was conducted in both Velocity and Eclipse, focusing on dose variations across different organs at risk (OARs) and the planning target volume (PTV). Additionally, dosimetric indices were evaluated to assess and validate the accuracy and quality of the synthetic CT-based dose mapping relative to adaptive planning.   Results: The dosimetric comparison between sCT and rCT stated that Mean dose for OARs and PTVs were found to be similar in the two planning and the level of confidence by using T-statistics. Collaborative research has the potential to eliminate the need of rCT as a standard requirement.   Conclusion: The sCT shows comparable CT numbers and doses to the replanning CT, suggesting it's potential as a replacement pending clinical correlation and contour adjustments.

### Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative   Decoding
**Authors**: Sudhanshu Agrawal, Risheek Garrepalli, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Christopher Lott, Fatih Porikli

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T17:58:21Z

**Summary**: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.

### Attention Sinks: A 'Catch, Tag, Release' Mechanism for Embeddings
**Authors**: Stephen Zhang, Mustafa Khan, Vardan Papyan

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T16:16:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often concentrate their attention on a few specific tokens referred to as attention sinks. Common examples include the first token, a prompt-independent sink, and punctuation tokens, which are prompt-dependent. While the tokens causing the sinks often lack direct semantic meaning, the presence of the sinks is critical for model performance, particularly under model compression and KV-caching. Despite their ubiquity, the function, semantic role, and origin of attention sinks -- especially those beyond the first token -- remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation demonstrating that attention sinks: catch a sequence of tokens, tag them using a common direction in embedding space, and release them back into the residual stream, where tokens are later retrieved based on the tags they have acquired. Probing experiments reveal these tags carry semantically meaningful information, such as the truth of a statement. These findings extend to reasoning models, where the mechanism spans more heads and explains greater variance in embeddings, or recent models with query-key normalization, where sinks remain just as prevalent. To encourage future theoretical analysis, we introduce a minimal problem which can be solved through the 'catch, tag, release' mechanism, and where it emerges through training.

### Efficient Beam Search for Large Language Models Using Trie-Based   Decoding
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, MaoXun Huang, Jui-Hung Cheng, Chao-Ting Chen, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T12:28:41Z

**Summary**: This work presents a novel trie (prefix-tree)-based parallel decoding method that addresses the memory inefficiency of batch-based beam search. By sharing a single KV cache across beams with common prefixes, our approach dramatically reduces memory usage and enables efficient decoding. We evaluated our method across three attention architectures, Multi-Head Attention (Phi-3.5-mini-instruct), Grouped Query Attention (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), and Sliding Window Attention (Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501), using CNN/DailyMail for abstractive summarization and HumanEval for code generation. Our experiments demonstrate substantial memory savings (4--8$\times$) and up to 2.4$\times$ faster decoding, without compromising generation quality. These results highlight our method's suitability for memory-constrained environments and large-scale deployments.

### Neural Attention Search
**Authors**: Difan Deng, Marius Lindauer

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T12:03:22Z

**Summary**: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

### Evict3R: Training-Free Token Eviction for Memory-Bounded Streaming   Visual Geometry Transformers
**Authors**: Soroush Mahdi, Fardin Ayar, Ehsan Javanmardi, Manabu Tsukada, Mahdi Javanmardi

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T11:54:58Z

**Summary**: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from 18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming inference more practical.

### EpiCache: Episodic KV Cache Management for Long Conversational Question   Answering
**Authors**: Minsoo Kim, Arnav Kundu, Han-Byul Kim, Richa Dixit, Minsik Cho

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T06:56:35Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have extended context lengths, enabling assistants to sustain long histories for coherent, personalized responses. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV) caching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly dominates under strict resource constraints. An active line of research for reducing this overhead is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while preserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i) evicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and (ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to degraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a training-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth through block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV compression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and applies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to eviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across three LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40% over recent baselines, sustains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and reduces latency and memory by up to 2.4x and 3.5x, thereby enabling efficient multi-turn interaction under strict resource constraints.

### Prefetching in Deep Memory Hierarchies with NVRAM as Main Memory
**Authors**: Manel Lurbe, Miguel Avargues, Salvador Petit, Maria E. Gomez, Rui Yang, Guanhao Wang, Julio Sahuquillo

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T06:52:35Z

**Summary**: Emerging applications, such as big data analytics and machine learning, require increasingly large amounts of main memory, often exceeding the capacity of current commodity processors built on DRAM technology. To address this, recent research has focused on off-chip memory controllers that facilitate access to diverse memory media, each with unique density and latency characteristics. While these solutions improve memory system performance, they also exacerbate the already significant memory latency. As a result, multi-level prefetching techniques are essential to mitigate these extended latencies.   This paper investigates the advantages of prefetching across both sides of the memory system: the off-chip memory and the on-chip cache hierarchy. Our primary objective is to assess the impact of a multi-level prefetching engine on overall system performance. Additionally, we analyze the individual contribution of each prefetching level to system efficiency. To achieve this, the study evaluates two key prefetching approaches: HMC (Hybrid Memory Controller) and HMC+L1, both of which employ prefetching mechanisms commonly used by processor vendors. The HMC approach integrates a prefetcher within the off-chip hybrid memory controller, while the HMC+L1 approach combines this with additional L1 on-chip prefetchers.   Experimental results on an out-of-order execution processor show that on-chip cache prefetchers are crucial for maximizing the benefits of off-chip prefetching, which in turn further enhances performance. Specifically, the off-chip HMC prefetcher achieves coverage and accuracy rates exceeding 60% and up to 80%, while the combined HMC+L1 approach boosts off-chip prefetcher coverage to as much as 92%. Consequently, overall performance increases from 9% with the HMC approach to 12% when L1 prefetching is also employed.

### Robustifying Learning-Augmented Caching Efficiently without Compromising   1-Consistency
**Authors**: Peng Chen, Hailiang Zhao, Jiaji Zhang, Xueyan Tang, Yixuan Wang, Shuiguang Deng

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T06:35:26Z

**Summary**: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

### Asteria: Semantic-Aware Cross-Region Caching for Agentic LLM Tool Access
**Authors**: Chaoyi Ruan, Chao Bi, Kaiwen Zheng, Ziji Shi, Xinyi Wan, Jialin Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-22T05:24:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse.   To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Asteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\times$ increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Asteria also improves throughput for complex coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.

### On efficient block Krylov-solvers for $\mathcal H^2$-matrices
**Authors**: Sven Christophersen

**Updated**: 2025-09-21T22:14:56Z

**Summary**: Hierarchical matrices provide a highly memory-efficient way of storing dense linear operators arising, for example, from boundary element methods, particularly when stored in the H^2 format. In such data-sparse representations, iterative solvers are preferred over direct ones due to the cost-efficient matrix-vector multiplications they enable. Solving multiple systems of linear equations with the same hierarchical matrix naturally leads to block methods, which in turn make heavy use of BLAS level-3 functions such as GEMM. We present an efficient implementation of H^2-matrix-vector and H^2-matrix-matrix multiplication that fully exploits the potential of modern hardware in terms of memory and cache utilization. The latter is employed to accelerate block Krylov subspace methods, which we present later as the main results of this paper.

### MoEs Are Stronger than You Think: Hyper-Parallel Inference Scaling with   RoE
**Authors**: Soheil Zibakhsh, Mohammad Samragh, Kumari Nishu, Lauren Hannah, Arnav Kundu, Minsik Cho

**Updated**: 2025-09-21T21:05:29Z

**Summary**: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.

### Fast ECoT: Efficient Embodied Chain-of-Thought via Thoughts Reuse
**Authors**: Zhekai Duan, Yuan Zhang, Shikai Geng, Gaowen Liu, Joschka Boedecker, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu

**Updated**: 2025-09-21T11:48:15Z

**Summary**: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (ECoT) reasoning enhances vision-language-action (VLA) models by improving performance and interpretability through intermediate reasoning steps. However, its sequential autoregressive token generation introduces significant inference latency, limiting real-time deployment. We propose Fast ECoT, an inference-time acceleration method that exploits the structured and repetitive nature of ECoT to (1) cache and reuse high-level reasoning across timesteps and (2) parallelise the generation of modular reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous scheduler that decouples reasoning from action decoding, further boosting responsiveness. Fast ECoT requires no model changes or additional training and integrates easily into existing VLA pipelines. Experiments in both simulation (LIBERO) and real-world robot tasks show up to a 7.5% reduction in latency with comparable or improved task success rate and reasoning faithfulness, bringing ECoT policies closer to practical real-time deployment.

### FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Junbin Kang, Mingkai Dong, Mingyu Liu, Lu Zhang, Shaohong Guo, Ziyan Qiu, Mingzhen You, Ziyi Tian, Anqi Yu, Tianhong Ding, Xinwei Hu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-21T07:03:46Z

**Summary**: Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year.

### SpecVLM: Fast Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Haiduo Huang, Fuwei Yang, Zhenhua Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Pengju Ren, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-09-21T03:35:36Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available at https://github.com/haiduo/SpecVLM.

### ShadowServe: Interference-Free KV Cache Fetching for Distributed Prefix   Caching
**Authors**: Xingyu Xiang, Raj Joshi, Yuhan Liu, Jiayi Yao, Chenxingyu Zhao, Junchen Jiang, Yang Zhou, Eddie Kohler, Minlan Yu

**Updated**: 2025-09-21T00:59:45Z

**Summary**: Distributed prefix caching accelerates long-context LLM serving by reusing KV cache entries for common context prefixes. However, KV cache fetches can become a bottleneck when network bandwidth is limited. Compression mitigates the bandwidth issue, but can degrade overall performance when decompression interferes with model computation.   We present ShadowServe, the first SmartNIC-accelerated, interference-free prefix caching system for LLM serving. ShadowServe separates a control plane on the host and a data plane fully offloaded to the SmartNIC, which eliminates interference to both host GPU and CPU. To overcome the SmartNIC's limited compute and memory resources, we design a chunked pipeline that parallelizes data plane operations across the SmartNIC's compute resources, and a minimal-copy memory management scheme that reduces memory pressure on the SmartNIC. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, ShadowServe achieves up to 2.2x lower loaded time-per-output-token (TPOT), and reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 1.38x in low-bandwidth scenarios (<= 20 Gbps), translating to up to 1.35x higher throughput.

### MPIC: Position-Independent Multimodal Context Caching System for   Efficient MLLM Serving
**Authors**: Shiju Zhao, Junhao Hu, Rongxiao Huang, Jiaqi Zheng, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-20T13:54:37Z

**Summary**: The context caching technique is employed to accelerate the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) inference by prevailing serving platforms currently. However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated the integrated reuse and recompute mechanism within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54\% reduction in response time and 2$\times$ improvement in throughput compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.

### EG-MLA: Embedding-Gated Multi-head Latent Attention for Scalable and   Efficient LLMs
**Authors**: Zhengge Cai, Haowen Hou

**Updated**: 2025-09-20T13:27:13Z

**Summary**: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache size is a crucial step toward enabling efficient inference in large language models (LLMs), especially under latency and memory constraints. While Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers strong representational power, it incurs significant memory overhead. Recent work on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) mitigates this by compressing KV representations into a shared latent space, achieving a better trade-off between performance and cache efficiency. While MLA already achieves significant KV cache reduction, the scope for further compression remains limited without performance loss. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Embedding-Gated Multi-head Latent Attention (EG-MLA)}, a novel extension of MLA that further reduces KV cache size while enhancing representational expressiveness. EG-MLA introduces a token-specific embedding gating mechanism applied in the latent space, enabling fine-grained modulation of compressed KV vectors with minimal additional computation. Compared to MHA, EG-MLA achieves over 91.6\% reduction in KV cache size with negligible performance degradation. Relative to MLA, EG-MLA consistently improves task accuracy across diverse reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 59.9\% additional memory savings. Our theoretical analysis highlights how embedding gating induces implicit high-order interactions, and empirical evaluations demonstrate robust generalization across model scales and compression regimes. Notably, we successfully scale EG-MLA to over 1 billion parameters, demonstrating its practical viability for large-scale LLM deployment. These results establish EG-MLA as a memory- and compute-efficient attention mechanism that enables scalable, high-performance inference in modern LLMs.

### Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster: Towards Efficient, Fine-Controllable, and   Expressive Freestyle Portrait Animation
**Authors**: Yue Ma, Zexuan Yan, Hongyu Liu, Hongfa Wang, Heng Pan, Yingqing He, Junkun Yuan, Ailing Zeng, Chengfei Cai, Heung-Yeung Shum, Zhifeng Li, Wei Liu, Linfeng Zhang, Qifeng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-20T11:09:01Z

**Summary**: We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait, accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse portraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences. Extensive evaluations on EmojiBench++ demonstrate that Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster achieves superior performance in both animation quality and controllability. The code, training dataset and benchmark will be found in https://follow-your-emoji.github.io/.

### Shift Parallelism: Low-Latency, High-Throughput LLM Inference for   Dynamic Workloads
**Authors**: Mert Hidayetoglu, Aurick Qiao, Michael Wyatt, Jeff Rasley, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari

**Updated**: 2025-09-20T01:56:25Z

**Summary**: Efficient parallelism is necessary for achieving low-latency, high-throughput inference with large language models (LLMs). Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms.   We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism.   Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution.   We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.

### From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to   Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes
**Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T23:46:08Z

**Summary**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of <10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts

### WarpSpeed: A High-Performance Library for Concurrent GPU Hash Tables
**Authors**: Hunter McCoy, Prashant Pandey

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T20:31:38Z

**Summary**: GPU hash tables are increasingly used to accelerate data processing, but their limited functionality restricts adoption in large-scale data processing applications. Current limitations include incomplete concurrency support and missing compound operations such as upserts.   This paper presents WarpSpeed, a library of high-performance concurrent GPU hash tables with a unified benchmarking framework for performance analysis. WarpSpeed implements eight state-of-the-art Nvidia GPU hash table designs and provides a rich API designed for modern GPU applications. Our evaluation uses diverse benchmarks to assess both correctness and scalability, and we demonstrate real-world impact by integrating these hash tables into three downstream applications.   We propose several optimization techniques to reduce concurrency overhead, including fingerprint-based metadata to minimize cache line probes and specialized Nvidia GPU instructions for lock-free queries. Our findings provide new insights into concurrent GPU hash table design and offer practical guidance for developing efficient, scalable data structures on modern GPUs.

### Cache-of-Thought: Master-Apprentice Framework for Cost-Effective Vision   Language Model Reasoning
**Authors**: Mingyuan Wu, Jize Jiang, Haozhen Zheng, Meitang Li, Zhaoheng Li, Beitong Tian, Bo Chen, Yongjoo Park, Minjia Zhang, Chengxiang Zhai, Klara Nahrstedt

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T17:18:26Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of vision applications of increasing complexity and scales, yet choosing the right VLM model size involves a trade-off between response quality and cost. While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU.   In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general reasoning benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall reasoning performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%.

### KVCompose: Efficient Structured KV Cache Compression with Composite   Tokens
**Authors**: Dmitry Akulov, Mohamed Sana, Antonio De Domenico, Tareq Si Salem, Nicola Piovesan, Fadhel Ayed

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T15:19:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute kernels.   We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

**Summary**: Minibeam and microbeam radiation therapy promise improved treatment outcomes through reduced normal tissue toxicity at better tumor control rates. The lack of suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of minibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We developed the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with technology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and microbeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with the LFXT prototype. The LFXT was high voltage conditioned up to 300 kV.The focal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable side effects after whole-brain 260 $\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical setting.

### UniGist: Towards General and Hardware-aligned Sequence-level Long   Context Compression
**Authors**: Chenlong Deng, Zhisong Zhang, Kelong Mao, Shuaiyi Li, Tianqing Fang, Hongming Zhang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T08:47:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models are increasingly capable of handling long-context inputs, but the memory overhead of key-value (KV) cache remains a major bottleneck for general-purpose deployment. While various compression strategies have been explored, sequence-level compression, which drops the full KV caches for certain tokens, is particularly challenging as it can lead to the loss of important contextual information. To address this, we introduce UniGist, a sequence-level long-context compression framework that efficiently preserves context information by replacing raw tokens with special compression tokens (gists) in a fine-grained manner. We adopt a chunk-free training strategy and design an efficient kernel with a gist shift trick, enabling optimized GPU training. Our scheme also supports flexible inference by allowing the actual removal of compressed tokens, resulting in real-time memory savings. Experiments across multiple long-context tasks demonstrate that UniGist significantly improves compression quality, with especially strong performance in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.

### CARD: A Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding Framework via   Query-and-Correct Paradigm for Accelerating LLM Inference
**Authors**: Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T06:20:14Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where a draft model provides multiple candidate tokens for the target model to verify in parallel, has demonstrated significant potential for accelerating LLM inference. Yet, existing SD approaches adhere to a strict draft-then-verify paradigm, enforcing a sequential process that hampers performance and constrains the draft model's capacity. Moreover, rejecting a token in the candidate sequence invalidates all subsequent tokens, leading to wasted computation during drafting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a cache-assisted parallel speculative decoding framework called CARD, which employs a novel query-and-correct paradigm. Our approach decouples drafting from verification: the draft model populates a shared cache with candidate tokens, while the target model concurrently refines the draft's trajectory. This enables inference at near-draft-speed, effectively leveraging the draft model's efficiency without additional fine-tuning. Experimental results show that CARD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 4.83x acceleration over vanilla autoregressive decoding, with no fine-tuning required for either models.

### Optimization techniques for SQL+ML queries: A performance analysis of   real-time feature computation in OpenMLDB
**Authors**: Mashkhal A. Sidiq, Aras A. Salih, Samrand M. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T02:27:01Z

**Summary**: In this study, we optimize SQL+ML queries on top of OpenMLDB, an open-source database that seamlessly integrates offline and online feature computations. The work used feature-rich synthetic dataset experiments in Docker, which acted like production environments that processed 100 to 500 records per batch and 6 to 12 requests per batch in parallel. Efforts have been concentrated in the areas of better query plans, cached execution plans, parallel processing, and resource management. The experimental results show that OpenMLDB can support approximately 12,500 QPS with less than 1 ms latency, outperforming SparkSQL and ClickHouse by a factor of 23 and PostgreSQL and MySQL by 3.57 times. This study assessed the impact of optimization and showed that query plan optimization accounted for 35% of the performance gains, caching for 25%, and parallel processing for 20%. These results illustrate OpenMLDB's capability for time-sensitive ML use cases, such as fraud detection, personalized recommendation, and time series forecasting. The system's modular optimization framework, which combines batch and stream processing without interference, contributes to its significant performance gain over traditional database systems, particularly in applications that require real-time feature computation and serving. This study contributes to the understanding and design of high-performance SQL+ML systems and highlights the need for specialized SQL optimization for ML workloads.

### LLM Cache Bandit Revisited: Addressing Query Heterogeneity for   Cost-Effective LLM Inference
**Authors**: Hantao Yang, Hong Xie, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-19T01:39:08Z

**Summary**: This paper revisits the LLM cache bandit problem, with a special focus on addressing the query heterogeneity for cost-effective LLM inference. Previous works often assume uniform query sizes. Heterogeneous query sizes introduce a combinatorial structure for cache selection, making the cache replacement process more computationally and statistically challenging. We treat optimal cache selection as a knapsack problem and employ an accumulation-based strategy to effectively balance computational overhead and cache updates. In theoretical analysis, we prove that the regret of our algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{MNT})$ bound, improving the coefficient of $\sqrt{MN}$ compared to the $O(MN\sqrt{T})$ result in Berkeley, where $N$ is the total number of queries and $M$ is the cache size. Additionally, we also provide a problem-dependent bound, which was absent in previous works. The experiment rely on real-world data show that our algorithm reduces the total cost by approximately 12\%.

**Summary**: A critical element in the realization of large liquid and gas time projection chambers (TPCs) is the delivery and distribution of high voltages into and around the detector. Such experiments require of order tens of kilovolts to enable electron drift over meter-scale distances. This paper describes the design and operation of the cathode feedthrough and high voltage distribution through the field cage of the NEXT-100 experiment, an underground TPC that will search for neutrinoless double beta decay $0\nu\beta\beta$. The feedthrough has been demonstrated to hold pressures up to 20~bar and sustain voltages as high as -65~kV, and the TPC is operating stably at its design high voltages. The system has been realized within the constraints of a stringent radiopurity budget and is now being used to execute a suite of sensitive double beta decay analyses.

### Language Modeling with Learned Meta-Tokens
**Authors**: Alok N. Shah, Khush Gupta, Keshav Ramji, Pratik Chaudhari

**Updated**: 2025-09-18T17:38:48Z

**Summary**: While modern Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved major success in multi-task generalization, they often struggle to capture long-range dependencies within their context window. This work introduces a novel approach using meta-tokens, special tokens injected during pre-training, along with a dedicated meta-attention mechanism to guide LMs to use these tokens. We pre-train a language model with a modified GPT-2 architecture equipped with meta-attention in addition to causal multi-head attention, and study the impact of these tokens on a suite of synthetic tasks. We find that data-efficient language model pre-training on fewer than 100B tokens utilizing meta-tokens and our meta-attention mechanism achieves strong performance on these tasks after fine-tuning. We suggest that these gains arise due to the meta-tokens sharpening the positional encoding. This enables them to operate as trainable, content-based landmarks, implicitly compressing preceding context and "caching" it in the meta-token. At inference-time, the meta-token points to relevant context, facilitating length generalization up to 2$\times$ its context window, even after extension with YaRN. We provide further evidence of these behaviors by visualizing model internals to study the residual stream, and assessing the compression quality by information-theoretic analysis on the rate-distortion tradeoff. Our findings suggest that pre-training LMs with meta-tokens offers a simple, data-efficient method to enhance long-context language modeling performance, while introducing new insights into the nature of their behavior towards length generalization.

### Value-Guided KV Compression for LLMs via Approximated CUR Decomposition
**Authors**: Ayan Sengupta, Siddhant Chaudhary, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2025-09-18T15:04:06Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) cache compression has emerged as a critical technique for reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention scores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output. In this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss. Empirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation latency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff.

### Attention Beyond Neighborhoods: Reviving Transformer for Graph   Clustering
**Authors**: Xuanting Xie, Bingheng Li, Erlin Pan, Rui Hou, Wenyu Chen, Zhao Kang

**Updated**: 2025-09-18T14:51:13Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks, driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### BWCache: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers through Block-Wise   Caching
**Authors**: Hanshuai Cui, Zhiqing Tang, Zhifei Xu, Zhi Yao, Wenyi Zeng, Weijia Jia

**Updated**: 2025-09-18T04:57:32Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

### Kilovolt-Class $Î²-Ga_2O_3$ Field-Plated Schottky Barrier Diodes with   MOCVD-Grown Intentionally $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ Doped Drift Layers
**Authors**: Carl Peterson, Chinmoy Nath Saha, Rachel Kahler, Yizheng Liu, Akhila Mattapalli, Saurav Roy, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T20:08:53Z

**Summary**: We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\mu m$ thick via MOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier diodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010) $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth parameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for high quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure was found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples. Growth rates of up to 7.2 $\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\mu m$, Hall mobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID concentrations as low as $2 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable intentional doping down to $3 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field plated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\mu m$ thick film to determine the electrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to have current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific differential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn on voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode metal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity. Diodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through maximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art result for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.

### On the Illusion of Success: An Empirical Study of Build Reruns and   Silent Failures in Industrial CI
**Authors**: Henri AÃ¯dasso, Francis Bordeleau, Ali Tizghadam

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T18:26:29Z

**Summary**: Reliability of build outcomes is a cornerstone of effective Continuous Integration (CI). Yet in practice, developers often struggle with non-deterministic issues in the code or CI infrastructure, which undermine trust in build results. When faced with such unexpected outcomes, developers often repeatedly rerun jobs hoping for true success, but this practice is known to increase CI costs and reduce productivity. While recent studies have focused on intermittent job failures, no prior work has investigated silent failures, where build jobs are marked as successful but fail to complete all or part of their tasks. Such silent failures often go unnoticed, creating an illusion of success with detrimental consequences such as bugs escaping into production. This paper presents the first empirical study of silent failures through the practice of rerunning successful jobs. An analysis of 142,387 jobs across 81 industrial projects shows that 11% of successful jobs are rerun, with 35% of these reruns occurring after more than 24 hours. Using mixed-effects models on 32 independent variables (AUC of 85%), we identified key factors associated with reruns of successful jobs, notably testing and static analysis tasks, scripting languages like Shell, and developers prior rerun tendencies. A further analysis of 92 public issues revealed 11 categories of silent failures aligning with these factors, the most frequent being artifact operation errors, caching errors, and ignored exit codes. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the circumstances and causes of silent failures to raise awareness among teams, and present solutions to improve CI reliability.

### Reasoning Efficiently Through Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression: A   Self-Optimizing Framework
**Authors**: Kerui Huang, Shuhan Liu, Xing Hu, Tongtong Xu, Lingfeng Bao, Xin Xia

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T15:33:44Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by prompting intermediate steps, improving accuracy and robustness in arithmetic, logic, and commonsense tasks. However, this benefit comes with high computational costs: longer outputs increase latency, memory usage, and KV-cache demands. These issues are especially critical in software engineering tasks where concise and deterministic outputs are required. To investigate these trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation benchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help. Excessive reasoning often causes truncation, accuracy drops, and latency up to five times higher, with failed outputs consistently longer than successful ones. These findings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning is inherently better and highlight the need for adaptive CoT control. Motivated by this, we propose SEER (Self-Enhancing Efficient Reasoning), an adaptive framework that compresses CoT while preserving accuracy. SEER combines Best-of-N sampling with task-aware adaptive filtering, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on pre-inference outputs to reduce verbosity and computational overhead. We then evaluate SEER on three software engineering tasks and one math task. On average, SEER shortens CoT by 42.1%, improves accuracy by reducing truncation, and eliminates most infinite loops. These results demonstrate SEER as a practical method to make CoT-enhanced LLMs more efficient and robust, even under resource constraints.

### A TRRIP Down Memory Lane: Temperature-Based Re-Reference Interval   Prediction For Instruction Caching
**Authors**: Henry Kao, Nikhil Sreekumar, Prabhdeep Singh Soni, Ali Sedaghati, Fang Su, Bryan Chan, Maziar Goudarzi, Reza Azimi

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T14:42:38Z

**Summary**: Modern mobile CPU software pose challenges for conventional instruction cache replacement policies due to their complex runtime behavior causing high reuse distance between executions of the same instruction. Mobile code commonly suffers from large amounts of stalls in the CPU frontend and thus starvation of the rest of the CPU resources. Complexity of these applications and their code footprint are projected to grow at a rate faster than available on-chip memory due to power and area constraints, making conventional hardware-centric methods for managing instruction caches to be inadequate. We present a novel software-hardware co-design approach called TRRIP (Temperature-based Re-Reference Interval Prediction) that enables the compiler to analyze, classify, and transform code based on "temperature" (hot/cold), and to provide the hardware with a summary of code temperature information through a well-defined OS interface based on using code page attributes. TRRIP's lightweight hardware extension employs code temperature attributes to optimize the instruction cache replacement policy resulting in the eviction rate reduction of hot code. TRRIP is designed to be practical and adoptable in real mobile systems that have strict feature requirements on both the software and hardware components. TRRIP can reduce the L2 MPKI for instructions by 26.5% resulting in geomean speedup of 3.9%, on top of RRIP cache replacement running mobile code already optimized using PGO.

### SBVR: Summation of BitVector Representation for Efficient LLM   Quantization
**Authors**: Wonjun Bang, Jongseok Park, Hongseung Yu, Kyungmin Bin, Kyunghan Lee

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T13:51:27Z

**Summary**: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data. Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest (RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR (Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression. Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization regime.

### SpecDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Self-Speculation
**Authors**: Jiayi Pan, Jiaming Xu, Yongkang Zhou, Guohao Dai

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T09:24:40Z

**Summary**: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.

### A Framework for Multi-source Prefetching Through Adaptive Weight
**Authors**: Yoseph Berhanu Alebachew, Mulugeta Libsie

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T00:28:49Z

**Summary**: The World Wide Web has come to be a great part of our daily life, yet user observed latency is still a problem that needs a proper means of handling. Even though earlier attempts focused on caching as the chief solution to tackling this issue, its success was extremely limited. Prefetching has come to be the primary technique in supplementing caching towards soothing the latency problem associated with the contemporary Internet. However, existing approaches in prefetching are extremely limited in their ability to employ application level web document relationship which is often visible only to the content developer. This is because most approaches are access history based schemes that make future users' access prediction only based on past user access. Attempts to incorporate prefetching schemes that utilize semantic information with those that use users past access history are extremely limited in their extensibility. In this work we present a novel framework that enables integration of schemes from both worlds of prefetching without the need for a major modification to the algorithms. When there is a need/possibility to capture new application level context, a new algorithm could be developed to do so and then it can be integrated into the framework. Since each participating scheme is merely viewed as an algorithm that produces a list of candidate objects that are likely to be accessed in the near future, the framework can entertain any one of the existing prefetching schemes. With its adaptive weight management technique the framework adjusts the effect of each algorithm in the overall prediction to parallel with its observed performance so far. We have found this formwork to be less aggressive than its contemporary counterparts which is extremely important for resource constrained mobile devices that have come to be the major means of access by users of the current web.

### Bridging Cache-Friendliness and Concurrency: A Locality-Optimized   In-Memory B-Skiplist
**Authors**: Yicong Luo, Senhe Hao, Brian Wheatman, Prashant Pandey, Helen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T23:56:55Z

**Summary**: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores, such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential. In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128 threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations, including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between 3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between 0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads with inserts.

### FIER: Fine-Grained and Efficient KV Cache Retrieval for Long-context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Dongwei Wang, Zijie Liu, Song Wang, Yuxin Ren, Jianing Deng, Jingtong Hu, Tianlong Chen, Huanrui Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T23:15:44Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a \underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache \underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval. Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by 1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.Code is available at https://github.com/SimWangArizona/FIER

### InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via   ICL-oriented Prefix Caching
**Authors**: Yilun Wang, Pengfei Chen, Haiyu Huang, Zilong He, Gou Tan, Chuanfu Zhang, Jingkai He, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:33:29Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.   In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.

### Topology and Fragility of European High-Voltage Networks: A   Cross-Country Comparative Analysis
**Authors**: BÃ¡lint Hartmann, Michelle T. Cirunay

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:54:58Z

**Summary**: Reliable electricity supply depends on the seamless operation of high-voltage grid infrastructure spanning both transmission and sub-transmission levels. Beneath this apparent uniformity lies a striking structural diversity, which leaves a clear imprint on system vulnerability. In this paper, we present harmonized topological models of the high-voltage grids of 15 European countries, integrating all elements at voltage levels above 110 kV. Topological analysis of these networks reveals a simple yet robust pattern: node degree distributions consistently follow an exponential decay, but the rate of decay varies significantly across countries. Through a detailed and systematic evaluation of network tolerance to node and edge removals, we show that the decay rate delineates the boundary between systems that are more resilient to failures and those that are prone to large-scale disruptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this numerical boundary is highly sensitive to which layers of the infrastructure are included in the models. To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative cross-country comparison of 15 European high-voltage networks, linking topological properties with vulnerability characteristics.

### Tool-R1: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Agentic Tool Use
**Authors**: Yabo Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Qingyun Li, Zhen Hu, Kavin Han, Wangmeng Zuo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:22:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

### SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear   Attention
**Authors**: Yuan Cao, Dong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T08:36:05Z

**Summary**: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$ to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly, which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps, contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency and model effectiveness.

### Adaptive K-PackCache: Cost-Centric Data Caching in Cloud
**Authors**: Suvarthi Sarkar, Aadarshraj Sah, Poddutoori Sweeya Reddy, Aryabartta Sahu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T07:49:41Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in data analytics have enabled the accurate prediction of user access patterns, giving rise to the idea of packed caching delivering multiple co accessed data items together as a bundle. This improves caching efficiency, as accessing one item often implies the need for others. Prior work has explored only 2 item pairwise packing. In this paper, we extend the concept to general K packing, allowing variable size bundles for improved flexibility and performance. We formulate the K PackCache problem from a content delivery network CDN operator perspective, aiming to minimize total cost comprising two components: transfer cost modeled as a base cost plus a linearly increasing term with the number of items packed, and memory rental cost for caching, which depends on how long and how much is stored. Overpacking increases cost due to low utility, underpacking leads to missed sharing opportunities. We propose an online algorithm, Adaptive K PackCache AKPC, which dynamically forms, merges, and splits data cliques based on user access patterns and content correlation. Our approach supports batch requests, enables approximate clique merging, and offers a formal competitive guarantee. Through extensive evaluation on the Netflix and Spotify datasets, AKPC reduces total cost by up to 63 and 55 percentage over online baselines, respectively, and achieves performance within 15 and 13 percentage of the optimal. This demonstrates its scalability and effectiveness for real world caching systems.

### Accelerating LLM Inference via Dynamic KV Cache Placement in   Heterogeneous Memory System
**Authors**: Yunhua Fang, Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Kaoutar El Maghraoui, Naigang Wang, Meng Wang, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T14:40:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

### SpeCa: Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Speculative Feature   Caching
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Fei Ren, Shaobo Wang, Kaixin Li, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T06:46:22Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios. Our codes have been released in Github: \textbf{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion}

### LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous   Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kang He, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T01:15:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

### FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for   Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving
**Authors**: Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Jimyoung Son, Jieun Choi, Daseul Bae, Daehyeon Baek, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Hyojung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T00:51:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models (LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron-Based Relay Node Selection for Next-Generation   Intelligent Delay-Tolerant Networks
**Authors**: Zhekun Huang, Milena Radenkovic

**Updated**: 2025-09-14T12:29:49Z

**Summary**: Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are critical for emergency communication in highly dynamic and challenging scenarios characterized by intermittent connectivity, frequent disruptions, and unpredictable node mobility. While some protocols are widely adopted for simplicity and low overhead, their static replication strategy lacks the ability to adaptively distinguish high-quality relay nodes, often leading to inefficient and suboptimal message dissemination. To address this challenge, we propose a novel intelligent routing enhancement that integrates machine learning-based node evaluation into the Spray and Wait framework. Several dynamic, core features are extracted from simulation logs and are used to train multiple classifiers - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) - to predict whether a node is suitable as a relay under dynamic conditions. The trained models are deployed via a lightweight Flask-based RESTful API, enabling real-time, adaptive predictions. We implement the enhanced router MLPBasedSprayRouter, which selectively forwards messages based on the predicted relay quality. A caching mechanism is incorporated to reduce computational overhead and ensure stable, low-latency inference. Extensive experiments under realistic emergency mobility scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves delivery ratio while reducing average latency compared to the baseline protocols. Among all evaluated classifiers, MLP achieved the most robust performance, consistently outperforming both SVM and RF in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and inference speed. These results confirm the novelty and practicality of integrating machine learning into DTN routing, paving the way for resilient and intelligent communication systems in smart cities, disaster recovery, and other dynamic environments.

### Dislocation response to electric fields in strontium titanate: A   mesoscale indentation study
**Authors**: Alexander Frisch, Daniel Isaia, Oliver PreuÃ, Xufei Fang

**Updated**: 2025-09-14T09:26:44Z

**Summary**: Dislocations in perovskite oxides have drawn increasing research interest due to their potential of tuning functional properties of electroceramics. Open questions remain regarding the behavior of dislocations concerning their stability under strong externally applied electric fields. In this study, we investigate the dielectric breakdown strength of nominally undoped SrTiO3 crystals after the introduction of high-density dislocations. The dislocation-rich samples are prepared using the Brinell scratching method, and they consistently exhibit lower dielectric breakdown strength as well as a larger scatter in the breakdown probability. We also study the impact of electric field on the introduction and movement of dislocations in SrTiO3 crystals using Brinell indentation coupled with an electric field of 2 kV/mm. No changes on the dislocation plastic zone size, depth, and dislocation distribution are observed under this electric field. Based on the charge state of the dislocations in SrTiO3 as well as the electrical and thermal conductivity modified by dislocations, we discuss the forces induced by the electric field to act on the dislocations to underline the possible mechanisms for such dislocation behavior.

### AQUA: Attention via QUery mAgnitudes for Memory and Compute Efficient   Inference in LLMs
**Authors**: Santhosh G S, Saurav Prakash, Balaraman Ravindran

**Updated**: 2025-09-14T08:20:48Z

**Summary**: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

### Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV   Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Yijun Liu, Yixuan Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Shiyu Ji, Yang Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-09-13T03:34:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

### MCBP: A Memory-Compute Efficient LLM Inference Accelerator Leveraging   Bit-Slice-enabled Sparsity and Repetitiveness
**Authors**: Huizheng Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yousheng Long, Taiquan Wei, Jianxun Yang, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Shaojun Wei, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-09-12T16:05:27Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face significant inference latency due to inefficiencies in GEMM operations, weight access, and KV cache access, especially in real-time scenarios. This highlights the need for a versatile compute-memory efficient accelerator. Unfortunately, existing Transformer accelerators struggle to address both aspects simultaneously, as they focus on value-level processing, missing fine-grained opportunities to optimize computation and memory collaboratively. This paper introduces MCBP, a bit-grained compute-memory efficient algorithm-hardware co-design that leverages bit-slice (BS) enabled repetitiveness and sparsity to accelerate LLM inference. MCBP features three key innovations: 1) BS-repetitiveness-enabled computation reduction (BRCR), which eliminates redundant GEMM computations via leveraging redundancy hidden among BS vectors; 2) BS-sparsity-enabled two-state coding (BSTC), which reduces weight access via exploiting significant sparsity in high-order bit-slice weight; 3) Bit-grained progressive prediction (BGPP), which reduces KV cache access by leveraging early-termination-based bit-grained prediction. These techniques, supported by custom accelerator designs, effectively alleviate the burden in GEMM, weight access, and KV cache access. Extensive experiments on 26 benchmarks show that MCBP achieves 9.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia A100 GPU. Compared to SOTA Transformer accelerators, MCBP achieves 35x, 5.2x and 3.2x energy saving than Spatten, FACT and SOFA, respectively.

### Compute Only 16 Tokens in One Timestep: Accelerating Diffusion   Transformers with Cluster-Driven Feature Caching
**Authors**: Zhixin Zheng, Xinyu Wang, Chang Zou, Shaobo Wang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-12T14:53:45Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently, feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion.

### XBOF: A Cost-Efficient CXL JBOF with Inter-SSD Compute Resource Sharing
**Authors**: Shushu Yi, Yuda An, Li Peng, Xiurui Pan, Qiao Li, Jieming Yin, Guangyan Zhang, Wenfei Wu, Diyu Zhou, Zhenlin Wang, Xiaolin Wang, Yingwei Luo, Ke Zhou, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-12T13:49:27Z

**Summary**: Enterprise SSDs integrate numerous computing resources (e.g., ARM processor and onboard DRAM) to satisfy the ever-increasing performance requirements of I/O bursts. While these resources substantially elevate the monetary costs of SSDs, the sporadic nature of I/O bursts causes severe SSD resource underutilization in just a bunch of flash (JBOF) level. Tackling this challenge, we propose XBOF, a cost-efficient JBOF design, which only reserves moderate computing resources in SSDs at low monetary cost, while achieving demanded I/O performance through efficient inter-SSD resource sharing. Specifically, XBOF first disaggregates SSD architecture into multiple disjoint parts based on their functionality, enabling fine-grained SSD internal resource management. XBOF then employs a decentralized scheme to manage these disaggregated resources and harvests the computing resources of idle SSDs to assist busy SSDs in handling I/O bursts. This idea is facilitated by the cache-coherent capability of Compute eXpress Link (CXL), with which the busy SSDs can directly utilize the harvested computing resources to accelerate metadata processing. The evaluation results show that XBOF improves SSD resource utilization by 50.4% and saves 19.0% monetary costs with a negligible performance loss, compared to existing JBOF designs.

### LAVa: Layer-wise KV Cache Eviction with Dynamic Budget Allocation
**Authors**: Yiqun Shen, Song Yuan, Zhengze Zhang, Xiaoliang Wang, Daxin Jiang, Nguyen Cam-Tu

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T16:48:24Z

**Summary**: KV Cache is commonly used to accelerate LLM inference with long contexts, yet its high memory demand drives the need for cache compression. Existing compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies. Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks (e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available at https://github.com/MGDDestiny/Lava.

### TrEnv: Transparently Share Serverless Execution Environments Across   Different Functions and Nodes
**Authors**: Jialiang Huang, Teng Ma, Zheng Liu, Sixing Lin, Kang Chen, Jinlei Jiang, Xia Liao, Yingdi Shan, Yongwei Wu, Ning Zhang, Mengting Lu, Tao Ma, Haifeng Gong, Mingxing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T15:06:03Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container- and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents. TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61% memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like E2B.

### In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding
**Authors**: Zhuoyuan Li, Jiacheng Li, Yao Li, Jialin Li, Li Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T14:34:01Z

**Summary**: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF, all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework, termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second, we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63% and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

### VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information   Flow-Guided Optimization
**Authors**: Sihan Yang, Runsen Xu, Chenhang Cui, Tai Wang, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T12:06:49Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically, we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning, thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs. Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### Universal Workers: A Vision for Eliminating Cold Starts in Serverless   Computing
**Authors**: Saman Akbari, Manfred Hauswirth

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T10:20:20Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing enables developers to deploy code without managing infrastructure, but suffers from cold start overhead when initializing new function instances. Existing solutions such as "keep-alive" or "pre-warming" are costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers, which are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal initialization overhead. Based on an analysis of production workload traces, our key insight is that requests in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms show a highly skewed distribution, with most requests invoking a small subset of functions. We exploit this observation to approximate universal workers through locality groups and three-tier caching (handler, install, import). With this work, we aim to enable more efficient and scalable FaaS platforms capable of handling diverse workloads with minimal initialization overhead.

### Spotlight Attention: Towards Efficient LLM Generation via Non-linear   Hashing-based KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Yuxin Zhang, Gen Luo, Haiyuan Wan, Ziyang Gong, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T06:45:58Z

**Summary**: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

### Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training
**Authors**: Chenlu Zhan, Wen Li, Chuyu Shen, Jun Zhang, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T06:16:31Z

**Summary**: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

### Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling for Realistic Application
**Authors**: Guochu Xiong, Xiangzhong Luo, Weichen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T02:00:27Z

**Summary**: As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a critical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task execution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph modeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as the foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these strategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world applications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior, limiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task graph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they either rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features without producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed scheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often overlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and actual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that constructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the impact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution, quantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers inter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive experiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap between dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the importance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for accurate and generalizable system-level analysis.

**Authors**: Muhammad Taha Cheema, Abeer Aamir, Khawaja Gul Muhammad, Naveed Anwar Bhatti, Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, Zafar Ayyub Qazi

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer   Layer Caching
**Authors**: Siratish Sakpiboonchit

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:41:15Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference results can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ .

### BitROM: Weight Reload-Free CiROM Architecture Towards Billion-Parameter   1.58-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wenlun Zhang, Xinyu Li, Shimpei Ando, Kentaro Yoshioka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:46:29Z

**Summary**: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.

### Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split   Mechanism
**Authors**: Jiaming Yan, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:28:24Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

### EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Bohan Yu, Yekun Chai

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:32:49Z

**Summary**: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T13:30:17Z

**Summary**: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### DuoServe-MoE: Dual-Phase Expert Prefetch and Cache Scheduling for   Efficient MoE LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuning Zhang, Grant Pinkert, Nan Yang, Yanli Li, Dong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T04:00:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage. To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts, without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to 7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model size.

### BOLT: Bandwidth-Optimized Lightning-Fast Oblivious Map powered by Secure   HBM Accelerators
**Authors**: Yitong Guo, Hongbo Chen, Haobin Hiroki Chen, Yukui Luo, XiaoFeng Wang, Chenghong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T00:15:05Z

**Summary**: While Trusted Execution Environments provide a strong foundation for secure cloud computing, they remain vulnerable to access pattern leakages. Oblivious Maps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high overhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these costs are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that eavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its memory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same physical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper isolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and memory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with HBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits. Building on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized, Lightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) + O(log_2(log_2 (N))) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted architecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to mitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs that maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx U55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in initialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs, including an industry implementation from Facebook.

### Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning Framework for Diffusion Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yinjie Wang, Ling Yang, Bowen Li, Ye Tian, Ke Shen, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T17:58:06Z

**Summary**: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T17:22:17Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference is bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of CXL-based memory used for capacity expansion. We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T13:34:54Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

### CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View   Synthesis
**Authors**: Xin Kong, Daniel Watson, Yannick StrÃ¼mpler, Michael Niemeyer, Federico Tombari

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T11:49:51Z

**Summary**: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

### Scaling up Multi-Turn Off-Policy RL and Multi-Agent Tree Search for LLM   Step-Provers
**Authors**: Ran Xin, Zeyu Zheng, Yanchen Nie, Kun Yuan, Xia Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T09:54:18Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

### Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action   Pretraining
**Authors**: Zijian Song, Sihan Qin, Tianshui Chen, Liang Lin, Guangrun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T09:09:36Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### HyFedRAG: A Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for   Heterogeneous and Privacy-Sensitive Data
**Authors**: Cheng Qian, Hainan Zhang, Yongxin Tong, Hong-Wei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T08:44:24Z

**Summary**: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are: (1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich, de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache, and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data, unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

### Tree of Agents: Improving Long-Context Capabilities of Large Language   Models through Multi-Perspective Reasoning
**Authors**: Song Yu, Xiaofei Xu, Ke Deng, Li Li, Lin Tian

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T08:34:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aireduce952/Tree-of-Agents.

### A facile vector substrate platform via BaTiO3 membrane transfer enables   high quality solution processed epitaxial PZT on silicon
**Authors**: Asraful Haque, Antony Jeyaseelan, Shubham Kumar Parate, Srinivasan Raghavan, Pavan Nukala

**Updated**: 2025-09-07T13:15:17Z

**Summary**: The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.

### Tight Cache Contention Analysis for WCET Estimation on Multicore Systems
**Authors**: Shuai Zhao, Jieyu Jiang, Shenlin Cai, Yaowei Liang, Chen Jie, Yinjie Fang, Wei Zhang, Guoquan Zhang, Yaoyao Gu, Xiang Xiao, Wei Qin, Xiangzhen Ouyang, Wanli Chang

**Updated**: 2025-09-06T05:58:51Z

**Summary**: WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.

### RapidGNN: Energy and Communication-Efficient Distributed Training on   Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Arefin Niam, Tevfik Kosar, M S Q Zulkar Nine

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T16:10:20Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

### Mainframe-Style Channel Controllers for Modern Disaggregated Memory   Systems
**Authors**: Zikai Liu, Jasmin Schult, Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T10:39:03Z

**Summary**: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.   However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.   In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.

 ### Lyra: Generative 3D Scene Reconstruction via Video Diffusion Model   Self-Distillation
**Authors**: Sherwin Bahmani, Tianchang Shen, Jiawei Ren, Jiahui Huang, Yifeng Jiang, Haithem Turki, Andrea Tagliasacchi, David B. Lindell, Zan Gojcic, Sanja Fidler, Huan Ling, Jun Gao, Xuanchi Ren

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:58:01Z

**Summary**: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

### A Preliminary Study on the Robustness of Code Generation by Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zike Li, Mingwei Liu, Anji Li, Kaifeng He, Yanlin Wang, Xin Peng, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:57:16Z

**Summary**: Robustness is a critical factor for reliable code generation by large language models, yet most evaluations focus on correctness and overlook key issues such as missing input validation and inadequate error handling. In this work, we present the first empirical study of LLM-generated code robustness using the CoderEval benchmark. Evaluating four state-of-the-art code LLMs, we find that 35.2% of their outputs are less robust than human-written code, with over 90% of deficiencies caused by missing conditional checks-70% of which occur in the first line. Interestingly, in 63% of cases where a conditional statement is needed but absent, the "if" token still ranks among the top three predictions, suggesting implicit recognition of control flow.   To address these issues, we propose RobGen, a model-agnostic framework that improves robustness without retraining. RobGen combines a line-level intervention checker, which decides whether to adjust logits for each generated line, with token-level conditional logit adjustments to promote essential control structures. Experiments show that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust code by 10%, achieves the highest average Pass@1 (43.57), and adds minimal overhead (+33.4%). As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively enhances the reliability of LLM-generated code across diverse tasks.

### Language Models Do Not Have Human-Like Working Memory
**Authors**: Jen-tse Huang, Kaiser Sun, Wenxuan Wang, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:47:04Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, we demonstrate that they lack a fundamental aspect of human cognition: working memory. Human working memory is an active cognitive system that enables not only the temporary storage of information but also its processing and utilization, enabling coherent reasoning and decision-making. Without working memory, individuals may produce unrealistic responses, exhibit self-contradictions, and struggle with tasks that require mental reasoning. Existing evaluations using N-back or context-dependent tasks fall short as they allow LLMs to exploit external context rather than retaining the reasoning process in the latent space. We introduce three novel tasks: (1) Number Guessing, (2) Yes-No Deduction, and (3) Math Magic, designed to isolate internal representation from external context. Across seventeen frontier models spanning four major model families, we consistently observe irrational or contradictory behaviors, indicating LLMs' inability to retain and manipulate latent information. Our work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating working memory in LLMs and highlights this limitation as a key bottleneck for advancing reliable reasoning systems. Code and prompts for the experiments are available at https://github.com/penguinnnnn/LLM-Working-Memory.

### A Gradient Flow Approach to Solving Inverse Problems with Latent   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tim Y. J. Wang, O. Deniz Akyildiz

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:41:43Z

**Summary**: Solving ill-posed inverse problems requires powerful and flexible priors. We propose leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models for this task through a new training-free approach, termed Diffusion-regularized Wasserstein Gradient Flow (DWGF). Specifically, we formulate the posterior sampling problem as a regularized Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the latent space. We demonstrate the performance of our method on standard benchmarks using StableDiffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) as the prior.

### A Novel Site-Specific Inference Model for Urban Canyon Channels: From   Measurements to Modeling
**Authors**: Junzhe Song, Ruisi He, Mi Yang, Zhengyu Zhang, Xinwen Chen, Xiaoying Zhang, Bo Ai

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:40:49Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of intelligent transportation and smart city applications, urban canyon has become a critical scenario for the design and evaluation of wireless communication systems. Due to its unique environmental layout, the channel characteristics in urban canyon are strongly a street geometry and building distribution, thereby exhibiting significant site-specific channel condition. However, this feature has not been well captured in existing channel models. In this paper, we propose a site-specific channel inference model based on environmental geometry, the model is parameterized using sub-6GHz channel measurements. Multipath components (MPCs) are extracted and clustered according to geometric propagation, which are explicitly derived from the influence of canyon width, thereby establishing an interpretable mapping between the physical environment and statistical characteristics of MPCs. A step-by-step implementation scheme is presented. Subsequently, the proposed site-specific channel inference model is validated by comparing second-order statistics of channels, derived from the model and measurements. The results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness in different urban canyon scenarios.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:35:19Z

**Summary**: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Comet models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study of medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Consequently, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, Comet autoregressively predicts the next medical event to simulate patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, Comet generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. Comet's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that Comet, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

### Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to   Complexity Theory
**Authors**: Ansh Nagda, Prabhakar Raghavan, Abhradeep Thakurta

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:34:30Z

**Summary**: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:   a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.   b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.   A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

### Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier   LLMs
**Authors**: Alexander Panfilov, Evgenii Kortukov, Kristina NikoliÄ, Matthias Bethge, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Ameya Prabhu, Maksym Andriushchenko, Jonas Geiping

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:34:27Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.

### Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings
**Authors**: Nitesh Kumar, Usashi Chatterjee, Steven Schockaert

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:33:30Z

**Summary**: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

### Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yedi Hu, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen, Shumin Deng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:26:13Z

**Summary**: Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ModelKinship.

### Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time   Weak-to-Strong Aligner
**Authors**: Bolian Li, Yanran Wu, Xinyu Luo, Ruqi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:25:59Z

**Summary**: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

### LLM-Driven SAST-Genius: A Hybrid Static Analysis Framework for   Comprehensive and Actionable Security
**Authors**: Vaibhav Agrawal, Kiarash Ahi

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:24:40Z

**Summary**: This report examines the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to improve vulnerability discovery. Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely, LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20) compared to Semgrep alone.

### Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from   the Arab World
**Authors**: Saeed Almheiri, Rania Hossam, Mena Attia, Chenxi Wang, Preslav Nakov, Timothy Baldwin, Fajri Koto

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:24:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

### LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression
**Authors**: Jintian Zhang, Yuqi Zhu, Mengshu Sun, Yujie Luo, Shuofei Qiao, Lun Du, Da Zheng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:20:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.

### Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL): A Framework   for Modeling Complex Predator-Prey Dynamics
**Authors**: Julian Evan Chrisnanto, Salsabila Rahma Alia, Yulison Herry Chrisnanto, Ferry Faizal

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:20:11Z

**Summary**: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.

### Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:10:40Z

**Summary**: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

### CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners
**Authors**: Yunzhi Yao, Jizhan Fang, Jia-Chen Gu, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Nanyun Peng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:10:14Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.

### Exploring the Sub-Neptune Frontier with JWST
**Authors**: Nikku Madhusudhan, MÃ¥ns Holmberg, Savvas Constantinou, Gregory J. Cooke

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:08:30Z

**Summary**: Sub-Neptune planets, with sizes and masses between those of Earth and Neptune, dominate the exoplanet population. Sub-Neptunes are expected to be the most diverse family of the exoplanet population, potentially including rocky gas dwarfs, water worlds, and mini-Neptunes, with a wide range of atmospheric, surface and interior conditions. With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present new avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass-metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H$_2$O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H$_2$O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H$_2$ dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with super critical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.

### Benchmarking Critical Questions Generation: A Challenging Reasoning Task   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Banca Calvo Figueras, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:07:48Z

**Summary**: The task of Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) aims to foster critical thinking by enabling systems to generate questions that expose underlying assumptions and challenge the validity of argumentative reasoning structures. Despite growing interest in this area, progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic evaluation standards. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to support the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the first large-scale dataset including ~5K manually annotated questions. We also investigate automatic evaluation methods and propose reference-based techniques as the strategy that best correlates with human judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data and code plus a public leaderboard are provided to encourage further research, not only in terms of model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.

### Lavida-O: Elastic Large Masked Diffusion Models for Unified Multimodal   Understanding and Generation
**Authors**: Shufan Li, Jiuxiang Gu, Kangning Liu, Zhe Lin, Zijun Wei, Aditya Grover, Jason Kuen

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T09:38:15Z

**Summary**: We propose Lavida-O, a unified Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) for multimodal understanding and generation. Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.

### Visual Chronicles: Using Multimodal LLMs to Analyze Massive Collections   of Images
**Authors**: Boyang Deng, Songyou Peng, Kyle Genova, Gordon Wetzstein, Noah Snavely, Leonidas Guibas, Thomas Funkhouser

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:04:48Z

**Summary**: We present a system using Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to analyze a large database with tens of millions of images captured at different times, with the aim of discovering patterns in temporal changes. Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.). See more results and interactive demos at https://boyangdeng.com/visual-chronicles.

**Authors**: Kangwei Liu, Mengru Wang, Yujie Luo, Yuan Lin, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Bryan Hooi, Shumin Deng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:04:18Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.

### AgentInit: Initializing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems via Diversity and   Expertise Orchestration for Effective and Efficient Collaboration
**Authors**: Chunhao Tian, Yutong Wang, Xuebo Liu, Zhexuan Wang, Liang Ding, Miao Zhang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:58:54Z

**Summary**: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models are available at https://github.com/1737423697/AgentInit.

### CompLLM: Compression for Long Context Q&A
**Authors**: Gabriele Berton, Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Son Tran, Mubarak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:49:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.

### A Survey on Sparse Autoencoders: Interpreting the Internal Mechanisms of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:48:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.

### Beyond Input Activations: Identifying Influential Latents by Gradient   Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Mengnan Du, Ninghao Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:43:51Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.

### Large Vision-Language Model Alignment and Misalignment: A Survey Through   the Lens of Explainability
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Haiyan Zhao, Jingyu Hu, Weiru Liu, Ali Payani, Lu Cheng, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:40:27Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing both visual and textual information. However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.

### Conformal Convolution and Monte Carlo Meta-learners for Predictive   Inference of Individual Treatment Effects
**Authors**: Jef Jonkers, Jarne Verhaeghe, Glenn Van Wallendael, Luc Duchateau, Sofie Van Hoecke

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:40:14Z

**Summary**: Generating probabilistic forecasts of potential outcomes and individual treatment effects (ITE) is essential for risk-aware decision-making in domains such as healthcare, policy, marketing, and finance. We propose two novel methods: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT) and the conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learner, that generate full predictive distributions of both potential outcomes and ITEs. Our approaches combine weighted conformal predictive systems with either analytic convolution of potential outcome distributions or Monte Carlo sampling, addressing covariate shift through propensity score weighting. In contrast to other approaches that allow the generation of potential outcome predictive distributions, our approaches are model agnostic, universal, and come with finite-sample guarantees of probabilistic calibration under knowledge of the propensity score. Regarding estimating the ITE distribution, we formally characterize how assumptions about potential outcomes' noise dependency impact distribution validity and establish universal consistency under independence noise assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions while maintaining narrow prediction intervals and having performant continuous ranked probability scores. Besides probabilistic forecasting performance, we observe significant efficiency gains for the CCT- and CMC meta-learners compared to other conformal approaches that produce prediction intervals for ITE with coverage guarantees.

**Authors**: Kiana Kheiri, Aamna Aamir, Andriy Miranskyy, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:36:24Z

**Summary**: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90% and 63.00%. GRPO performs well on basic tasks (44/78) and excels on intermediate ones (41/68), but neither GRPO nor ORPO solves any of the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.

**Summary**: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, yet large PPG foundation models remain difficult to deploy on resource-limited devices. We present PPG-Distill, a knowledge distillation framework that transfers both global and local knowledge through prediction-, feature-, and patch-level distillation. PPG-Distill incorporates morphology distillation to preserve local waveform patterns and rhythm distillation to capture inter-patch temporal structures. On heart rate estimation and atrial fibrillation detection, PPG-Distill improves student performance by up to 21.8% while achieving 7X faster inference and reducing memory usage by 19X, enabling efficient PPG analysis on wearables

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:30:58Z

**Summary**: Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.

### A Knowledge Graph and a Tripartite Evaluation Framework Make   Retrieval-Augmented Generation Scalable and Transparent
**Authors**: Olalekan K. Akindele, Bhupesh Kumar Mishra, Kenneth Y. Wertheim

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:29:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational Artificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the avoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly for large datasets. Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and evaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a knowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich responses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering project-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A central innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation (RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework specifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in parallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved document, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across multiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage, coherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to users as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of possible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes transparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs, timestamps into responses. Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and G-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and empirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query mismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments. These findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate, user-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational fluency and factual accuracy.

**Summary**: Expanding the abbreviated column names of tables, such as "esal" to "employee salary", is critical for many downstream NLP tasks for tabular data, such as NL2SQL, table QA, and keyword search. This problem arises in enterprises, domain sciences, government agencies, and more. In this paper, we make three contributions that significantly advance the state of the art. First, we show that the synthetic public data used by prior work has major limitations, and we introduce four new datasets in enterprise/science domains, with real-world abbreviations. Second, we show that accuracy measures used by prior work seriously undercount correct expansions, and we propose new synonym-aware measures that capture accuracy much more accurately. Finally, we develop Columbo, a powerful LLM-based solution that exploits context, rules, chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most advanced solution, by 4-29%, over five datasets. Columbo has been used in production on EDI, a major data lake for environmental sciences.

### Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Junge Zhang, Jianbin Jiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T01:27:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.

### Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based   Fusion
**Authors**: Luigi Celona, Simone Bianco, Marco Donzella, Paolo Napoletano

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:12:45Z

**Summary**: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

### Unveiling the Role of Learning Rate Schedules via Functional Scaling   Laws
**Authors**: Binghui Li, Fengling Chen, Zixun Huang, Lean Wang, Lei Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T05:27:45Z

**Summary**: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL), which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for improving large-scale model training.

### Bayesian Neural Networks versus deep ensembles for uncertainty   quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials
**Authors**: Riccardo Farris, Emanuele Telari, Nongnuch Artrith, Konstantin Neyman, Albert Bruix

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:52:18Z

**Summary**: Neural-network-based machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for predicting atomic energies and forces, enabling accurate and efficient simulations in atomistic modeling. A key limitation of traditional deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science, where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815 TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.

### Soft Tokens, Hard Truths
**Authors**: Natasha Butt, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Ismail Labiad, Julia Kempe, Yann Ollivier

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:43:47Z

**Summary**: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.   This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:40:36Z

**Summary**: This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.   Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.   For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p. Moreover.   Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size.

### Unlearning as Ablation: Toward a Falsifiable Benchmark for Generative   Scientific Discovery
**Authors**: Robert Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:40:35Z

**Summary**: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.

### Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level   RL
**Authors**: Hanyi Mao, Quanjia Xiao, Lei Pang, Haixiao Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:39:49Z

**Summary**: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.

### NeuCODEX: Edge-Cloud Co-Inference with Spike-Driven Compression and   Dynamic Early-Exit
**Authors**: Maurf Hassan, Steven Davy, Muhammad Zawish, Owais Bin Zuber, Nouman Ashraf

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:34:33Z

**Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity
**Authors**: Massimo Bartoletti, Enrico Lipparini, Livio Pompianu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:32:13Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.

### Anecdoctoring: Automated Red-Teaming Across Language and Place
**Authors**: Alejandro Cuevas, Saloni Dash, Bharat Kumar Nayak, Dan Vann, Madeleine I. G. Daepp

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:26:13Z

**Summary**: Disinformation is among the top risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI) misuse. Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and English-centric. To address this gap, we propose "anecdoctoring", a novel red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies (US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.

### BiGraspFormer: End-to-End Bimanual Grasp Transformer
**Authors**: Kangmin Kim, Seunghyeok Back, Geonhyup Lee, Sangbeom Lee, Sangjun Noh, Kyoobin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:26:04Z

**Summary**: Bimanual grasping is essential for robots to handle large and complex objects. However, existing methods either focus solely on single-arm grasping or employ separate grasp generation and bimanual evaluation stages, leading to coordination problems including collision risks and unbalanced force distribution. To address these limitations, we propose BiGraspFormer, a unified end-to-end transformer framework that directly generates coordinated bimanual grasps from object point clouds. Our key idea is the Single-Guided Bimanual (SGB) strategy, which first generates diverse single grasp candidates using a transformer decoder, then leverages their learned features through specialized attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation experiments and real-world validation demonstrate that BiGraspFormer consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining efficient inference speed (<0.05s), confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

### On the Soundness and Consistency of LLM Agents for Executing Test Cases   Written in Natural Language
**Authors**: SÃ©bastien Salva, Redha Taguelmimt

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:20:40Z

**Summary**: The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.

### Can Global XAI Methods Reveal Injected Bias in LLMs? SHAP vs Rule   Extraction vs RuleSHAP
**Authors**: Francesco Sovrano

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:19:17Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.

### Probing LLM World Models: Enhancing Guesstimation with Wisdom of Crowds   Decoding
**Authors**: Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Sameer Narendran, Nikunj Harlalka, Alexander Cheung, Sizhe Gao, Siddharth Suresh, Junjie Hu, Timothy T. Rogers

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:17:03Z

**Summary**: Guesstimation--the task of making approximate quantitative estimates about objects or events-is a common real--world skill, yet remains underexplored in large language model (LLM) research. We introduce three guesstimation datasets: MARBLES, FUTURE, and ELECPRED, spanning physical estimation (e.g., how many marbles fit in a cup) to abstract predictions (e.g., the 2024 U.S. presidential election). Inspired by the social science concept of Wisdom of Crowds (WOC)- where the median of multiple estimates improves accuracy-we propose WOC decoding for LLMs. We replicate WOC effects in human participants and find that LLMs exhibit similar benefits: median aggregation across sampled responses consistently improves accuracy over greedy decoding, self-consistency decoding, and mean decoding. This suggests that LLMs encode a world model that supports approximate reasoning. Our results position guesstimation as a useful probe of LLM world knowledge and highlight WOC decoding as a strategy for enhancing LLM guesstimation performance on real-world tasks.

### PipelineRL: Faster On-policy Reinforcement Learning for Long Sequence   Generatio
**Authors**: Alexandre PichÃ©, Ehsan Kamaloo, Rafael Pardinas, Dzmitry Bahdanau

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:15:21Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.

### Are Vision-Language Models Safe in the Wild? A Meme-Based Benchmark   Study
**Authors**: DongGeon Lee, Joonwon Jang, Jihae Jeong, Hwanjo Yu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:14:42Z

**Summary**: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms. MemeSafetyBench is publicly available at https://github.com/oneonlee/Meme-Safety-Bench.

### Context-Aware Hierarchical Taxonomy Generation for Scientific Papers via   LLM-Guided Multi-Aspect Clustering
**Authors**: Kun Zhu, Lizi Liao, Yuxuan Gu, Lei Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:12:58Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

**Summary**: The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of short-duration (transient) gravitational wave signals identified by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration in gravitational-wave data produced by the eponymous detectors. The catalog provides information about the identified candidates, such as the arrival time and amplitude of the signal and properties of the signal's source as inferred from the observational data. GWTC is the data release of this dataset and version 4.0 extends the catalog to include observations made during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run up until 2024 January 31. This paper marks an introduction to a collection of articles related to this version of the catalog, GWTC-4.0. The collection of articles accompanying the catalog provides documentation of the methods used to analyze the data, summaries of the catalog of events, observational measurements drawn from the population, and detailed discussions of selected candidates

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:07:33Z

**Summary**: Detecting disinformation that blends manipulated text and images has become increasingly challenging, as AI tools make synthetic content easy to generate and disseminate. While most existing AI safety benchmarks focus on single modality misinformation (i.e., false content shared without intent to deceive), intentional multimodal disinformation, such as propaganda or conspiracy theories that imitate credible news, remains largely unaddressed. We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.

### LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics
**Authors**: Felix Weissberg, Lukas Pirch, Erik Imgrund, Jonas MÃ¶ller, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Konrad Rieck

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:03:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.

### DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via   Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Zhuoyuan Mao, Mengjie Zhao, Qiyu Wu, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:01:37Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-LLM fusion Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We open-source the codes, models and datasets we constructed: github.com/sony/DeepResonance.

### Track-On2: Enhancing Online Point Tracking with Memory
**Authors**: GÃ¶rkay Aydemir, Weidi Xie, Fatma GÃ¼ney

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:00:18Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which requires consistent identification of points across video frames under significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2, a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking. Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking.

### Towards Practical Multi-label Causal Discovery in High-Dimensional Event   Sequences via One-Shot Graph Aggregation
**Authors**: Hugo Math, Rainer Lienhart

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:58:50Z

**Summary**: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

### The DeepJoint algorithm: An innovative approach for studying the   longitudinal evolution of quantitative mammographic density and its   association with screen-detected breast cancer risk
**Authors**: Manel Rakez, Julien Guillaumin, Aurelien Chick, Gaelle Coureau, Foucauld Chamming's, Pierre Fillard, Brice Amadeo, Virginie Rondeau

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:54:29Z

**Summary**: Mammographic density is a dynamic risk factor for breast cancer and affects the sensitivity of mammography-based screening. While automated machine and deep learning-based methods provide more consistent and precise measurements compared to subjective BI-RADS assessments, they often fail to account for the longitudinal evolution of density. Many of these methods assess mammographic density in a cross-sectional manner, overlooking correlations in repeated measures, irregular visit intervals, missing data, and informative dropouts. Joint models, however, are well-suited for capturing the longitudinal relationship between biomarkers and survival outcomes. We present the DeepJoint algorithm, an open-source solution that integrates deep learning for quantitative mammographic density estimation with joint modeling to assess the longitudinal relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer risk. Our method efficiently analyzes processed mammograms from various manufacturers, estimating both dense area and percent density--established risk factors for breast cancer. We utilize a joint model to explore their association with breast cancer risk and provide individualized risk predictions. Bayesian inference and the Monte Carlo consensus algorithm make the approach reliable for large screening datasets. Our method allows for accurate analysis of processed mammograms from multiple manufacturers, offering a comprehensive view of breast cancer risk based on individual longitudinal density profiles. The complete pipeline is publicly available, promoting broader application and comparison with other methods.

### DRO-REBEL: Distributionally Robust Relative-Reward Regression for Fast   and Efficient LLM Alignment
**Authors**: Sharan Sahu, Martin T. Wells

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:49:48Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

### Spectral Signature Mapping from RGB Imagery for Terrain-Aware Navigation
**Authors**: Sarvesh Prajapati, Ananya Trivedi, Nathaniel Hanson, Bruce Maxwell, Taskin Padir

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:49:48Z

**Summary**: Successful navigation in outdoor environments requires accurate prediction of the physical interactions between the robot and the terrain. To this end, several methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics, widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In this paper, we present RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net), a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces. Thus, we introduce a framework that learns the task-relevant physical property once during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at test time. The code is available at https://github.com/prajapatisarvesh/RS-Net.

### Algorithms for Adversarially Robust Deep Learning
**Authors**: Alexander Robey

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:48:58Z

**Summary**: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.

### DivLogicEval: A Framework for Benchmarking Logical Reasoning Evaluation   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tsz Ting Chung, Lemao Liu, Mo Yu, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:48:18Z

**Summary**: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

### Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure   Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Alva West, Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Zhen Lin, Zhiyuan Ning, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:45:53Z

**Summary**: Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this \emph{counterfactual inference gap}, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution. Ours code are released at https://github.com/ResearAI/A2P.

### Pathways of Thoughts: Multi-Directional Thinking for Long-form   Personalized Question Answering
**Authors**: Alireza Salemi, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Zhuowan Li, Spurthi Amba Hombaiah, Weize Kong, Tao Chen, Hamed Zamani, Michael Bendersky

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:44:46Z

**Summary**: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct, contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT), an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM) without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories, producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

### Citrus-V: Advancing Medical Foundation Models with Unified Medical Image   Grounding for Clinical Reasoning
**Authors**: Guoxin Wang, Jun Zhao, Xinyi Liu, Yanbo Liu, Xuyang Cao, Chao Li, Zhuoyun Liu, Qintian Sun, Fangru Zhou, Haoqiang Xing, Zhenhong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T08:19:50Z

**Summary**: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.

**Summary**: Do "digital twins" capture individual responses in surveys and experiments? We run 19 pre-registered studies on a national U.S. panel and their LLM-powered digital twins (constructed based on previously-collected extensive individual-level data) and compare twin and human answers across 164 outcomes. The correlation between twin and human answers is modest (approximately 0.2 on average) and twin responses are less variable than human responses. While constructing digital twins based on rich individual-level data improves our ability to capture heterogeneity across participants and predict relative differences between them, it does not substantially improve our ability to predict the exact answers given by specific participants or enhance predictions of population means. Twin performance varies by domain and is higher among more educated, higher-income, and ideologically moderate participants. These results suggest current digital twins can capture some degree of relative differences but are unreliable for individual-level predictions and sample mean and variance estimation, underscoring the need for careful validation before use. Our data and code are publicly available for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing digital twin pipelines.

### 3rd Place Report of LSVOS 2025 MeViS Track: Sa2VA-i: Improving Sa2VA   Results with Consistent Training and Inference
**Authors**: Alexey Nekrasov, Ali Athar, Daan de Geus, Alexander Hermans, Bastian Leibe

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:38:25Z

**Summary**: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We provide the code and updated models at https://github.com/kumuji/sa2va-i

### Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes
**Authors**: Jian Xu, Qibin Zhao, John Paisley, Delu Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:36:47Z

**Summary**: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

### Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic
**Authors**: Zikang Tian, Shaohui Peng, Du Huang, Jiaming Guo, Ruizhi Chen, Rui Zhang, Xishan Zhang, Yuxuan Guo, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Ling Li, Yewen Pu, Xing Hu, Yunji Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:36:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.

### Linking Young Stellar Object Morphology to Evolutionary Stages with   Self-Organizing Maps
**Authors**: David Hernandez, Odysseas Dionatos, Marc Audard, GÃ¡bor Marton, Julia Roquette, Ilknur Gezer, MÃ¡tÃ© MadarÃ¡sz, Kai L. Polsterer

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:33:02Z

**Summary**: Studies in the past few decades have investigated young stellar object evolution based on their spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED is heavily influenced not only by evolutionary stage, but also the morphology of the young star. This work is part of the NEMESIS project which is aiming to revisit star formation with the aid of machine learning techniques and provides the framework for this work. In a first effort towards a novel spectro-morphological classification we analyzed young stellar object morphologies and linked them to the currently used observational classes. Thereby we aim to lay the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification, and apply the insights learned in this study in a future, revisited classification scheme. We obtained archival high-resolution survey images from VISTA for approximately 10,000 literature young stellar object candidates towards the Orion star formation complex (OSFC). Utilizing a Self-Organizing map (SOM) algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, we created a grid of morphological prototypes from near- and mid-infrared images. Furthermore, we determined which prototypes are most representative of the different observational classes, derived from the infrared spectral index, via Bayesian inference. We present our grids of morphological prototypes of young stellar objects in the near-infrared, which were created purely from observational data. They are thus non-dependent on theoretical models. In addition, we show maps that indicate the probability for a prototype belonging to any of the observational classes. We find that SOMs created from near-infrared images are a useful tool, with limitations, to identify characteristic morphologies of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. This first step lays the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification of young stellar objects to be developed in the future.

### A Multimodal Conversational Assistant for the Characterization of   Agricultural Plots from Geospatial Open Data
**Authors**: Juan CaÃ±ada, RaÃºl Alonso, Julio Molleda, Fidel DÃ­ez

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:32:50Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) and agricultural datasets holds great potential for supporting sustainable land management. However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.

### Dwarf Galaxies in the MATLAS Survey: Hubble Space Telescope Observations   of Nuclear Star Clusters

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:32:33Z

**Summary**: In dwarf galaxies, nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are believed to primarily form from the migration and merger of globular clusters (GCs), with a possible contribution from in-situ star-forming activity triggered by gas infall. We present the study of NSCs in 41 MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies including ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), as part of a large follow-up imaging program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) using the F606W and F814W filters. The sample is biased towards low-surface brightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies with a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's high spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We modeled the NSCs with a S\'ersic profile and derived their structural properties and photometry. We find the NSC S\'ersic index to increase with the luminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective radius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile, whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.

### AvatarShield: Visual Reinforcement Learning for Human-Centric Synthetic   Video Detection
**Authors**: Zhipei Xu, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Huang, Xing Zhou, Jian Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:29:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to highly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios involving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to information authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

### The Narcissus Hypothesis: Descending to the Rung of Illusion
**Authors**: Riccardo Cadei, Christian InternÃ²

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:28:10Z

**Summary**: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.

### Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving   Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems
**Authors**: Vinay Sharma, Olga Fink

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:26:51Z

**Summary**: Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.

### T-Detect: Tail-Aware Statistical Normalization for Robust Detection of   Adversarial Machine-Generated Text
**Authors**: Alva West, Luodan Zhang, Liuliu Zhang, Minjun Zhu, Yixuan Weng, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:22:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generate fluent and logical content, presenting significant challenges to machine-generated text detection, particularly text polished by adversarial perturbations such as paraphrasing. Current zero-shot detectors often employ Gaussian distributions as statistical measure for computing detection thresholds, which falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. In this paper, we introduce T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at https://github.com/ResearAI/t-detect.

### RELATE: Relation Extraction in Biomedical Abstracts with LLMs and   Ontology Constraints
**Authors**: Olawumi Olasunkanmi, Mathew Satursky, Hong Yi, Chris Bizon, Harlin Lee, Stanley Ahalt

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:21:46Z

**Summary**: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for drug discovery and clinical decision support but remain incomplete. Large language models (LLMs) excel at extracting biomedical relations, yet their outputs lack standardization and alignment with ontologies, limiting KG integration. We introduce RELATE, a three-stage pipeline that maps LLM-extracted relations to standardized ontology predicates using ChemProt and the Biolink Model. The pipeline includes: (1) ontology preprocessing with predicate embeddings, (2) similarity-based retrieval enhanced with SapBERT, and (3) LLM-based reranking with explicit negation handling. This approach transforms relation extraction from free-text outputs to structured, ontology-constrained representations. On the ChemProt benchmark, RELATE achieves 52% exact match and 94% accuracy@10, and in 2,400 HEAL Project abstracts, it effectively rejects irrelevant associations (0.4%) and identifies negated assertions. RELATE captures nuanced biomedical relationships while ensuring quality for KG augmentation. By combining vector search with contextual LLM reasoning, RELATE provides a scalable, semantically accurate framework for converting unstructured biomedical literature into standardized KGs.

### Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks for Prior Learning in Graph   Signal Recovery
**Authors**: Razieh Torkamani, Arash Amini, Hadi Zayyani, Mehdi Korki

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:21:03Z

**Summary**: Graph signal recovery (GSR) is a fundamental problem in graph signal processing, where the goal is to reconstruct a complete signal defined over a graph from a subset of noisy or missing observations. A central challenge in GSR is that the underlying statistical model of the graph signal is often unknown or too complex to specify analytically. To address this, we propose a flexible, data-driven framework that learns the signal prior directly from training samples. We develop a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) architecture that models the prior distribution of graph signals using graph-aware filters based on Chebyshev polynomials. By interpreting the hidden layers of the CNN as Gibbs distributions and employing Gaussian mixture model (GMM) nonlinearities, we obtain a closed-form and expressive prior. This prior is integrated into a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework to estimate the posterior distribution of the signal and noise precision. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCNN-GSR algorithm achieves accurate and robust recovery across a variety of signal distributions. The method generalizes well to complex, non-Gaussian signal models and remains computationally efficient, making it suitable for practical large-scale graph recovery tasks.

### Single-stream Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Zhongwen Xu, Zihan Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:19:47Z

**Summary**: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

### Nonparametric efficient estimation of the longitudinal front-door   functional
**Authors**: Marie S. Breum, Helene C. W. Rytgaard, Torben Martinussen, Erin E. Gabriel

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:09:50Z

**Summary**: The front-door criterion is an identification strategy for the intervention-specific mean outcome in settings where the standard back-door criterion fails due to unmeasured exposure-outcome confounders, but an intermediate variable exists that completely mediates the effect of exposure on the outcome and is not affected by unmeasured confounding. The front-door criterion has been extended to the longitudinal setting, where exposure and mediator are measured repeatedly over time. However, to the best of our knowledge, applications of the longitudinal front-door criterion remain unexplored. This may reflect both limited awareness of the method and the absence of suitable estimation techniques. In this report, we propose nonparametric efficient estimators of the longitudinal front-door functional. The estimators are multiply robust and allow for the use of data-adaptive (machine learning) methods for nuisance estimation while providing valid inference. The theoretical properties of the estimators are showcased in a simulation study.

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T07:17:32Z

**Summary**: Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions in the field.

### Linguistic Neuron Overlap Patterns to Facilitate Cross-lingual Transfer   on Low-resource Languages
**Authors**: Yuemei Xu, Kexin Xu, Jian Zhou, Ling Hu, Lin Gui

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:02:49Z

**Summary**: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in improving their performance on low-resource languages and urgently need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of language-bridge, we propose a simple yet effective method, namely BridgeX-ICL, to improve the zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance in LLMs. We construct neuron probe data from the ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language overlap neurons accordingly to ensure full activation of these anchored neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum based on overlapping neurons, guiding optimal bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 4 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families, covering both high-low and moderate-low pairs, validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xuyuemei/BridgeX-ICL.

### Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning   System Performance Estimation
**Authors**: Jianxing Qin, Jingrong Chen, Xinhao Kong, Yongji Wu, Tianjun Yuan, Liang Luo, Zhaodong Wang, Ying Zhang, Tingjun Chen, Alvin R. Lebeck, Danyang Zhuo

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:01:26Z

**Summary**: Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on both computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate performance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system design decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster configurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based performance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator, which demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML frameworks evolve rapidly.   This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for performance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified ML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each container emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while Phantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to provide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid simulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate static workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows direct reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for reimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy comparable to static workload simulation while supporting three state-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora operates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace collection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based simulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.

### EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Yingxu Wang, Siwei Liu, Jinyuan Fang, Zaiqiao Meng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:00:26Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

### Investigating Test-Time Scaling with Reranking for Machine Translation
**Authors**: Shaomu Tan, Ryosuke Mitani, Ritvik Choudhary, Toshiyuki Sekiya

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:58:16Z

**Summary**: Scaling model parameters has become the de facto strategy for improving NLP systems, but it comes with substantial computational costs. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference: generating multiple candidates and selecting the best. While effective in tasks such as mathematical reasoning, TTS has not been systematically explored for machine translation (MT). In this paper, we present the first systematic study of TTS for MT, investigating a simple but practical best-of-N framework on WMT24 benchmarks. Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up to 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally improves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation metrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller models with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more compute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more efficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in low-resource cases.

### OmniBridge: Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation, and Retrieval   via Latent Space Alignment
**Authors**: Teng Xiao, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:57:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.

### Unraveling Misinformation Propagation in LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yiyang Feng, Yichen Wang, Shaobo Cui, Boi Faltings, Mina Lee, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:50:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%), and the degradation holds with thinking models (4.30% - 19.97%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.

### Unveiling Chain of Step Reasoning for Vision-Language Models with   Fine-grained Rewards
**Authors**: Honghao Chen, Xingzhou Lou, Xiaokun Feng, Kaiqi Huang, Xinlong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:47:32Z

**Summary**: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at https://github.com/baaivision/CoS.

### HD-PPT: Hierarchical Decoding of Content- and Prompt-Preference Tokens   for Instruction-based TTS
**Authors**: Sihang Nie, Xiaofen Xing, Jingyuan Xing, Baiji Liu, Xiangmin Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:45:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have already reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://xxh333.github.io/.

### CR-Net: Scaling Parameter-Efficient Training with Cross-Layer Low-Rank   Structure
**Authors**: Boao Kong, Junzhu Liang, Yuxi Liu, Renjia Deng, Kun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:43:02Z

**Summary**: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1) compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3) limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters. We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

### Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning
**Authors**: Carson Dudley, Marisa Eisenberg

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:39:11Z

**Summary**: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.   We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.   We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.

### Simulating Online Social Media Conversations on Controversial Topics   Using AI Agents Calibrated on Real-World Data
**Authors**: Elisa Composta, Nicolo' Fontana, Francesco Corso, Francesco Pierri

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:36:48Z

**Summary**: Online social networks offer a valuable lens to analyze both individual and collective phenomena. Researchers often use simulators to explore controlled scenarios, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes these simulations more realistic by enabling agents to understand and generate natural language content. In this work, we investigate the behavior of LLM-based agents in a simulated microblogging social network. We initialize agents with realistic profiles calibrated on real-world online conversations from the 2022 Italian political election and extend an existing simulator by introducing mechanisms for opinion modeling. We examine how LLM agents simulate online conversations, interact with others, and evolve their opinions under different scenarios. Our results show that LLM agents generate coherent content, form connections, and build a realistic social network structure. However, their generated content displays less heterogeneity in tone and toxicity compared to real data. We also find that LLM-based opinion dynamics evolve over time in ways similar to traditional mathematical models. Varying parameter configurations produces no significant changes, indicating that simulations require more careful cognitive modeling at initialization to replicate human behavior more faithfully. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs for simulating user behavior in social environments, while also identifying key challenges in capturing heterogeneity and complex dynamics.

### Difficulty-Aware Agent Orchestration in LLM-Powered Workflows
**Authors**: Jinwei Su, Yinghui Xia, Qizhen Lan, Xinyuan Song, Chen Chen, Yang Jingsong, Lewei He, Tianyu Shi

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:32:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.

### LLM Agents for Interactive Workflow Provenance: Reference Architecture   and Evaluation Methodology
**Authors**: Renan Souza, Timothy Poteet, Brian Etz, Daniel Rosendo, Amal Gueroudji, Woong Shin, Prasanna Balaprakash, Rafael Ferreira da Silva

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:31:18Z

**Summary**: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum. Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.

### From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated   explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system
**Authors**: Maxime Manderlier, Fabian Lecron, Olivier Vu Thanh, Nicolas Gillis

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:30:03Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:24:48Z

**Summary**: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.

### Otters: An Energy-Efficient SpikingTransformer via Optical   Time-to-First-Spike Encoding
**Authors**: Zhanglu Yan, Jiayi Mao, Qianhui Liu, Fanfan Li, Gang Pan, Tao Luo, Bowen Zhu, Weng-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:23:48Z

**Summary**: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process. Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All codes and data are open source.

### Benchmarking PDF Accessibility Evaluation A Dataset and Framework for   Assessing Automated and LLM-Based Approaches for Accessibility Testing
**Authors**: Anukriti Kumar, Tanushree Padath, Lucy Lu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:17:13Z

**Summary**: PDFs remain the dominant format for scholarly communication, despite significant accessibility challenges for blind and low-vision users. While various tools attempt to evaluate PDF accessibility, there is no standardized methodology to evaluate how different accessibility assessment approaches perform. Our work addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel benchmark dataset of scholarly PDFs with expert-validated accessibility annotations across seven criteria (alternative text quality, logical reading order, semantic tagging, table structure, functional hyperlinks, color contrast, and font readability), and a four-category evaluation framework with standardized labels (Passed, Failed, Not Present, Cannot Tell) to systematically assess accessibility evaluation approaches. Using our evaluation framework, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting automated accessibility evaluation. We benchmark five LLMs, which demonstrate varying capabilities in correctly assessing different accessibility criteria, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving the highest overall accuracy (0.85). However, all models struggled in correctly categorizing documents with Not Present and Cannot Tell accessibility labels, particularly for alt text quality assessment. Our qualitative comparison with standard automated checkers reveals complementary strengths: rule-based tools excel at technical verification, while LLMs better evaluate semantic appropriateness and contextual relevance. Based on our findings, we propose a hybrid approach that would combine automated checkers, LLM evaluation, and human assessment as a future strategy for PDF accessibility evaluation.

### Towards Privacy-Aware Bayesian Networks: A Credal Approach
**Authors**: NiccolÃ² Rocchi, Fabio Stella, Cassio de Campos

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:58:32Z

**Summary**: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.

### One-shot Embroidery Customization via Contrastive LoRA Modulation
**Authors**: Jun Ma, Qian He, Gaofeng He, Huang Chen, Chen Liu, Xiaogang Jin, Huamin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:58:15Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques, and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties, which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation. Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer, we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### A Preliminary Study on the Robustness of Code Generation by Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zike Li, Mingwei Liu, Anji Li, Kaifeng He, Yanlin Wang, Xin Peng, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:57:16Z

**Summary**: Robustness is a critical factor for reliable code generation by large language models, yet most evaluations focus on correctness and overlook key issues such as missing input validation and inadequate error handling. In this work, we present the first empirical study of LLM-generated code robustness using the CoderEval benchmark. Evaluating four state-of-the-art code LLMs, we find that 35.2% of their outputs are less robust than human-written code, with over 90% of deficiencies caused by missing conditional checks-70% of which occur in the first line. Interestingly, in 63% of cases where a conditional statement is needed but absent, the "if" token still ranks among the top three predictions, suggesting implicit recognition of control flow.   To address these issues, we propose RobGen, a model-agnostic framework that improves robustness without retraining. RobGen combines a line-level intervention checker, which decides whether to adjust logits for each generated line, with token-level conditional logit adjustments to promote essential control structures. Experiments show that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust code by 10%, achieves the highest average Pass@1 (43.57), and adds minimal overhead (+33.4%). As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively enhances the reliability of LLM-generated code across diverse tasks.

### Language Models Do Not Have Human-Like Working Memory
**Authors**: Jen-tse Huang, Kaiser Sun, Wenxuan Wang, Mark Dredze

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:47:04Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, we demonstrate that they lack a fundamental aspect of human cognition: working memory. Human working memory is an active cognitive system that enables not only the temporary storage of information but also its processing and utilization, enabling coherent reasoning and decision-making. Without working memory, individuals may produce unrealistic responses, exhibit self-contradictions, and struggle with tasks that require mental reasoning. Existing evaluations using N-back or context-dependent tasks fall short as they allow LLMs to exploit external context rather than retaining the reasoning process in the latent space. We introduce three novel tasks: (1) Number Guessing, (2) Yes-No Deduction, and (3) Math Magic, designed to isolate internal representation from external context. Across seventeen frontier models spanning four major model families, we consistently observe irrational or contradictory behaviors, indicating LLMs' inability to retain and manipulate latent information. Our work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating working memory in LLMs and highlights this limitation as a key bottleneck for advancing reliable reasoning systems. Code and prompts for the experiments are available at https://github.com/penguinnnnn/LLM-Working-Memory.

### Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to   Complexity Theory
**Authors**: Ansh Nagda, Prabhakar Raghavan, Abhradeep Thakurta

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:34:30Z

**Summary**: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:   a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.   b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.   A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

### Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier   LLMs
**Authors**: Alexander Panfilov, Evgenii Kortukov, Kristina NikoliÄ, Matthias Bethge, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Ameya Prabhu, Maksym Andriushchenko, Jonas Geiping

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:34:27Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.

### Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings
**Authors**: Nitesh Kumar, Usashi Chatterjee, Steven Schockaert

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:33:30Z

**Summary**: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

### Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yedi Hu, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen, Shumin Deng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:26:13Z

**Summary**: Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ModelKinship.

### Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time   Weak-to-Strong Aligner
**Authors**: Bolian Li, Yanran Wu, Xinyu Luo, Ruqi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:25:59Z

**Summary**: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

### Future-Proofing Cloud Security Against Quantum Attacks: Risk,   Transition, and Mitigation Strategies
**Authors**: Yaser Baseri, Abdelhakim Hafid, Arash Habibi Lashkari

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:25:54Z

**Summary**: Quantum Computing (QC) introduces a transformative threat to digital security, with the potential to compromise widely deployed classical cryptographic systems. This survey offers a comprehensive and systematic examination of quantumsafe security for Cloud Computing (CC), focusing on the vulnerabilities, transition strategies, and mitigation mechanisms required to secure cloud infrastructures in the quantum era. We evaluated the landscape of quantum threats across the entire CC stack, demonstrating how quantum algorithms can undermine classical encryption and compromise cloud security at multiple architectural layers. Using a structured risk assessment methodology based on the STRIDE model, we evaluate quantum-induced attack vectors and their impact on cloud environments. To address these challenges, we propose a layered security framework that integrates hybrid cryptographic transition strategies, cryptographic agility, and proactive risk mitigation. We analyze the preparation and implementation approaches of the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including AWS, Azure and GCP, synthesizing platform-specific initiatives toward Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Furthermore, we provide a detailed evaluation of standardized PQC algorithms, exploring their resilience to side-channel and active attacks within cloud-native deployments. This survey serves as a strategic reference for cloud architects, policymakers, and researchers, offering actionable insights for navigating the complex transition to quantum-resilient cloud systems. We conclude by identifying six key future research directions: standardization and interoperability, performance and scalability, implementation security, integration with emerging technologies, systemic preparedness, and crypto-agile migration frameworks.

### LLM-Driven SAST-Genius: A Hybrid Static Analysis Framework for   Comprehensive and Actionable Security
**Authors**: Vaibhav Agrawal, Kiarash Ahi

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:24:40Z

**Summary**: This report examines the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to improve vulnerability discovery. Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely, LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20) compared to Semgrep alone.

### Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from   the Arab World
**Authors**: Saeed Almheiri, Rania Hossam, Mena Attia, Chenxi Wang, Preslav Nakov, Timothy Baldwin, Fajri Koto

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:24:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

### LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression
**Authors**: Jintian Zhang, Yuqi Zhu, Mengshu Sun, Yujie Luo, Shuofei Qiao, Lun Du, Da Zheng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:20:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.

### Adversarially-Refined VQ-GAN with Dense Motion Tokenization for   Spatio-Temporal Heatmaps
**Authors**: Gabriel Maldonado, Narges Rashvand, Armin Danesh Pazho, Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre, Vinit Katariya, Hamed Tabkhi

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:12:20Z

**Summary**: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications. The code base for this work is available at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Pose-Quantization.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:10:40Z

**Summary**: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

### CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners
**Authors**: Yunzhi Yao, Jizhan Fang, Jia-Chen Gu, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Nanyun Peng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:10:14Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.

### Benchmarking Critical Questions Generation: A Challenging Reasoning Task   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Banca Calvo Figueras, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:07:48Z

**Summary**: The task of Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) aims to foster critical thinking by enabling systems to generate questions that expose underlying assumptions and challenge the validity of argumentative reasoning structures. Despite growing interest in this area, progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic evaluation standards. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to support the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the first large-scale dataset including ~5K manually annotated questions. We also investigate automatic evaluation methods and propose reference-based techniques as the strategy that best correlates with human judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data and code plus a public leaderboard are provided to encourage further research, not only in terms of model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.

### Visual Chronicles: Using Multimodal LLMs to Analyze Massive Collections   of Images
**Authors**: Boyang Deng, Songyou Peng, Kyle Genova, Gordon Wetzstein, Noah Snavely, Leonidas Guibas, Thomas Funkhouser

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:04:48Z

**Summary**: We present a system using Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to analyze a large database with tens of millions of images captured at different times, with the aim of discovering patterns in temporal changes. Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.). See more results and interactive demos at https://boyangdeng.com/visual-chronicles.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T17:04:18Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.

### AgentInit: Initializing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems via Diversity and   Expertise Orchestration for Effective and Efficient Collaboration
**Authors**: Chunhao Tian, Yutong Wang, Xuebo Liu, Zhexuan Wang, Liang Ding, Miao Zhang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:58:54Z

**Summary**: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models are available at https://github.com/1737423697/AgentInit.

### CompLLM: Compression for Long Context Q&A
**Authors**: Gabriele Berton, Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Son Tran, Mubarak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:49:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.

### MsFIN: Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network for Traffic Accident   Anticipation
**Authors**: Tongshuai Wu, Chao Lu, Ze Song, Yunlong Lin, Sizhe Fan, Xuemei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:49:25Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term, mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion and contextual interaction modeling.

### A Survey on Sparse Autoencoders: Interpreting the Internal Mechanisms of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:48:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.

### Beyond Input Activations: Identifying Influential Latents by Gradient   Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Mengnan Du, Ninghao Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:43:51Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:36:24Z

**Summary**: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90% and 63.00%. GRPO performs well on basic tasks (44/78) and excels on intermediate ones (41/68), but neither GRPO nor ORPO solves any of the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.

**Summary**: Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.

### A Knowledge Graph and a Tripartite Evaluation Framework Make   Retrieval-Augmented Generation Scalable and Transparent
**Authors**: Olalekan K. Akindele, Bhupesh Kumar Mishra, Kenneth Y. Wertheim

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:29:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational Artificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the avoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly for large datasets. Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and evaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a knowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich responses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering project-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A central innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation (RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework specifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in parallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved document, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across multiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage, coherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to users as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of possible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes transparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs, timestamps into responses. Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and G-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and empirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query mismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments. These findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate, user-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational fluency and factual accuracy.

### Columbo: Expanding Abbreviated Column Names for Tabular Data Using Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Ting Cai, Stephen Sheen, AnHai Doan

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:19:06Z

**Summary**: Expanding the abbreviated column names of tables, such as "esal" to "employee salary", is critical for many downstream NLP tasks for tabular data, such as NL2SQL, table QA, and keyword search. This problem arises in enterprises, domain sciences, government agencies, and more. In this paper, we make three contributions that significantly advance the state of the art. First, we show that the synthetic public data used by prior work has major limitations, and we introduce four new datasets in enterprise/science domains, with real-world abbreviations. Second, we show that accuracy measures used by prior work seriously undercount correct expansions, and we propose new synonym-aware measures that capture accuracy much more accurately. Finally, we develop Columbo, a powerful LLM-based solution that exploits context, rules, chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most advanced solution, by 4-29%, over five datasets. Columbo has been used in production on EDI, a major data lake for environmental sciences.

### Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Junge Zhang, Jianbin Jiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T01:27:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.

### Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based   Fusion
**Authors**: Luigi Celona, Simone Bianco, Marco Donzella, Paolo Napoletano

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T16:12:45Z

**Summary**: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

### Unveiling the Role of Learning Rate Schedules via Functional Scaling   Laws
**Authors**: Binghui Li, Fengling Chen, Zixun Huang, Lean Wang, Lei Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T05:27:45Z

**Summary**: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL), which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for improving large-scale model training.

**Authors**: Vincent Halde, Olivier Bernard, Mathieu Brochu, Laurier Dufresne, Nicolas Fleury, Kayla Johnson, Benjamin Moffet, David Roy-Guay

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:50:09Z

**Summary**: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center magnetometry is a highly promising quantum sensing technology, with early prototypes demonstrating impressive sensitivity in compact sensing heads. Yet, most existing implementations remain tied to laboratory setups, lacking the portability and environmental robustness needed to unlock their full potential in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a fully portable, hand-held NV-based magnetometer that delivers a vector sensitivity of approximately 400 pT/sqrt(Hz), heading errors below 5 nT in Earth's field, and a wide signal bandwidth that supports on-field recalibration and operation on moving platforms. We further demonstrate the system's technological maturity through environmental qualification such as thermal, vibration, radiation and other operational stresses related to deployment in low Earth orbit, and through successful deployments in demanding scenarios, including northern Canadian weather conditions, drone-mounted surveys and high-altitude balloon flights. Together, these achievements establish this NV-based magnetometer as a robust, versatile tool ready to bring quantum sensing performance to a broad range of field and autonomous applications.

### Soft Tokens, Hard Truths
**Authors**: Natasha Butt, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Ismail Labiad, Julia Kempe, Yann Ollivier

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:43:47Z

**Summary**: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.   This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

### MagiClaw: A Dual-Use, Vision-Based Soft Gripper for Bridging the Human   Demonstration to Robotic Deployment Gap
**Authors**: Tianyu Wu, Xudong Han, Haoran Sun, Zishang Zhang, Bangchao Huang, Chaoyang Song, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:43:28Z

**Summary**: The transfer of manipulation skills from human demonstration to robotic execution is often hindered by a "domain gap" in sensing and morphology. This paper introduces MagiClaw, a versatile two-finger end-effector designed to bridge this gap. MagiClaw functions interchangeably as both a handheld tool for intuitive data collection and a robotic end-effector for policy deployment, ensuring hardware consistency and reliability. Each finger incorporates a Soft Polyhedral Network (SPN) with an embedded camera, enabling vision-based estimation of 6-DoF forces and contact deformation. This proprioceptive data is fused with exteroceptive environmental sensing from an integrated iPhone, which provides 6D pose, RGB video, and LiDAR-based depth maps. Through a custom iOS application, MagiClaw streams synchronized, multi-modal data for real-time teleoperation, offline policy learning, and immersive control via mixed-reality interfaces. We demonstrate how this unified system architecture lowers the barrier to collecting high-fidelity, contact-rich datasets and accelerates the development of generalizable manipulation policies.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:40:36Z

**Summary**: This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.   Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.   For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p. Moreover.   Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size.

### Unlearning as Ablation: Toward a Falsifiable Benchmark for Generative   Scientific Discovery
**Authors**: Robert Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:40:35Z

**Summary**: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.

### Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level   RL
**Authors**: Hanyi Mao, Quanjia Xiao, Lei Pang, Haixiao Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:39:49Z

**Summary**: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.

### Dynamical Low-Rank Compression of Neural Networks with Robustness under   Adversarial Attacks
**Authors**: Steffen SchotthÃ¶fer, H. Lexie Yang, Stefan Schnake

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:39:30Z

**Summary**: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing accuracy on clean data. The method is model- and data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.

### NeuCODEX: Edge-Cloud Co-Inference with Spike-Driven Compression and   Dynamic Early-Exit
**Authors**: Maurf Hassan, Steven Davy, Muhammad Zawish, Owais Bin Zuber, Nouman Ashraf

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:34:33Z

**Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity
**Authors**: Massimo Bartoletti, Enrico Lipparini, Livio Pompianu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:32:13Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.

### Anecdoctoring: Automated Red-Teaming Across Language and Place
**Authors**: Alejandro Cuevas, Saloni Dash, Bharat Kumar Nayak, Dan Vann, Madeleine I. G. Daepp

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:26:13Z

**Summary**: Disinformation is among the top risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI) misuse. Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and English-centric. To address this gap, we propose "anecdoctoring", a novel red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies (US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.

### On the Soundness and Consistency of LLM Agents for Executing Test Cases   Written in Natural Language
**Authors**: SÃ©bastien Salva, Redha Taguelmimt

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:20:40Z

**Summary**: The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.

### Can Global XAI Methods Reveal Injected Bias in LLMs? SHAP vs Rule   Extraction vs RuleSHAP
**Authors**: Francesco Sovrano

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:19:17Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.

**Authors**: Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Sameer Narendran, Nikunj Harlalka, Alexander Cheung, Sizhe Gao, Siddharth Suresh, Junjie Hu, Timothy T. Rogers

**Summary**: Guesstimation--the task of making approximate quantitative estimates about objects or events-is a common real--world skill, yet remains underexplored in large language model (LLM) research. We introduce three guesstimation datasets: MARBLES, FUTURE, and ELECPRED, spanning physical estimation (e.g., how many marbles fit in a cup) to abstract predictions (e.g., the 2024 U.S. presidential election). Inspired by the social science concept of Wisdom of Crowds (WOC)- where the median of multiple estimates improves accuracy-we propose WOC decoding for LLMs. We replicate WOC effects in human participants and find that LLMs exhibit similar benefits: median aggregation across sampled responses consistently improves accuracy over greedy decoding, self-consistency decoding, and mean decoding. This suggests that LLMs encode a world model that supports approximate reasoning. Our results position guesstimation as a useful probe of LLM world knowledge and highlight WOC decoding as a strategy for enhancing LLM guesstimation performance on real-world tasks.

### PipelineRL: Faster On-policy Reinforcement Learning for Long Sequence   Generatio
**Authors**: Alexandre PichÃ©, Ehsan Kamaloo, Rafael Pardinas, Dzmitry Bahdanau

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:15:21Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.

### Are Vision-Language Models Safe in the Wild? A Meme-Based Benchmark   Study
**Authors**: DongGeon Lee, Joonwon Jang, Jihae Jeong, Hwanjo Yu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:14:42Z

**Summary**: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms. MemeSafetyBench is publicly available at https://github.com/oneonlee/Meme-Safety-Bench.

### Context-Aware Hierarchical Taxonomy Generation for Scientific Papers via   LLM-Guided Multi-Aspect Clustering
**Authors**: Kun Zhu, Lizi Liao, Yuxuan Gu, Lei Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:12:58Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

**Authors**: Shaina Raza, Ashmal Vayani, Aditya Jain, Aravind Narayanan, Vahid Reza Khazaie, Syed Raza Bashir, Elham Dolatabadi, Gias Uddin, Christos Emmanouilidis, Rizwan Qureshi, Mubarak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:07:33Z

**Summary**: Detecting disinformation that blends manipulated text and images has become increasingly challenging, as AI tools make synthetic content easy to generate and disseminate. While most existing AI safety benchmarks focus on single modality misinformation (i.e., false content shared without intent to deceive), intentional multimodal disinformation, such as propaganda or conspiracy theories that imitate credible news, remains largely unaddressed. We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.

### FedFiTS: Fitness-Selected, Slotted Client Scheduling for Trustworthy   Federated Learning in Healthcare AI
**Authors**: Ferdinand Kahenga, Antoine Bagula, Sajal K. Das, Patrick Sello

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:06:04Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability, and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL, making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.

### Enabling Drone Detection with SWARM Repeater-Assisted MIMO ISAC
**Authors**: Palatip Jopanya, Diana P. M. Osorio

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:05:51Z

**Summary**: As definitions about new architectural aspects, use cases, and standards for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) continue to appear, cellular systems based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology are also experiencing a parallel evolution through the integration of novel network components. This evolution should support emerging ISAC use cases and services. In particular, this paper explores a recent vision for cost-efficient cellular network densification through the deployment of swarms of repeaters. Leveraging their ability to retransmit signals instantaneously, we investigate how these repeaters can enhance radar sensing capabilities for drone detection in a swarm repeater-assisted MIMO ISAC system. Our results demonstrate that, by optimizing the gains of repeaters given a sufficient maximum amplification gain, increasing the number of repeaters can lead to gains in sensing performance.

### LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics
**Authors**: Felix Weissberg, Lukas Pirch, Erik Imgrund, Jonas MÃ¶ller, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Konrad Rieck

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:03:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.

### DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via   Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Zhuoyuan Mao, Mengjie Zhao, Qiyu Wu, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T15:01:37Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-LLM fusion Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We open-source the codes, models and datasets we constructed: github.com/sony/DeepResonance.

**Authors**: Paul McHard, Florent P. Audonnet, Oliver Summerell, Sebastian Andraos, Paul Henderson, Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:58:35Z

**Summary**: Surface defects are a primary source of yield loss in manufacturing, yet existing anomaly detection methods often fail in real-world deployment due to limited and unrepresentative datasets. To overcome this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, a 3D Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing dataset, that is the first large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for RGB+3D surface defect detection in additive manufacturing. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 unique parts, captured with four industrial depth sensors, and includes 27,346 annotated defects across 12 categories along with 27,346 annotations of machine element features in 16 classes. 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment and as such reflects real production conditions, including variations in part placement, sensor positioning, lighting, and partial occlusion. Benchmarking state-of-the-art models demonstrates that 3D-ADAM presents substantial challenges beyond existing datasets. Validation through expert labelling surveys with industry partners further confirms its industrial relevance. By providing this benchmark, 3D-ADAM establishes a foundation for advancing robust 3D anomaly detection capable of meeting manufacturing demands.

### DRO-REBEL: Distributionally Robust Relative-Reward Regression for Fast   and Efficient LLM Alignment
**Authors**: Sharan Sahu, Martin T. Wells

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:49:48Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

### Spectral Signature Mapping from RGB Imagery for Terrain-Aware Navigation
**Authors**: Sarvesh Prajapati, Ananya Trivedi, Nathaniel Hanson, Bruce Maxwell, Taskin Padir

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:49:48Z

**Summary**: Successful navigation in outdoor environments requires accurate prediction of the physical interactions between the robot and the terrain. To this end, several methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics, widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In this paper, we present RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net), a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces. Thus, we introduce a framework that learns the task-relevant physical property once during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at test time. The code is available at https://github.com/prajapatisarvesh/RS-Net.

### FUNCanon: Learning Pose-Aware Action Primitives via Functional Object   Canonicalization for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Hongli Xu, Lei Zhang, Xiaoyue Hu, Boyang Zhong, Kaixin Bai, ZoltÃ¡n-Csaba MÃ¡rton, Zhenshan Bing, Zhaopeng Chen, Alois Christian Knoll, Jianwei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:49:05Z

**Summary**: General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/funcanon.

### Algorithms for Adversarially Robust Deep Learning
**Authors**: Alexander Robey

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:48:58Z

**Summary**: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.

### DivLogicEval: A Framework for Benchmarking Logical Reasoning Evaluation   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tsz Ting Chung, Lemao Liu, Mo Yu, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:48:18Z

**Summary**: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

### Pathways of Thoughts: Multi-Directional Thinking for Long-form   Personalized Question Answering
**Authors**: Alireza Salemi, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Zhuowan Li, Spurthi Amba Hombaiah, Weize Kong, Tao Chen, Hamed Zamani, Michael Bendersky

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:44:46Z

**Summary**: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct, contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT), an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM) without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories, producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:42:14Z

**Summary**: Do "digital twins" capture individual responses in surveys and experiments? We run 19 pre-registered studies on a national U.S. panel and their LLM-powered digital twins (constructed based on previously-collected extensive individual-level data) and compare twin and human answers across 164 outcomes. The correlation between twin and human answers is modest (approximately 0.2 on average) and twin responses are less variable than human responses. While constructing digital twins based on rich individual-level data improves our ability to capture heterogeneity across participants and predict relative differences between them, it does not substantially improve our ability to predict the exact answers given by specific participants or enhance predictions of population means. Twin performance varies by domain and is higher among more educated, higher-income, and ideologically moderate participants. These results suggest current digital twins can capture some degree of relative differences but are unreliable for individual-level predictions and sample mean and variance estimation, underscoring the need for careful validation before use. Our data and code are publicly available for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing digital twin pipelines.

### Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic
**Authors**: Zikang Tian, Shaohui Peng, Du Huang, Jiaming Guo, Ruizhi Chen, Rui Zhang, Xishan Zhang, Yuxuan Guo, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Ling Li, Yewen Pu, Xing Hu, Yunji Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:36:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.

### A Multimodal Conversational Assistant for the Characterization of   Agricultural Plots from Geospatial Open Data
**Authors**: Juan CaÃ±ada, RaÃºl Alonso, Julio Molleda, Fidel DÃ­ez

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:32:50Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) and agricultural datasets holds great potential for supporting sustainable land management. However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.

### AvatarShield: Visual Reinforcement Learning for Human-Centric Synthetic   Video Detection
**Authors**: Zhipei Xu, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Huang, Xing Zhou, Jian Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:29:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to highly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios involving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to information authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generate fluent and logical content, presenting significant challenges to machine-generated text detection, particularly text polished by adversarial perturbations such as paraphrasing. Current zero-shot detectors often employ Gaussian distributions as statistical measure for computing detection thresholds, which falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. In this paper, we introduce T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at https://github.com/ResearAI/t-detect.

### RELATE: Relation Extraction in Biomedical Abstracts with LLMs and   Ontology Constraints
**Authors**: Olawumi Olasunkanmi, Mathew Satursky, Hong Yi, Chris Bizon, Harlin Lee, Stanley Ahalt

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:21:46Z

**Summary**: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for drug discovery and clinical decision support but remain incomplete. Large language models (LLMs) excel at extracting biomedical relations, yet their outputs lack standardization and alignment with ontologies, limiting KG integration. We introduce RELATE, a three-stage pipeline that maps LLM-extracted relations to standardized ontology predicates using ChemProt and the Biolink Model. The pipeline includes: (1) ontology preprocessing with predicate embeddings, (2) similarity-based retrieval enhanced with SapBERT, and (3) LLM-based reranking with explicit negation handling. This approach transforms relation extraction from free-text outputs to structured, ontology-constrained representations. On the ChemProt benchmark, RELATE achieves 52% exact match and 94% accuracy@10, and in 2,400 HEAL Project abstracts, it effectively rejects irrelevant associations (0.4%) and identifies negated assertions. RELATE captures nuanced biomedical relationships while ensuring quality for KG augmentation. By combining vector search with contextual LLM reasoning, RELATE provides a scalable, semantically accurate framework for converting unstructured biomedical literature into standardized KGs.

### Single-stream Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Zhongwen Xu, Zihan Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:19:47Z

**Summary**: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

**Updated**: 2025-09-24T07:17:32Z

**Summary**: Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions in the field.

### Linguistic Neuron Overlap Patterns to Facilitate Cross-lingual Transfer   on Low-resource Languages
**Authors**: Yuemei Xu, Kexin Xu, Jian Zhou, Ling Hu, Lin Gui

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:02:49Z

**Summary**: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in improving their performance on low-resource languages and urgently need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of language-bridge, we propose a simple yet effective method, namely BridgeX-ICL, to improve the zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance in LLMs. We construct neuron probe data from the ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language overlap neurons accordingly to ensure full activation of these anchored neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum based on overlapping neurons, guiding optimal bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 4 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families, covering both high-low and moderate-low pairs, validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xuyuemei/BridgeX-ICL.

### Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning   System Performance Estimation
**Authors**: Jianxing Qin, Jingrong Chen, Xinhao Kong, Yongji Wu, Tianjun Yuan, Liang Luo, Zhaodong Wang, Ying Zhang, Tingjun Chen, Alvin R. Lebeck, Danyang Zhuo

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:01:26Z

**Summary**: Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on both computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate performance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system design decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster configurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based performance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator, which demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML frameworks evolve rapidly.   This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for performance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified ML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each container emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while Phantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to provide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid simulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate static workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows direct reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for reimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy comparable to static workload simulation while supporting three state-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora operates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace collection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based simulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.

### EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Yingxu Wang, Siwei Liu, Jinyuan Fang, Zaiqiao Meng

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T14:00:26Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

### OmniBridge: Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation, and Retrieval   via Latent Space Alignment
**Authors**: Teng Xiao, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:57:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.

### Unraveling Misinformation Propagation in LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yiyang Feng, Yichen Wang, Shaobo Cui, Boi Faltings, Mina Lee, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:50:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%), and the degradation holds with thinking models (4.30% - 19.97%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.

### HD-PPT: Hierarchical Decoding of Content- and Prompt-Preference Tokens   for Instruction-based TTS
**Authors**: Sihang Nie, Xiaofen Xing, Jingyuan Xing, Baiji Liu, Xiangmin Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:45:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have already reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://xxh333.github.io/.

### CR-Net: Scaling Parameter-Efficient Training with Cross-Layer Low-Rank   Structure
**Authors**: Boao Kong, Junzhu Liang, Yuxi Liu, Renjia Deng, Kun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:43:02Z

**Summary**: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1) compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3) limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters. We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

### Simulating Online Social Media Conversations on Controversial Topics   Using AI Agents Calibrated on Real-World Data
**Authors**: Elisa Composta, Nicolo' Fontana, Francesco Corso, Francesco Pierri

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:36:48Z

**Summary**: Online social networks offer a valuable lens to analyze both individual and collective phenomena. Researchers often use simulators to explore controlled scenarios, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes these simulations more realistic by enabling agents to understand and generate natural language content. In this work, we investigate the behavior of LLM-based agents in a simulated microblogging social network. We initialize agents with realistic profiles calibrated on real-world online conversations from the 2022 Italian political election and extend an existing simulator by introducing mechanisms for opinion modeling. We examine how LLM agents simulate online conversations, interact with others, and evolve their opinions under different scenarios. Our results show that LLM agents generate coherent content, form connections, and build a realistic social network structure. However, their generated content displays less heterogeneity in tone and toxicity compared to real data. We also find that LLM-based opinion dynamics evolve over time in ways similar to traditional mathematical models. Varying parameter configurations produces no significant changes, indicating that simulations require more careful cognitive modeling at initialization to replicate human behavior more faithfully. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs for simulating user behavior in social environments, while also identifying key challenges in capturing heterogeneity and complex dynamics.

### Difficulty-Aware Agent Orchestration in LLM-Powered Workflows
**Authors**: Jinwei Su, Yinghui Xia, Qizhen Lan, Xinyuan Song, Chen Chen, Yang Jingsong, Lewei He, Tianyu Shi

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:32:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.

### LLM Agents for Interactive Workflow Provenance: Reference Architecture   and Evaluation Methodology
**Authors**: Renan Souza, Timothy Poteet, Brian Etz, Daniel Rosendo, Amal Gueroudji, Woong Shin, Prasanna Balaprakash, Rafael Ferreira da Silva

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:31:18Z

**Summary**: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum. Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.

### From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated   explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system
**Authors**: Maxime Manderlier, Fabian Lecron, Olivier Vu Thanh, Nicolas Gillis

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:30:03Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:24:48Z

**Summary**: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.

### Benchmarking PDF Accessibility Evaluation A Dataset and Framework for   Assessing Automated and LLM-Based Approaches for Accessibility Testing
**Authors**: Anukriti Kumar, Tanushree Padath, Lucy Lu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:17:13Z

**Summary**: PDFs remain the dominant format for scholarly communication, despite significant accessibility challenges for blind and low-vision users. While various tools attempt to evaluate PDF accessibility, there is no standardized methodology to evaluate how different accessibility assessment approaches perform. Our work addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel benchmark dataset of scholarly PDFs with expert-validated accessibility annotations across seven criteria (alternative text quality, logical reading order, semantic tagging, table structure, functional hyperlinks, color contrast, and font readability), and a four-category evaluation framework with standardized labels (Passed, Failed, Not Present, Cannot Tell) to systematically assess accessibility evaluation approaches. Using our evaluation framework, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting automated accessibility evaluation. We benchmark five LLMs, which demonstrate varying capabilities in correctly assessing different accessibility criteria, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving the highest overall accuracy (0.85). However, all models struggled in correctly categorizing documents with Not Present and Cannot Tell accessibility labels, particularly for alt text quality assessment. Our qualitative comparison with standard automated checkers reveals complementary strengths: rule-based tools excel at technical verification, while LLMs better evaluate semantic appropriateness and contextual relevance. Based on our findings, we propose a hybrid approach that would combine automated checkers, LLM evaluation, and human assessment as a future strategy for PDF accessibility evaluation.

### Eva-VLA: Evaluating Vision-Language-Action Models' Robustness Under   Real-World Physical Variations
**Authors**: Hanqing Liu, Jiahuan Long, Junqi Wu, Jiacheng Hou, Huili Tang, Tingsong Jiang, Weien Zhou, Wen Yao

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T13:02:23Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising solutions for robotic manipulation, yet their robustness to real-world physical variations remains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the first unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA models by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous optimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness presents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse physical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining evaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios without prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address the first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical domains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination variations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that disrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a continuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical variations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of worst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models across multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types trigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to 97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between controlled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the Eva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic manipulation models against real-world deployment challenges.

### Adaptive Kernel Design for Bayesian Optimization Is a Piece of CAKE with   LLMs
**Authors**: Richard Cornelius Suwandi, Feng Yin, Juntao Wang, Renjie Li, Tsung-Hui Chang, Sergios Theodoridis

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:57:08Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/richardcsuwandi/cake.

### Data Efficient Adaptation in Large Language Models via Continuous   Low-Rank Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Xiao Han, Zimo Zhao, Wanyu Wang, Maolin Wang, Zitao Liu, Yi Chang, Xiangyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:55:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

**Authors**: Haonan He, Yuchen Ren, Yining Tang, Ziyang Xu, Junxian Li, Minghao Yang, Di Zhang, Dong Yuan, Tao Chen, Shufei Zhang, Yuqiang Li, Nanqing Dong, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou, Peng Ye

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:55:03Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains, but their application to multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset for multi-omics biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules. This dataset bridges LLMs and complex biological sequence-related tasks, enhancing their versatility and reasoning while maintaining conversational fluency. We also highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs on multi-omics tasks without specialized training. To overcome this, we propose ChatMultiOmics, a strong baseline with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating superior biological understanding through Biology-Instructions. Both resources are publicly available, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in multi-omics analysis. The Biology-Instructions is publicly available at: https://github.com/hhnqqq/Biology-Instructions.

### Lang2Morph: Language-Driven Morphological Design of Robotic Hands
**Authors**: Yanyuan Qiao, Kieran Gilday, Yutong Xie, Josie Hughes

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:54:52Z

**Summary**: Designing robotic hand morphologies for diverse manipulation tasks requires balancing dexterity, manufacturability, and task-specific functionality. While open-source frameworks and parametric tools support reproducible design, they still rely on expert heuristics and manual tuning. Automated methods using optimization are often compute-intensive, simulation-dependent, and rarely target dexterous hands. Large language models (LLMs), with their broad knowledge of human-object interactions and strong generative capabilities, offer a promising alternative for zero-shot design reasoning. In this paper, we present Lang2Morph, a language-driven pipeline for robotic hand design. It uses LLMs to translate natural-language task descriptions into symbolic structures and OPH-compatible parameters, enabling 3D-printable task-specific morphologies. The pipeline consists of: (i) Morphology Design, which maps tasks into semantic tags, structural grammars, and OPH-compatible parameters; and (ii) Selection and Refinement, which evaluates design candidates based on semantic alignment and size compatibility, and optionally applies LLM-guided refinement when needed. We evaluate Lang2Morph across varied tasks, and results show that our approach can generate diverse, task-relevant morphologies. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an LLM-based framework for task-conditioned robotic hand design.

### Generic Adversarial Smart Contract Detection with Semantics and   Uncertainty-Aware LLM
**Authors**: Yating Liu, Xing Su, Hao Wu, Sijin Li, Yuxi Cheng, Fengyuan Xu, Sheng Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:52:05Z

**Summary**: Adversarial smart contracts, mostly on EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum and BSC, are deployed as EVM bytecode to exploit vulnerable smart contracts typically for financial gains. Detecting such malicious contracts at the time of deployment is an important proactive strategy preventing loss from victim contracts. It offers a better cost-benefit than detecting vulnerabilities on diverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited detection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging LLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key problems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code inputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs' certainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we propose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which leverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet takes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones among them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise semantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode inputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input. The second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its multi-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness for binary classifications required by the task output. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that FinDet achieves a BAC of 0.9223 and a TPR of 0.8950, significantly outperforming existing baselines. It remains robust under challenging conditions including unseen attack patterns, low-data settings, and feature obfuscation. FinDet detects all 5 public and 20+ unreported adversarial contracts in a 10-day real-world test, confirmed manually.

**Authors**: Gabriele Formis, Gianluca Cena, Lukasz Wisniewski, Stefano Scanzio

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:52:01Z

**Summary**: Wireless communications are characterized by their unpredictability, posing challenges for maintaining consistent communication quality. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various prediction models, with a focus on achieving accurate and efficient Wi-Fi link quality forecasts using machine learning techniques. Specifically, the paper evaluates the performance of data-driven models based on the linear combination of exponential moving averages, which are designed for low-complexity implementations and are then suitable for hardware platforms with limited processing resources. Accuracy of the proposed approaches was assessed using experimental data from a real-world Wi-Fi testbed, considering both channel-dependent and channel-independent training data. Remarkably, channel-independent models, which allow for generalized training by equipment manufacturers, demonstrated competitive performance. Overall, this study provides insights into the practical deployment of machine learning-based prediction models for enhancing Wi-Fi dependability in industrial environments.

### Learning coordinated badminton skills for legged manipulators
**Authors**: Yuntao Ma, Andrei Cramariuc, Farbod Farshidian, Marco Hutter

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:45:55Z

**Summary**: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

### Without Paired Labeled Data: End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for   Drone-view Geo-Localization
**Authors**: Zhongwei Chen, Zhao-Xu Yang, Hai-Jun Rong, Guoqi Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T12:39:26Z

**Summary**: Drone-view Geo-Localization (DVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of drones by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, most existing methods heavily rely on strictly pre-paired drone-satellite images for supervised learning. When the target region shifts, new paired samples are typically required to adapt to the distribution changes. The high cost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods significantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning method with a shallow backbone network, called the dynamic memory-driven and neighborhood information learning (DMNIL) method. It employs a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, DMNIL incorporates two core modules, including the dynamic hierarchical memory learning (DHML) module and the information consistency evolution learning (ICEL) module. The DHML module combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the ICEL module utilizes a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, consequently improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced to enhance the quality of pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/DMNIL.

### PolBiX: Detecting LLMs' Political Bias in Fact-Checking through   X-phemisms
**Authors**: Charlott Jakob, David Harbecke, Patrick Parschan, Pia Wenzel Neves, Vera Schmitt

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T11:42:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are increasingly used in applications requiring objective assessment, which could be compromised by political bias. Many studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for objectivism in prompts. Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.

### Extractive Fact Decomposition for Interpretable Natural Language   Inference in one Forward Pass
**Authors**: Nicholas PopoviÄ, Michael FÃ¤rber

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T11:30:42Z

**Summary**: Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training, we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and synthetic rationales.

**Authors**: Yongrui Chen, Junhao He, Linbo Fu, Shenyu Zhang, Rihui Jin, Xinbang Dai, Jiaqi Li, Dehai Min, Nan Hu, Yuxin Zhang, Guilin Qi, Yi Huang, Tongtong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T11:15:44Z

**Summary**: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T11:07:18Z

**Summary**: We present the first release of SmartWilds, a multimodal wildlife monitoring dataset. SmartWilds is a synchronized collection of drone imagery, camera trap photographs and videos, and bioacoustic recordings collected during summer 2025 at The Wilds safari park in Ohio. This dataset supports multimodal AI research for comprehensive environmental monitoring, addressing critical needs in endangered species research, conservation ecology, and habitat management. Our pilot deployment captured four days of synchronized monitoring across three modalities in a 220-acre pasture containing Pere David's deer, Sichuan takin, Przewalski's horses, as well as species native to Ohio, including bald eagles, white-tailed deer, and coyotes. We provide a comparative analysis of sensor modality performance, demonstrating complementary strengths for landuse patterns, species detection, behavioral analysis, and habitat monitoring. This work establishes reproducible protocols for multimodal wildlife monitoring while contributing open datasets to advance conservation computer vision research. Future releases will include synchronized GPS tracking data from tagged individuals, citizen science data, and expanded temporal coverage across multiple seasons.

### Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs
**Authors**: Marcin Chrapek, Marcin Copik, Etienne Mettaz, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T10:36:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).

### Diversity Boosts AI-Generated Text Detection
**Authors**: Advik Raj Basani, Pin-Yu Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T10:21:22Z

**Summary**: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

### When Ads Become Profiles: Large-Scale Audit of Algorithmic Biases and   LLM Profiling Risks
**Authors**: Baiyu Chen, Benjamin Tag, Hao Xue, Daniel Angus, Flora Salim

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T10:10:37Z

**Summary**: Automated ad targeting on social media is opaque, creating risks of exploitation and invisibility to external scrutiny. Users may be steered toward harmful content while independent auditing of these processes remains blocked. Large Language Models (LLMs) raise a new concern: the potential to reverse-engineer sensitive user attributes from exposure alone. We introduce a multi-stage auditing framework to investigate these risks. First, a large-scale audit of over 435,000 ad impressions delivered to 891 Australian Facebook users reveals algorithmic biases, including disproportionate Gambling and Politics ads shown to socioeconomically vulnerable and politically aligned groups. Second, a multimodal LLM can reconstruct users' demographic profiles from ad streams, outperforming census-based baselines and matching or exceeding human performance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams constitute rich digital footprints for public AI inference, highlighting urgent privacy risks and the need for content-level auditing and governance.

### On The Reproducibility Limitations of RAG Systems
**Authors**: Baiqiang Wang, Dongfang Zhao, Nathan R Tallent, Luanzheng Guo

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T10:07:29Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is increasingly employed in generative AI-driven scientific workflows to integrate rapidly evolving scientific knowledge bases, yet its reliability is frequently compromised by non-determinism in their retrieval components. This paper introduces ReproRAG, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically measure and quantify the reproducibility of vector-based retrieval systems. ReproRAG investigates sources of uncertainty across the entire pipeline, including different embedding models, precision, retrieval algorithms, hardware configurations, and distributed execution environments. Utilizing a suite of metrics, such as Exact Match Rate, Jaccard Similarity, and Kendall's Tau, the proposed framework effectively characterizes the trade-offs between reproducibility and performance. Our large-scale empirical study reveals critical insights; for instance, we observe that different embedding models have remarkable impact on RAG reproducibility. The open-sourced ReproRAG framework provides researchers and engineers productive tools to validate deployments, benchmark reproducibility, and make informed design decisions, thereby fostering more trustworthy AI for science.

### Memory in Large Language Models: Mechanisms, Evaluation and Evolution
**Authors**: Dianxing Zhang, Wendong Li, Kani Song, Jiaye Lu, Gang Li, Liuchun Yang, Sheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T10:06:58Z

**Summary**: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.

### Conf-Profile: A Confidence-Driven Reasoning Paradigm for Label-Free User   Profiling
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Jianbo Zhao, Xueyu Ren, Jie Tang, Wangjie You, Xu Chen, Kan Zhou, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran, Yuan Meng, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T09:58:37Z

**Summary**: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

### Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection for Large Language Model Generated   Text
**Authors**: Luyan Zhang, Xinyu Xie

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T09:55:42Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection, specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD (Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits (0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

### Prompting for Performance: Exploring LLMs for Configuring Software
**Authors**: Helge Spieker, ThÃ©o Matricon, Nassim Belmecheri, JÃ¸rn Eirik Betten, Gauthier Le Bartz Lyan, Heraldo Borges, Quentin Mazouni, Dennis Gross, Arnaud Gotlieb, Mathieu Acher

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T09:52:43Z

**Summary**: Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size, or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.

### NGRPO: Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Gongrui Nan, Siye Chen, Jing Huang, Mengyu Lu, Dexun Wang, Chunmei Xie, Weiqi Xiong, Xianzhou Zeng, Qixuan Zhou, Yadong Li, Xingzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-23T09:38:10Z

**Summary**: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero, leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning.
