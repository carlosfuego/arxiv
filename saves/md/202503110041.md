**Summary**: Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:47:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DeFT.

**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:54:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. We evaluate Proximity on the MMLU and MedRAG benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining response accuracy. Proximity reduces retrieval latency by up to 59% while maintaining accuracy and lowers the computational burden on the vector database. We also experiment with different similarity thresholds and quantify the trade-off between speed and recall. Our work shows that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Caching for LLM Web Services
**Authors**: Waris Gill, Mohamed Elidrisi, Pallavi Kalapatapu, Ammar Ahmed, Ali Anwar, Muhammad Ali Gulzar

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:49:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Gradient-Optimized Cache
**Authors**: Junxiang Qiu, Lin Liu, Shuo Wang, Jinda Lu, Kezhou Chen, Yanbin Hao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T05:31:47Z

**Summary**: Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements.

### Piccolo: Large-Scale Graph Processing with Fine-Grained In-Memory   Scatter-Gathe
**Authors**: Changmin Shin, Jaeyong Song, Hongsun Jang, Dogeun Kim, Jun Sung, Taehee Kwon, Jae Hyung Ju, Frank Liu, Yeonkyu Choi, Jinho Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T03:27:33Z

**Summary**: Graph processing requires irregular, fine-grained random access patterns incompatible with contemporary off-chip memory architecture, leading to inefficient data access. This inefficiency makes graph processing an extremely memory-bound application. Because of this, existing graph processing accelerators typically employ a graph tiling-based or processing-in-memory (PIM) approach to relieve the memory bottleneck. In the tiling-based approach, a graph is split into chunks that fit within the on-chip cache to maximize data reuse. In the PIM approach, arithmetic units are placed within memory to perform operations such as reduction or atomic addition. However, both approaches have several limitations, especially when implemented on current memory standards (i.e., DDR). Because the access granularity provided by DDR is much larger than that of the graph vertex property data, much of the bandwidth and cache capacity are wasted. PIM is meant to alleviate such issues, but it is difficult to use in conjunction with the tiling-based approach, resulting in a significant disadvantage. Furthermore, placing arithmetic units inside a memory chip is expensive, thereby supporting multiple types of operation is thought to be impractical. To address the above limitations, we present Piccolo, an end-to-end efficient graph processing accelerator with fine-grained in-memory random scatter-gather. Instead of placing expensive arithmetic units in off-chip memory, Piccolo focuses on reducing the off-chip traffic with non-arithmetic function-in-memory of random scatter-gather. To fully benefit from in-memory scatter-gather, Piccolo redesigns the cache and MHA of the accelerator such that it can enjoy both the advantage of tiling and in-memory operations. Piccolo achieves a maximum speedup of 3.28$\times$ and a geometric mean speedup of 1.62$\times$ across various and extensive benchmarks.

### LVLM-Compress-Bench: Benchmarking the Broader Impact of Large   Vision-Language Model Compression
**Authors**: Souvik Kundu, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Sungduk Yu, Phillip Howard, Tiep Le, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, David Cobbley, Hao Kang, Vasudev Lal

**Updated**: 2025-03-06T21:21:18Z

**Summary**: Despite recent efforts in understanding the compression impact on large language models (LLMs) in terms of their downstream task performance and trustworthiness on relatively simpler uni-modal benchmarks (for example, question answering, common sense reasoning), their detailed study on multi-modal Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is yet to be unveiled. Towards mitigating this gap, we present LVLM-Compress-Bench, a framework to first thoroughly study the broad impact of compression on the generative performance of LVLMs with multi-modal input driven tasks. In specific, we consider two major classes of compression for autoregressive models, namely KV cache and weight compression, for the dynamically growing intermediate cache and static weights, respectively.   We use four LVLM variants of the popular LLaVA framework to present our analysis via integrating various state-of-the-art KV and weight compression methods including uniform, outlier-reduced, and group quantization for the KV cache and weights. With this framework we demonstrate on ten different multi-modal datasets with different capabilities including recognition, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, visual reasoning, hallucination and visual illusion identification, toxicity, stereotypes and bias. In specific, our framework demonstrates the compression impact on both general and ethically critical metrics leveraging a combination of real world and synthetic datasets to encompass diverse societal intersectional attributes. Extensive experimental evaluations yield diverse and intriguing observations on the behavior of LVLMs at different quantization budget of KV and weights, in both maintaining and losing performance as compared to the baseline model with FP16 data format.   Code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/opengear-project/LVLM-compress-bench.

### Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge   Reasoning
**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Orion Weller, Fabio Petroni, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2025-03-06T21:07:41Z

**Summary**: Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.

### Markov Chain of Thought for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Wen Yang, Minpeng Liao, Kai Fan

**Updated**: 2025-03-06T06:39:56Z

**Summary**: Chain of Thought (CoT) of multi-step benefits from the logical structure of the reasoning steps and task-specific actions, significantly enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. As the prevalence of long CoT, the number of reasoning steps exceeds manageable token limits and leads to higher computational demands. Inspired by the fundamental logic of human cognition, "derive, then reduce", we conceptualize the standard multi-step CoT as a novel Markov Chain of Thought (MCoT). In this study, we consider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text accompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path, self-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our MCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question, enabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache. In our experiments, we curate the $\texttt{MCoTInstruct}$ dataset, and the empirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency but also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this work paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/james-yw/Markov-Chain-of-Thought

### TUNA: Tuning Unstable and Noisy Cloud Applications
**Authors**: Johannes Freischuetz, Konstantinos Kanellis, Brian Kroth, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T20:36:51Z

**Summary**: Autotuning plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance of systems, particularly in large-scale cloud deployments. One of the main challenges in performing autotuning in the cloud arises from performance variability. We first investigate the extent to which noise slows autotuning and find that as little as $5\%$ noise can lead to a $2.5$x slowdown in converging to the best-performing configuration. We measure the magnitude of noise in cloud computing settings and find that while some components (CPU, disk) have almost no performance variability, there are still sources of significant variability (caches, memory). Furthermore, variability leads to autotuning finding unstable configurations. As many as $63.3\%$ of the configurations selected as "best" during tuning can have their performance degrade by $30\%$ or more when deployed. Using this as motivation, we propose a novel approach to improve the efficiency of autotuning systems by (a) detecting and removing outlier configurations and (b) using ML-based approaches to provide a more stable true signal of de-noised experiment results to the optimizer. The resulting system, TUNA (Tuning Unstable and Noisy Cloud Applications) enables faster convergence and robust configurations. Tuning postgres running mssales, an enterprise production workload, we find that TUNA can lead to $1.88$x lower running time on average with $2.58x$ lower standard deviation compared to traditional sampling methodologies.

### GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera   Control
**Authors**: Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Jiahui Huang, Huan Ling, Yifan Lu, Merlin Nimier-David, Thomas MÃ¼ller, Alexander Keller, Sanja Fidler, Jun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/

### Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach
**Authors**: Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Yang Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Yehui Tang, Xudong Lu, Zhihang Liu, Yun Zheng, Yu Liu, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-08T14:48:15Z

**Summary**: Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights will be released shortly, so please stay tuned for updates!

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

### StableToolBench: Towards Stable Large-Scale Benchmarking on Tool   Learning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhicheng Guo, Sijie Cheng, Hao Wang, Shihao Liang, Yujia Qin, Peng Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:39:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, prompting the exploration of tool learning, which integrates LLMs with external tools to address diverse real-world challenges. Assessing the capability of LLMs to utilise tools necessitates large-scale and stable benchmarks. However, previous works relied on either hand-crafted online tools with limited scale, or large-scale real online APIs suffering from instability of API status. To address this problem, we introduce StableToolBench, a benchmark evolving from ToolBench, proposing a virtual API server and stable evaluation system. The virtual API server contains a caching system and API simulators which are complementary to alleviate the change in API status. Meanwhile, the stable evaluation system designs solvable pass and win rates using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator to eliminate the randomness during evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability of StableToolBench, and further discuss the effectiveness of API simulators, the caching system, and the evaluator system.

### Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large Language Model Training Through   Chronos-aware Pipeline Parallelism
**Authors**: Xinyuan Lin, Chenlu Li, Zongle Huang, Chunyu Wang, Bo Xiao, Huazhong Yang, Shishi Duan, Yongpan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T04:54:50Z

**Summary**: Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.

### InfiniSST: Simultaneous Translation of Unbounded Speech with Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T19:51:29Z

**Summary**: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

### Q-Filters: Leveraging QK Geometry for Efficient KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Nathan Godey, Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini, Ãric de la Clergerie, BenoÃ®t Sagot

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T17:37:49Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids re-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model sizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory bottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during generation. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and Key (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores without computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV Cache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on a single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives, Q-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct access to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings demonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression methods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming efficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups. Notably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task with a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by up to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.

### Efficient and Optimal No-Regret Caching under Partial Observation
**Authors**: Younes Ben Mazziane, Francescomaria Faticanti, Sara Alouf, Giovanni Neglia

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T16:21:33Z

**Summary**: Online learning algorithms have been successfully used to design caching policies with sublinear regret in the total number of requests, with no statistical assumption about the request sequence. Most existing algorithms involve computationally expensive operations and require knowledge of all past requests. However, this may not be feasible in practical scenarios like caching at a cellular base station. Therefore, we study the caching problem in a more restrictive setting where only a fraction of past requests are observed, and we propose a randomized caching policy with sublinear regret based on the classic online learning algorithm Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL). Our caching policy is the first to attain the asymptotically optimal regret bound while ensuring asymptotically constant amortized time complexity in the partial observability setting of requests. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed solution against classic caching policies and validates the proposed approach under synthetic and real-world request traces.

### Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code
**Authors**: Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T13:01:07Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.

### Q&C: When Quantization Meets Cache in Efficient Image Generation
**Authors**: Xin Ding, Xin Li, Haotong Qin, Zhibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T11:19:02Z

**Summary**: Quantization and cache mechanisms are typically applied individually for efficient Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), each demonstrating notable potential for acceleration. However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability. The code will be available at https://github.com/xinding-sys/Quant-Cache.

**Authors**: Emese Sziklay, TamÃ¡s Jursonovics

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T11:15:47Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a summary analysis of the Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Perfect Least Frequently Used (PLFU) cache eviction algorithms on real data, transferred on Content Delivery Nettworks (CDNs), as well as on Zipf distributed samples. In light of the growing emphasis on energy efficiency in CDNs in recent years due to rising energy costs, this paper considers and discusses the total CPU time required to run a cache algorithm. The total CPU time represents a novel metric for evaluating cache performance, and it is contrasted with the conventional Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) metric. Furthermore, a new algorithm with an admission policy and the eviction strategy that of PLFU is presented. The results demonstrate that it is a simple and straightforward algorithm to implement and offers high CHR and low CPU time.

### PersonaX: A Recommendation Agent Oriented User Modeling Framework for   Long Behavior Sequence
**Authors**: Yunxiao Shi, Wujiang Xu, Zeqi Zhang, Xing Zi, Qiang Wu, Min Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T08:41:40Z

**Summary**: Recommendation agents leverage large language models for user modeling LLM UM to construct textual personas guiding alignment with real users. However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality. Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent. PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.

**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Xinhao Luo, Junxian Guo, Wentao Ni, Yangjie Zhou, Yue Guan, Cong Guo, Weihao Cui, Yu Feng, Minyi Guo, Yuhao Zhu, Minjia Zhang, Jingwen Leng, Chen Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T03:18:56Z

**Summary**: In this work, we design and implement VQ-LLM, an efficient fused Vector Quantization (VQ) kernel generation framework. We first introduce a software abstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and support the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache adaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy, including off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers. Centered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine that optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This compute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations. Additionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in our optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an average latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared to existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36% to 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization methods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable, achieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent bit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy.

### RefreshKV: Updating Small KV Cache During Long-form Generation
**Authors**: Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T18:23:47Z

**Summary**: Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input is a very compute-intensive inference scenario for large language models (LLMs). One prominent inference speed-up approach is to construct a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show that continued pretraining with our inference setting brings further gains in performance.

### EliteKV: Scalable KV Cache Compression via RoPE Frequency Selection and   Joint Low-Rank Projection
**Authors**: Yuhao Zhou, Sirui Song, Boyang Liu, Zhiheng Xi, Senjie Jin, Xiaoran Fan, Zhihao Zhang, Wei Li, Xuanjing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T14:26:51Z

**Summary**: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) enables each attention head to capture multi-frequency information along the sequence dimension and is widely applied in foundation models. However, the nonlinearity introduced by RoPE complicates optimization of the key state in the Key-Value (KV) cache for RoPE-based attention. Existing KV cache compression methods typically store key state before rotation and apply the transformation during decoding, introducing additional computational overhead. This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible modification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache compression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference of each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain dimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint low-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing. Experimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\%$ of the original training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\%$ reduction in KV cache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin. Furthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different scales within the same family.

**Authors**: Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh, Aleksandar Bojchevski, Evangelos Eleftheriou, Martino Dazzi

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T12:43:06Z

**Summary**: One of the challenges of quantizing a large language model (LLM) is the presence of outliers. Outliers often make uniform quantization schemes less effective, particularly in extreme cases such as 4-bit quantization. We introduce KurTail, a new post-training quantization (PTQ) scheme that leverages Kurtosis-based rotation to mitigate outliers in the activations of LLMs. Our method optimizes Kurtosis as a measure of tailedness. This approach enables the quantization of weights, activations, and the KV cache in 4 bits. We utilize layer-wise optimization, ensuring memory efficiency. KurTail outperforms existing quantization methods, offering a 13.3\% boost in MMLU accuracy and a 15.5\% drop in Wiki perplexity compared to QuaRot. It also outperforms SpinQuant with a 2.6\% MMLU gain and reduces perplexity by 2.9\%, all while reducing the training cost. For comparison, learning the rotation using SpinQuant for Llama3-70B requires at least four NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs, whereas our method requires only a single GPU, making it a more accessible solution for consumer GPU.

**Authors**: Hongguang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T09:38:20Z

**Summary**: Stencil computation is essential in high-performance computing, especially for large-scale tasks like liquid simulation and weather forecasting. Optimizing its performance can reduce both energy consumption and computation time, which is critical in disaster prediction. This paper explores optimization techniques for 7-point 3D stencil computation on ARM's Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), using the Roofline model and tools like Gem5 and cacti. We evaluate software optimizations such as vectorization and tiling, as well as hardware adjustments in ARM SVE vector lengths and cache configurations. The study also examines performance, power consumption, and chip area trade-offs to identify optimal configurations for ARM-based systems.

### WeightedKV: Attention Scores Weighted Key-Value Cache Merging for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Jian Yuan, Ziwei He, Haoli Bai, Jingwen Leng, Bo Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T09:12:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) use key-value (KV) cache to reduce redundant computation in autoregressive generation. However, the KV cache size increases linearly during generation, leading to excessive memory usage, especially for long texts. Most KV cache compression methods evict the unimportant KV pairs to maintain a fixed cache size, which leads to the permanent loss of tokens during generation. However, singular value decomposition shows that \textit{values} do not exhibit a strong low-rank property as \textit{keys} do, suggesting that information is distributed more evenly across \textit{values}, in contrast to its more redundant distribution within \textit{keys}. Therefore, methods that evict both \textit{keys} and \textit{values} risk losing crucial information and compromise context integrity, ultimately degrading the output quality. To address this problem, we propose WeightedKV, a novel, training-free approach that discards the \textit{keys} of less important tokens, while merging their \textit{values} into neighboring tokens via a convex combination weighted by their average attention scores. In this way, the retained \textit{keys} serve as anchors that guide the generation process, while the merged \textit{values} provide a rich contextual backdrop. We assess our method on four widely used language modeling datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to all baseline methods, particularly with a lower budget ratio.

### CacheQuant: Comprehensively Accelerated Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Xuewen Liu, Zhikai Li, Qingyi Gu

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T09:04:51Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have gradually gained prominence in the field of image synthesis, showcasing remarkable generative capabilities. Nevertheless, the slow inference and complex networks, resulting from redundancy at both temporal and structural levels, hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Current acceleration methods for diffusion models focus separately on temporal and structural levels. However, independent optimization at each level to further push the acceleration limits results in significant performance degradation. On the other hand, integrating optimizations at both levels can compound the acceleration effects. Unfortunately, we find that the optimizations at these two levels are not entirely orthogonal. Performing separate optimizations and then simply integrating them results in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle this issue, we propose CacheQuant, a novel training-free paradigm that comprehensively accelerates diffusion models by jointly optimizing model caching and quantization techniques. Specifically, we employ a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal cache schedule, in which the properties of caching and quantization are carefully considered to minimize errors. Additionally, we propose decoupled error correction to further mitigate the coupled and accumulated errors step by step. Experimental results show that CacheQuant achieves a 5.18 speedup and 4 compression for Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.02 loss in CLIP score. Our code are open-sourced: https://github.com/BienLuky/CacheQuant .

### DCI: A Coordinated Allocation and Filling Workload-Aware Dual-Cache   Allocation GNN Inference Acceleration System
**Authors**: Yi Luo, Yaobin Wang, Qi Wang, Yingchen Song, Huan Wu, Qingfeng Wang, Jun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T08:06:55Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for processing graph-structured data, increasingly used for large-scale real-world graphs via sampling-based inference methods. However, inherent characteristics of neighbor sampling lead to redundant data loading during GNN inference, compounded by inefficient data transfers between host and GPU memory, resulting in slow inference and low resource utilization. Existing methods to accelerate GNN inference face several challenges: (1) low practical GPU memory utilization, (2) overlooking adjacency matrix locality, and (3) long preprocessing time. To address these challenges, we introduce DCI, an efficient workload-aware dual-cache allocation system for GNN inference acceleration. DCI allocates cache capacities for both node features and adjacency matrices based on workload patterns during the pre-sampling phase, leveraging a lightweight cache-filling algorithm to optimize data loading efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DCI accelerates sampling and node feature loading, achieving end-to-end inference speedups of 1.18$\times$ to 11.26$\times$ compared to DGL, and 1.14$\times$ to 13.68$\times$ over RAIN, while reducing preprocessing time by 52.8\% to 98.7\%. Additionally, DCI outperforms state-of-the-art single-cache inference systems by achieving speedup of 1.08$\times$ to 1.32$\times$. We also compared DCI with DUCATI's dual-cache population strategy. Our lightweight population algorithm allows DCI to achieve nearly the same inference speed while keeping preprocessing time to less than 20\% of that required by DUCATI.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T05:49:41Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven growing demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### Dialogue Without Limits: Constant-Sized KV Caches for Extended Responses   in LLMs
**Authors**: Ravi Ghadia, Avinash Kumar, Gaurav Jain, Prashant Nair, Poulami Das

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T18:12:50Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive Transformers rely on Key-Value (KV) caching to accelerate inference. However, the linear growth of the KV cache with context length leads to excessive memory consumption and bandwidth constraints. This bottleneck is particularly problematic in real-time applications -- such as chatbots and interactive assistants -- where low latency and high memory efficiency are critical. Existing methods drop distant tokens or compress states in a lossy manner, sacrificing accuracy by discarding vital context or introducing bias.   We propose MorphKV, an inference-time technique that maintains a constant-sized KV cache while preserving accuracy. MorphKV balances long-range dependencies and local coherence during text generation. It eliminates early-token bias while retaining high-fidelity context by adaptively ranking tokens through correlation-aware selection. Unlike heuristic retention or lossy compression, MorphKV iteratively refines the KV cache via lightweight updates guided by attention patterns of recent tokens. This approach captures inter-token correlation with greater accuracy, crucial for tasks like content creation and code generation. Our studies on long-response tasks show 52.9$\%$ memory savings and 18.2$\%$ higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art prior works, enabling efficient real-world deployment.

### When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View
**Authors**: Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T14:37:53Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

### MoSFormer: Augmenting Temporal Context with Memory of Surgery for   Surgical Phase Recognition
**Authors**: Hao Ding, Xu Lian, Mathias Unberath

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T02:26:21Z

**Summary**: Surgical phase recognition from video enables various downstream applications. Transformer-based sliding window approaches have set the state-of-the-art by capturing rich spatial-temporal features. However, while transformers can theoretically handle arbitrary-length sequences, in practice they are limited by memory and compute constraints, resulting in fixed context windows that struggle with maintaining temporal consistency across lengthy surgical procedures. This often leads to fragmented predictions and limited procedure-level understanding. To address these challenges, we propose Memory of Surgery (MoS), a framework that enriches temporal modeling by incorporating both semantic interpretable long-term surgical history and short-term impressions. MoSFormer, our enhanced transformer architecture, integrates MoS using a carefully designed encoding and fusion mechanism. We further introduce step filtering to refine history representation and develop a memory caching pipeline to improve training and inference stability, mitigating shortcut learning and overfitting. MoSFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. On the Challenging BernBypass70 benchmark, it attains 88.0 video-level accuracy and phase-level metrics of 70.7 precision, 68.7 recall, and 66.3 F1 score, outperforming its baseline with 2.1 video-level accuracy and phase-level metrics of 4.6 precision, 3.6 recall, and 3.8 F1 score. Further studies confirms the individual and combined benefits of long-term and short-term memory components through ablation and counterfactual inference. Qualitative results shows improved temporal consistency. The augmented temporal context enables procedure-level understanding, paving the way for more comprehensive surgical video analysis.

### IterGen: Iterative Semantic-aware Structured LLM Generation with   Backtracking
**Authors**: Shubham Ugare, Rohan Gumaste, Tarun Suresh, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T01:39:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks such as natural language and code generation, but their outputs often suffer from issues like hallucination, toxicity, and incorrect results. Current libraries for structured LLM generation rely on left-to-right decoding without support for backtracking, limiting the ability to correct or refine outputs mid-generation.   To address this, we introduce IterGen, a user-friendly library for iterative, grammar-guided LLM generation that enables users to move both forward and backward within the generated output based on grammar symbols. By leveraging a symbol-to-position mapping and maintaining the key-value (KV) cache state, IterGen ensures efficient and structured generation while allowing for corrections during the process. We demonstrate IterGen's effectiveness in two important applications: reducing privacy leakage in LLM outputs and improving the accuracy of LLM-generated SQL and Vega-Lite queries.   Our code and additional resources are available at https://structuredllm.com.

### Streaming Video Question-Answering with In-context Video KV-Cache   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shangzhe Di, Zhelun Yu, Guanghao Zhang, Haoyuan Li, Tao Zhong, Hao Cheng, Bolin Li, Wanggui He, Fangxun Shu, Hao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T15:53:33Z

**Summary**: We propose ReKV, a novel training-free approach that enables efficient streaming video question-answering (StreamingVQA), by seamlessly integrating with existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Traditional VideoQA systems struggle with long videos, as they must process entire videos before responding to queries, and repeat this process for each new question. In contrast, our approach analyzes long videos in a streaming manner, allowing for prompt responses as soon as user queries are received. Building on a common Video-LLM, we first incorporate a sliding-window attention mechanism, ensuring that input frames attend to a limited number of preceding frames, thereby reducing computational overhead. To prevent information loss, we store processed video key-value caches (KV-Caches) in RAM and disk, reloading them into GPU memory as needed. Additionally, we introduce a retrieval method that leverages an external retriever or the parameters within Video-LLMs to retrieve only query-relevant KV-Caches, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in question answering. ReKV enables the separation of video encoding and question-answering across different processes and GPUs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of StreamingVQA. Through comprehensive experimentation, we validate the efficacy and practicality of our approach, which significantly boosts efficiency and enhances applicability over existing VideoQA models.

### Progressive Sparse Attention: Algorithm and System Co-design for   Efficient Attention in LLM Serving
**Authors**: Qihui Zhou, Peiqi Yin, Pengfei Zuo, James Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T07:56:42Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). However, serving long-context LLMs comes with significant inference costs due to the high memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing work leverages dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAes) to mitigate the KV cache overhead, but these algorithms rely on top-$k$ KV cache selection, which results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. A larger $k$ improves accuracy but decreases efficiency, while a smaller $k$ boosts efficiency but compromises accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, this paper presents PSA, a $\underline{P}$rogressive $\underline{S}$parse $\underline{A}$ttention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with system co-design to achieve both high inference accuracy and improved efficiency in LLM serving. The PSA algorithm adaptively adjusts the KV cache budget of different tokens and layers according to their real attention weight distributions, rather than relying on a fixed budget $k$. This enables high accuracy while minimizing KV cache usage. To further enhance execution efficiency, we introduce a pipelined iteration scheme that reduces CPU-GPU interleaving and synchronization overhead during PSA computation. Additionally, we implement unified GPU memory management that optimizes PSA's memory utilization by accounting for uneven memory requirements across different model layers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSA reduces KV cache usage for attention computation by up to 2.4$\times$ and 8.8$\times$, and increases end-to-end serving throughput by up to 1.4$\times$ and 2.0$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art DSAes and systems without sparse attention, respectively.

### A Unified Framework for Automated Code Transformation and Pragma   Insertion
**Authors**: StÃ©phane Pouget, Louis-NoÃ«l Pouchet, Jason Cong

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T05:43:19Z

**Summary**: High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an approach for privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML), enabling model training across multiple clients without centralized data collection. With an aggregator server coordinating training, aggregating model updates, and storing metadata across rounds. In addition to training, a substantial part of FL systems are the non-training workloads such as scheduling, personalization, clustering, debugging, and incentivization. Most existing systems rely on the aggregator to handle non-training workloads and use cloud services for data storage. This results in high latency and increased costs as non-training workloads rely on large volumes of metadata, including weight parameters from client updates, hyperparameters, and aggregated updates across rounds, making the situation even worse. We propose FLStore, a serverless framework for efficient FL non-training workloads and storage. FLStore unifies the data and compute planes on a serverless cache, enabling locality-aware execution via tailored caching policies to reduce latency and costs. Per our evaluations, compared to cloud object store based aggregator server FLStore reduces per request average latency by 71% and costs by 92.45%, with peak improvements of 99.7% and 98.8%, respectively. Compared to an in-memory cloud cache based aggregator server, FLStore reduces average latency by 64.6% and costs by 98.83%, with peak improvements of 98.8% and 99.6%, respectively. FLStore integrates seamlessly with existing FL frameworks with minimal modifications, while also being fault-tolerant and highly scalable.

### Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T18:04:52Z

**Summary**: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

### Distributed Data Access in Industrial Edge Networks
**Authors**: Theofanis P. Raptis, Andrea Passarella, Marco Conti

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T14:54:35Z

**Summary**: Wireless edge networks in smart industrial environments increasingly operate using advanced sensors and autonomous machines interacting with each other and generating huge amounts of data. Those huge amounts of data are bound to make data management (e.g., for processing, storing, computing) a big challenge. Current data management approaches, relying primarily on centralized data storage, might not be able to cope with the scalability and real time requirements of Industry 4.0 environments, while distributed solutions are increasingly being explored. In this paper, we introduce the problem of distributed data access in multi-hop wireless industrial edge deployments, whereby a set of consumer nodes needs to access data stored in a set of data cache nodes, satisfying the industrial data access delay requirements and at the same time maximizing the network lifetime. We prove that the introduced problem is computationally intractable and, after formulating the objective function, we design a two-step algorithm in order to address it. We use an open testbed with real devices for conducting an experimental investigation on the performance of the algorithm. Then, we provide two online improvements, so that the data distribution can dynamically change before the first node in the network runs out of energy. We compare the performance of the methods via simulations for different numbers of network nodes and data consumers, and we show significant lifetime prolongation and increased energy efficiency when employing the method which is using only decentralized low-power wireless communication instead of the method which is using also centralized local area wireless communication.

### Training-free and Adaptive Sparse Attention for Efficient Long Video   Generation
**Authors**: Yifei Xia, Suhan Ling, Fangcheng Fu, Yujie Wang, Huixia Li, Xuefeng Xiao, Bin Cui

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T14:11:20Z

**Summary**: Generating high-fidelity long videos with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is often hindered by significant latency, primarily due to the computational demands of attention mechanisms. For instance, generating an 8-second 720p video (110K tokens) with HunyuanVideo takes about 600 PFLOPs, with around 500 PFLOPs consumed by attention computations. To address this issue, we propose AdaSpa, the first Dynamic Pattern and Online Precise Search sparse attention method. Firstly, to realize the Dynamic Pattern, we introduce a blockified pattern to efficiently capture the hierarchical sparsity inherent in DiTs. This is based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit hierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities. This blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention computation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly, to enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with Head-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by our finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and heads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this invariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and allows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal overhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can be integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional fine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate that AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while preserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach to efficient video generation.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T13:23:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.

### Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache
**Authors**: Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T13:08:44Z

**Summary**: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

### Towards Reliable Vector Database Management Systems: A Software Testing   Roadmap for 2030
**Authors**: Shenao Wang, Yanjie Zhao, Yinglin Xie, Zhao Liu, Xinyi Hou, Quanchen Zou, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T07:56:37Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-driven applications has propelled Vector Database Management Systems (VDBMSs) into the spotlight as a critical infrastructure component. VDBMS specializes in storing, indexing, and querying dense vector embeddings, enabling advanced LLM capabilities such as retrieval-augmented generation, long-term memory, and caching mechanisms. However, the explosive adoption of VDBMS has outpaced the development of rigorous software testing methodologies tailored for these emerging systems. Unlike traditional databases optimized for structured data, VDBMS face unique testing challenges stemming from the high-dimensional nature of vector data, the fuzzy semantics in vector search, and the need to support dynamic data scaling and hybrid query processing. In this paper, we begin by conducting an empirical study of VDBMS defects and identify key challenges in test input generation, oracle definition, and test evaluation. Drawing from these insights, we propose the first comprehensive research roadmap for developing effective testing methodologies tailored to VDBMS. By addressing these challenges, the software testing community can contribute to the development of more reliable and trustworthy VDBMS, enabling the full potential of LLMs and data-intensive AI applications.

### Cache-of-Thought: Master-Apprentice Framework for Cost-Effective Vision   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Mingyuan Wu, Jize Jiang, Haozhen Zheng, Meitang Li, Zhaoheng Li, Beitong Tian, Bo Chen, Yongjoo Park, Minjia Zhang, Chengxiang Zhai, Klara Nahrstedt

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T23:09:20Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of vision applications of increasing complexity and scales, yet choosing the right VLM model size involves a trade-off between response quality and cost. While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU.   In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general VQA benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall VQA performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%.

### WWW: What, When, Where to Compute-in-Memory
**Authors**: Tanvi Sharma, Mustafa Ali, Indranil Chakraborty, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T21:50:48Z

**Summary**: Matrix multiplication is the dominant computation during Machine Learning (ML) inference. To efficiently perform such multiplication operations, Compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigms have emerged as a highly energy efficient solution. However, integrating compute in memory poses key questions, such as 1) What type of CiM to use: Given a multitude of CiM design characteristics, determining their suitability from architecture perspective is needed. 2) When to use CiM: ML inference includes workloads with a variety of memory and compute requirements, making it difficult to identify when CiM is more beneficial than standard processing cores. 3) Where to integrate CiM: Each memory level has different bandwidth and capacity, creating different data reuse opportunities for CiM integration.   To answer such questions regarding on-chip CiM integration for accelerating ML workloads, we use an analytical architecture-evaluation methodology with tailored mapping algorithm. The mapping algorithm aims to achieve highest weight reuse and reduced data movements for a given CiM prototype and workload. Our analysis considers the integration of CiM prototypes into the cache levels of a tensor-core-like architecture, and shows that CiM integrated memory improves energy efficiency by up to 3.4x and throughput by up to 15.6x compared to established baseline with INT-8 precision. We believe the proposed work provides insights into what type of CiM to use, and when and where to optimally integrate it in the cache hierarchy for efficient matrix multiplication.

### An Attempt to Catch Up with JIT Compilers: The False Lead of Optimizing   Inline Caches
**Authors**: Aurore Poirier, Erven Rohou, Manuel Serrano

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T21:42:49Z

**Summary**: Context: Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers are able to specialize the code they generate according to a continuous profiling of the running programs. This gives them an advantage when compared to Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilers that must choose the code to generate once for all.   Inquiry: Is it possible to improve the performance of AoT compilers by adding Dynamic Binary Modification (DBM) to the executions?   Approach: We added to the Hopc AoT JavaScript compiler a new optimization based on DBM to the inline cache (IC), a classical optimization dynamic languages use to implement object property accesses efficiently.   Knowledge: Reducing the number of memory accesses as the new optimization does, does not shorten execution times on contemporary architectures.   Grounding: The DBM optimization we have implemented is fully operational on x86_64 architectures. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate its impact on performance and to study the reasons of the lack of acceleration.   Importance: The (negative) result we present in this paper sheds new light on the best strategy to be used to implement dynamic languages. It tells that the old days were removing instructions or removing memory reads always yielded to speed up is over. Nowadays, implementing sophisticated compiler optimizations is only worth the effort if the processor is not able by itself to accelerate the code. This result applies to AoT compilers as well as JIT compilers.

### Long-Context Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Guanzheng Chen, Qilong Feng, Jinjie Ni, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:59:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups. Our analyses reveal that RAPID achieves robust acceleration beyond 32K context length and demonstrates superior generation quality in real-world applications.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:29:03Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. Our code has been made available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/ThinK.

### Persistent Sampling: Enhancing the Efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Minas Karamanis, UroÅ¡ Seljak

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:15:38Z

**Summary**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.

### Dynamic Parallel Tree Search for Efficient LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yifu Ding, Wentao Jiang, Shunyu Liu, Yongcheng Jing, Jinyang Guo, Yingjie Wang, Jing Zhang, Zengmao Wang, Ziwei Liu, Bo Du, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T06:39:06Z

**Summary**: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T03:22:41Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling
**Authors**: Lefan Zhang, Xiaodan Wang, Yanhua Huang, Ruiwen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T11:47:58Z

**Summary**: Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%. The code is available at https://github.com/HArmonizedSS/HASS.

### Faster Diffusion via Temporal Attention Decomposition
**Authors**: Haozhe Liu, Wentian Zhang, Jinheng Xie, Francesco Faccio, Mengmeng Xu, Tao Xiang, Mike Zheng Shou, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua, JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T10:49:33Z

**Summary**: We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.

### From Hours to Minutes: Lossless Acceleration of Ultra Long Sequence   Generation up to 100K Tokens
**Authors**: Tong Wu, Junzhe Shen, Zixia Jia, Yuxuan Wang, Zilong Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T07:10:08Z

**Summary**: Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths. Code can be found at https://github.com/bigai-nlco/TokenSwift.

**Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T02:48:22Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

**Authors**: Weiming Hu, Haoyan Zhang, Cong Guo, Yu Feng, Renyang Guan, Zhendong Hua, Zihan Liu, Yue Guan, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T02:16:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer applications. The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained group-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values in a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy without retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy LLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data types to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the required bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key finding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small groups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level diversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data types fail to provide.   In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type, featuring a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data distribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address these challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign the appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically generated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for real-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time quantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element (PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit. By integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the group-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated challenges. Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x) speedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM accelerator.

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T13:03:44Z

**Summary**: User-facing applications running in modern datacenters exhibit irregular request patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight latency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy conserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time from a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring the core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state by keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also remains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops) seamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power consumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level to minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further cutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost. Our evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.

### Accelerating Graph Indexing for ANNS on Modern CPUs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Wang, Haotian Wu, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yifan Zhu, Wenchao Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T11:36:43Z

**Summary**: In high-dimensional vector spaces, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key component in database and artificial intelligence infrastructures. Graph-based methods, particularly HNSW, have emerged as leading solutions among various ANNS approaches, offering an impressive trade-off between search efficiency and accuracy. Many modern vector databases utilize graph indexes as their core algorithms, benefiting from various optimizations to enhance search performance. However, the high indexing time associated with graph algorithms poses a significant challenge, especially given the increasing volume of data, query processing complexity, and dynamic index maintenance demand. This has rendered indexing time a critical performance metric for users. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the underlying causes of the low graph indexing efficiency on modern CPUs, identifying that distance computation dominates indexing time, primarily due to high memory access latency and suboptimal arithmetic operation efficiency. We demonstrate that distance comparisons during index construction can be effectively performed using compact vector codes at an appropriate compression error. Drawing from insights gained through integrating existing compact coding methods in the graph indexing process, we propose a novel compact coding strategy, named Flash, designed explicitly for graph indexing and optimized for modern CPU architectures. By minimizing random memory accesses and maximizing the utilization of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, Flash significantly enhances cache hit rates and arithmetic operations. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets, ranging from ten million to one billion vectors, exhibit that Flash achieves a speedup of 10.4$\times$ to 22.9$\times$ in index construction efficiency, while maintaining or improving search performance.

### KV-Edit: Training-Free Image Editing for Precise Background Preservation
**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Jiawei Shao, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T09:42:11Z

**Summary**: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

### KVTuner: Sensitivity-Aware Layer-wise Mixed Precision KV Cache   Quantization for Efficient and Nearly Lossless LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T03:42:15Z

**Summary**: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations are available at https://github.com/cmd2001/KVTuner.

**Authors**: Viraj Thakkar, Qi Lin, Kenanya Keandra Adriel Prasetyo, Raden Haryosatyo Wisjnunandono, Achmad Imam Kistijantoro, Reza Fuad Rachmadi, Zhichao Cao

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T19:48:48Z

**Summary**: Log-Structured Merge-tree-based Key-Value Store (LSM-KVS) is a foundational storage engine serving diverse modern workloads, systems, and applications. To suit varying use cases, LSM-KVS allows a vast configuration space that controls core parameters like compaction, flush, and cache sizes, each consuming a shared pool of CPU, Memory, and Storage resources. Navigating the LSM-KVS configuration space necessitates knowledge of the impact of each configuration on the expected workload and underlying hardware. Beyond expensive and time-intensive human-expert-based tuning, existing LSM-KVS tuning solutions focus on tuning with specific workload expectations while limited to a narrow subset of parameters.   This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems. ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS. ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads. Through detailed evaluation using RocksDB under several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14X our YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.

### MEDA: Dynamic KV Cache Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Hui Shen, Xin Wang, Che Liu, Zheda Mai, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T19:34:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long text-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their multimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths, challenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in both text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations across layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies for layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic layer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context inference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to determine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically allocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection scheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that merges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the entire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82 times faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on various multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and long-video scenarios. Our code is released at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/MEDA.

**Authors**: Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:53:31Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.

### GTX: A Write-Optimized Latch-free Graph Data System with Transactional   Support -- Extended Version
**Authors**: Libin Zhou, Lu Xing, Yeasir Rayhan, Walid. G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:51:48Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces GTX, a standalone main-memory write-optimized graph data system that specializes in structural and graph property updates while enabling concurrent reads and graph analytics through ACID transactions. Recent graph systems target concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing transaction semantics. However, their performance suffers from updates with real-world temporal locality over the same vertices and edges due to vertex-centric lock contentions. GTX has an adaptive delta-chain locking protocol on top of a carefully designed latch-free graph storage. It eliminates vertex-level locking contention, and adapts to real-life workloads while maintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. GTX's transactions further support cache-friendly block level concurrency control, and cooperative group commit and garbage collection. This combination of features ensures high update throughput and provides low-latency graph analytics. Based on experimental evaluation, in addition to not sacrificing the performance of read-heavy analytical workloads, and having competitive performance similar to state-of-the-art systems, GTX has high read-write transaction throughput. For write-heavy transactional workloads, GTX achieves up to 11x better transaction throughput than the best-performing state-of-the-art system.

### Evaluating IOMMU-Based Shared Virtual Addressing for RISC-V Embedded   Heterogeneous SoCs
**Authors**: Cyril Koenig, Enrico Zelioli, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:26:22Z

**Summary**: Embedded heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoCs) rely on domain-specific hardware accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency. In particular, programmable multi-core accelerators feature a cluster of processing elements and tightly coupled scratchpad memories to balance performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In embedded systems running a general-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically addressed memory regions. This negatively impacts memory utilization and performance by requiring a copy from the virtual host address to the physical accelerator address space. Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs) overcome this limitation by allowing devices and hosts to use a shared virtual paged address space. However, resolving IO virtual addresses can be particularly costly on high-latency memory systems as it requires up to three sequential memory accesses on IOTLB miss. In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous embedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V SoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated the system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute kernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP programming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and accelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show that IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the accelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high memory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache, this IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same conditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable for such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T15:42:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM   Compression Preserve?
**Authors**: Zhenheng Tang, Xiang Liu, Qian Wang, Peijie Dong, Bingsheng He, Xiaowen Chu, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T15:39:35Z

**Summary**: Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.

### Round Attention: A Novel Round-Level Attention Mechanism to Accelerate   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T13:35:18Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.

### CodeSwift: Accelerating LLM Inference for Efficient Code Generation
**Authors**: Qianhui Zhao, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Xiaoli Lian, Qiaoyuanhe Meng, Ziqian Jiao, Zetong Zhou, Borui Zhang, Runlin Guo, Jia Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T13:30:30Z

**Summary**: Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but the autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to poor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.

### DBudgetKV: Dynamic Budget in KV Cache Compression for Ensuring Optimal   Performance
**Authors**: Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T06:33:39Z

**Summary**: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. However, these techniques often require a pre-defined cache budget; as the optimal budget varies with different input lengths and task types, it limits their practical deployment accepting open-domain instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.

### KVCrush: Key value cache size-reduction using similarity in   head-behaviour
**Authors**: Gopi Krishna Jha, Sameh Gobriel, Liubov Talamanova, Alexander Kozlov, Nilesh Jain

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T02:57:51Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has emerged as a crucial optimization technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs). By allowing the attention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total sequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput. However, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint of the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the model's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing research addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding low-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically lead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.   In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many KV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller memory. KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value states, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the token distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller footprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results, KVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop and achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring less than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is also compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging schemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.

### BaKlaVa -- Budgeted Allocation of KV cache for Long-context Inference
**Authors**: Ahmed Burak Gulhan, Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Murali Emani, Mahmut Kandemir, Venkatram Vishwanath

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T01:28:27Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, Key-Value (KV) caches (KV-caches) are essential for reducing time complexity. However, they result in a linear increase in GPU memory as the context length grows. While recent work explores KV-cache eviction and compression policies to reduce memory usage, they often consider uniform KV-caches across all attention heads, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce BaKlaVa, a method to allocate optimal memory for individual KV-caches across the model by estimating the importance of each KV-cache. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that not all KV-caches are equally critical for LLM performance. Using a one-time profiling approach, BaKlaVa assigns optimal memory budgets to each KV-cache. We evaluated our method on LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B models, achieving up to a 70\% compression ratio while keeping baseline performance and delivering up to an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at higher compression levels.

### Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for   Knowledge Tasks
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T19:48:12Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T16:17:34Z

**Summary**: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) empowered multi-functional 6G wireless networks are investigated. Starting with the communication functionality, various types of STARS are introduced in terms of power amplification capabilities, reciprocity features, and spatial density of elements. Then, three STARS-empowered wireless sensing architectures are proposed, namely STARS-aided monostatic sensing, STARS-enabled bistatic sensing, and sensing with target-mounted STARS, where the representative benefits and application challenges are identified. Furthermore, promising applications of STARS for computing and caching functionalities are explored to improve the computation efficiency and reduce the content delivery latency. Finally, recent standardization progress for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces is presented for motivating the employment of STARS in multi-functional 6G.

### A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear   Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing
**Authors**: Minquan Cheng, Huimei Wei, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T11:52:45Z

**Summary**: Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

### Cache Coherence Over Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Ruihong Wang, Jianguo Wang, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T03:27:01Z

**Summary**: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol , thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

### PLDR-LLMs Learn A Generalizable Tensor Operator That Can Replace Its Own   Deep Neural Net At Inference
**Authors**: Burc Gokden

**Updated**: 2025-02-22T22:32:08Z

**Summary**: We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.

### Warp-centric GPU meta-meshing and fast triangulation of billion-scale   lattice structures
**Authors**: Qiang Zou, Yunzhu Gao

**Updated**: 2025-02-22T10:31:51Z

**Summary**: Lattice structures have been widely used in applications due to their superior mechanical properties. To fabricate such structures, a geometric processing step called triangulation is often employed to transform them into the STL format before sending them to 3D printers. Because lattice structures tend to have high geometric complexity, this step usually generates a large amount of triangles, a memory and compute-intensive task. This problem manifests itself clearly through large-scale lattice structures that have millions or billions of struts. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transform a lattice structure into an intermediate model called meta-mesh before undergoing real triangulation. Compared to triangular meshes, meta-meshes are very lightweight and much less compute-demanding. The meta-mesh can also work as a base mesh reusable for conveniently and efficiently triangulating lattice structures with arbitrary resolutions. A CPU+GPU asynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate meta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU algorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric design paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data compression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced scheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch divergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the proposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously achievable.

### KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao, Shiyu Chang

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T23:34:29Z

**Summary**: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation of LLMs when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces three key components: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents, and applying mixed-data fine-tuning to enhance performance while preserving the model's original capabilities. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 90% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

### Compression Barriers for Autoregressive Transformers
**Authors**: Themistoklis Haris, Krzysztof Onak

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T21:37:52Z

**Summary**: A key limitation of autoregressive Transformers is the large memory needed at inference-time to cache all previous key-value (KV) embeddings. Prior works address this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural properties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can truly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for attention-based token generation must use $\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated so far and $d = \Omega(\log n)$ is the dimension of the KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication complexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties of projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the low-dimensional regime $d = o(\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers, that SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this bound. Further, we investigate how sparsity assumptions enable token generation in truly sublinear space, presenting impossibility results and proposing a new KV cache compression algorithm for sliding window attention when the value cache outside the window is unmasked. Finally, we analyze token generation's time complexity, using an indistinguishability argument to prove that no non-adaptive algorithm can compute attention online in sublinear time for all tokens.

### U-index: A Universal Indexing Framework for Matching Long Patterns
**Authors**: Lorraine A. K. Ayad, Gabriele Fici, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp, Grigorios Loukides, Rob Patro, Giulio Ermanno Pibiri, Solon P. Pissis

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T13:35:43Z

**Summary**: Text indexing is a fundamental and well-studied problem. Classic solutions either replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the FM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy - an index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent compressed space, but areslow in practice. The latter approaches, like the suffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.   We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra space on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are sufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in which a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the text. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the original text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us to use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index, or r-index.   We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With an extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal indexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and take a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower bound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore, these data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query time, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying candidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in practice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text). Finally, we discuss some important applications of this novel indexing paradigm to computational biology. We hypothesize that such indexes will be particularly effective when the queries are sufficiently long, and so demonstrate applications in long-read mapping.

### CoKV: Optimizing KV Cache Allocation via Cooperative Game
**Authors**: Qiheng Sun, Hongwei Zhang, Haocheng Xia, Jiayao Zhang, Jinfei Liu, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T12:03:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on various aspects of human life. However, one of the major challenges in deploying these models is the substantial memory consumption required to store key-value pairs (KV), which imposes significant resource demands. Recent research has focused on KV cache budget allocation, with several approaches proposing head-level budget distribution by evaluating the importance of individual attention heads. These methods, however, assess the importance of heads independently, overlooking their cooperative contributions within the model, which may result in a deviation from their true impact on model performance. In light of this limitation, we propose CoKV, a novel method that models the cooperation between heads in model inference as a cooperative game. By evaluating the contribution of each head within the cooperative game, CoKV can allocate the cache budget more effectively. Extensive experiments show that CoKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LongBench benchmark using LLama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B models.

### SVDq: 1.25-bit and 410x Key Cache Compression for LLM Attention
**Authors**: Hong Yankun, Li Xing, Zhen Hui-Ling, Yu Xianzhi, Liu Wulong, Yuan Mingxuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T08:55:21Z

**Summary**: For the efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), the effective compression of key-value (KV) cache is essential. Three main types of KV cache compression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization, have been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K cache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations. Since the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after only a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware quantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective allocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we prove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are much lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space. Our findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can achieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined with key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for attention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance. Notably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates that SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more efficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.

### SAAP: Spatial awareness and Association based Prefetching of Virtual   Objects in Augmented Reality at the Edge
**Authors**: Nikhil Sreekumar, Abhishek Chandra, Jon Weissman

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T04:07:00Z

**Summary**: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T23:28:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in large-scale online services, enabling sophisticated applications. However, the computational overhead of generating key-value (KV) caches in the prefill stage presents a major bottleneck, particularly for long-context inputs. Prefix caching mitigates this issue by storing KV caches for reuse, reducing redundant computation. Despite its advantages, prefix caching suffers from high latency due to the limited I/O bandwidth of storage devices, constraining inference efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduce Cake, a novel KV cache loading system that optimally utilizes both computational and I/O resources in parallel. Cake employs a bidirectional scheduling strategy that dynamically balances KV cache computation and loading, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Additionally, Cake incorporates an adaptive scheduling mechanism that seamlessly integrates with non-prefix caching requests, improving system throughput and adapting to fluctuating resource availabilty. Through extensive evaluations across various hardware configurations, datasets, and storage conditions, Cake achieves on average 2.6x reduction in Time to First Token (TTFT) compared to compute-only and I/O-only methods. Our findings highlight Cake as an effective and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM inference, bridging the gap between computation and I/O efficiency in large-scale AI deployments.

### More for Keys, Less for Values: Adaptive KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Mohsen Hariri, Lam Nguyen, Sixu Chen, Shaochen Zhong, Qifan Wang, Xia Hu, Xiaotian Han, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T22:24:27Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an information-aware quantization framework that adaptively compresses the key-value (KV) cache in large language models (LLMs). Although prior work has underscored the distinct roles of key and value cache during inference, our systematic analysis -- examining singular value distributions, spectral norms, and Frobenius norms -- reveals, for the first time, that key matrices consistently exhibit higher norm values and are more sensitive to quantization than value matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization errors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more bit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm values. With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates error propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory savings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that our mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even under aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for Value achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit for Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T18:59:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent   Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs
**Authors**: Tao Ji, Bin Guo, Yuanbin Wu, Qipeng Guo, Lixing Shen, Zhan Chen, Xipeng Qiu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T18:50:42Z

**Summary**: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T14:01:17Z

**Summary**: Rendering large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model faces significant challenges in achieving real-time, high-fidelity performance on consumer-grade devices. Fully realizing the potential of 3DGS in applications such as virtual reality (VR) requires addressing critical system-level challenges to support real-time, immersive experiences. We propose GS-Cache, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates 3DGS's advanced representation with a highly optimized rendering system. GS-Cache introduces a cache-centric pipeline to eliminate redundant computations, an efficiency-aware scheduler for elastic multi-GPU rendering, and optimized CUDA kernels to overcome computational bottlenecks. This synergy between 3DGS and system design enables GS-Cache to achieve up to 5.35x performance improvement, 35% latency reduction, and 42% lower GPU memory usage, supporting 2K binocular rendering at over 120 FPS with high visual quality. By bridging the gap between 3DGS's representation power and the demands of VR systems, GS-Cache establishes a scalable and efficient framework for real-time neural rendering in immersive environments.

### PLPHP: Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning for Efficient Large   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yu Meng, Kaiyuan Li, Chenran Huang, Chen Gao, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li, Xiaoping Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T12:31:31Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of multimodal tasks. However, their inference efficiency is constrained by the large number of visual tokens processed during decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning (PLPHP), a two-level fine-grained pruning method including Layer-Level Retention Rate Allocation and Head-Level Vision Token Pruning. Motivated by the Vision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically adjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger attention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with lower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies pruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same layer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and reduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of 0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance improvements in multi-image tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of fine-grained token pruning and contribute to advancing the efficiency and scalability of LVLMs. Our source code will be made publicly available.

### More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision   Trade-off in KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T12:14:49Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension separately. However, these works leaving the trade-off between these two orthogonal dimensions largely under-explored. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression.Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision,a strategy we term quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. In-depth analysis of the token-precision trade-off across key aspects demonstrates that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Furthermore, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability and effectiveness across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing KV cache compression through balanced token-precision trade-off strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhzihao/QPruningKV.

### Neural Attention Search
**Authors**: Difan Deng, Marius Lindauer

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T09:03:05Z

**Summary**: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.

**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Chenyang Zhao, Chiwun Yang, Fanghua Ye, Hongxia Yang, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T07:10:43Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts is crucial for large language models (LLMs). While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization, effective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly fine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the attention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context extrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while maintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into attention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical solutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we propose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more stable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction strategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU. To further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction technique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to attention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's performance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length context, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat.

### Î¼RL: Discovering Transient Execution Vulnerabilities Using   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: M. Caner Tol, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T06:42:03Z

**Summary**: We propose using reinforcement learning to address the challenges of discovering microarchitectural vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown, which exploit subtle interactions in modern processors. Traditional methods like random fuzzing fail to efficiently explore the vast instruction space and often miss vulnerabilities that manifest under specific conditions. To overcome this, we introduce an intelligent, feedback-driven approach using RL. Our RL agents interact with the processor, learning from real-time feedback to prioritize instruction sequences more likely to reveal vulnerabilities, significantly improving the efficiency of the discovery process.   We also demonstrate that RL systems adapt effectively to various microarchitectures, providing a scalable solution across processor generations. By automating the exploration process, we reduce the need for human intervention, enabling continuous learning that uncovers hidden vulnerabilities. Additionally, our approach detects subtle signals, such as timing anomalies or unusual cache behavior, that may indicate microarchitectural weaknesses. This proposal advances hardware security testing by introducing a more efficient, adaptive, and systematic framework for protecting modern processors.   When unleashed on Intel Skylake-X and Raptor Lake microarchitectures, our RL agent was indeed able to generate instruction sequences that cause significant observable byte leakages through transient execution without generating any $\mu$code assists, faults or interrupts. The newly identified leaky sequences stem from a variety of Intel instructions, e.g. including SERIALIZE, VERR/VERW, CLMUL, MMX-x87 transitions, LSL+RDSCP and LAR. These initial results give credence to the proposed approach.

**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T06:07:00Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpinQuant.

**Authors**: Subhajit Chaudhury, Payel Das, Sarathkrishna Swaminathan, Georgios Kollias, Elliot Nelson, Khushbu Pahwa, Tejaswini Pedapati, Igor Melnyk, Matthew Riemer

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T05:41:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded impressive successes on many language tasks. However, efficient processing of long contexts using LLMs remains a significant challenge. We introduce \textbf{EpMAN} -- a method for processing long contexts in an \textit{episodic memory} module while \textit{holistically attending to} semantically relevant context chunks. The output of \textit{episodic attention} is then used to reweigh the decoder's self-attention to the stored KV cache of the context during training and generation. When an LLM decoder is trained using \textbf{EpMAN}, its performance on multiple challenging single-hop long-context recall and question-answering benchmarks is found to be stronger and more robust across the range from 16k to 256k tokens than baseline decoders trained with self-attention, and popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.

 ### Bias Unveiled: Investigating Social Bias in LLM-Generated Code
**Authors**: Lin Ling, Fazle Rabbi, Song Wang, Jinqiu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:59:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in evaluating social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several prompting strategies for mitigating bias, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and dialogue with Solar. Our experiments show that dialogue with Solar can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Last, we make the code and data publicly available is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.

### Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput   tradeoff
**Authors**: Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher RÃ©

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:57:52Z

**Summary**: Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. Code for this work is provided at: https://github.com/HazyResearch/based.

### Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic   Microwave Background
**Authors**: Itamar J. Allali, Praniti Singh, JiJi Fan, Lingfeng Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:57:13Z

**Summary**: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of $\tau_{\rm reio}$, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. $\ell <30$) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.

### Entangled Relations: Leveraging NLI and Meta-analysis to Enhance   Biomedical Relation Extraction
**Authors**: William Hogan, Jingbo Shang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:48:54Z

**Summary**: Recent research efforts have explored the potential of leveraging natural language inference (NLI) techniques to enhance relation extraction (RE). In this vein, we introduce MetaEntailRE, a novel adaptation method that harnesses NLI principles to enhance RE performance. Our approach follows past works by verbalizing relation classes into class-indicative hypotheses, aligning a traditionally multi-class classification task to one of textual entailment. We introduce three key enhancements: (1) Meta-class analysis which, instead of labeling non-entailed premise-hypothesis pairs with the less informative "neutral" entailment label, provides additional context by analyzing overarching meta-relationships between classes; (2) Feasible hypothesis filtering, which removes unlikely hypotheses from consideration based on domain knowledge derived from data; and (3) Group-based prediction selection, which further improves performance by selecting highly confident predictions. MetaEntailRE is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, yielding significant improvements over conventional relation extraction techniques and other NLI formulations. We observe surprisingly large F1 gains of 17.6 points on BioRED and 13.4 points on ReTACRED compared to conventional methods, underscoring the versatility of MetaEntailRE across both biomedical and general domains.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:45:42Z

**Summary**: Keeping large language models factually up-to-date is crucial for deployment, yet costly retraining remains a challenge. Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.

### DeltaProduct: Increasing the Expressivity of DeltaNet Through Products   of Householders
**Authors**: Julien Siems, Timur Carstensen, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil, Riccardo Grazzi

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:31:55Z

**Summary**: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.

### AIM-Fair: Advancing Algorithmic Fairness via Selectively Fine-Tuning   Biased Models with Contextual Synthetic Data
**Authors**: Zengqun Zhao, Ziquan Liu, Yu Cao, Shaogang Gong, Ioannis Patras

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:26:48Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.

### A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and   Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Shutong Qiao, Jiaqi Zhang, Tzu-Heng Lin, Chen Gao, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:20:30Z

**Summary**: Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over the past two decades, search and recommendation systems (collectively referred to as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language model agents in enhancing search and recommendation systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing current challenges in search and recommendation, providing insights into future research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers on agent-based simulation with large language models at this link: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-for-Recommendation-and-Search.

### START: Self-taught Reasoner with Tools
**Authors**: Chengpeng Li, Mingfeng Xue, Zhenru Zhang, Jiaxi Yang, Beichen Zhang, Xiang Wang, Bowen Yu, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin, Dayiheng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:13:22Z

**Summary**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through the utilization of long Chain-of-thought (CoT). However, these models often suffer from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA (GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary model o1-Preview.

### Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for   Heterogeneous Reasoning
**Authors**: Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Sukwon Yun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:03:13Z

**Summary**: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

### Integration of aggregated data in causally interpretable meta-analysis   by inverse weighting
**Authors**: Tat-Thang Vo, Tran Trong Khoi Le, Sivem Afach, Stijn Vansteelandt

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:56:44Z

**Summary**: Obtaining causally interpretable meta-analysis results is challenging when there are differences in the distribution of effect modifiers between eligible trials. To overcome this, recent work on transportability methods has considered standardizing results of individual studies over the case-mix of a target population, prior to pooling them as in a classical random-effect meta-analysis. One practical challenge, however, is that case-mix standardization often requires individual participant data (IPD) on outcome, treatments and case-mix characteristics to be fully accessible in every eligible study, along with IPD case-mix characteristics for a random sample from the target population. In this paper, we aim to develop novel strategies to integrate aggregated-level data from eligible trials with non-accessible IPD into a causal meta-analysis, by extending moment-based methods frequently used for population-adjusted indirect comparison in health technology assessment. Since valid inference for these moment-based methods by M-estimation theory requires additional aggregated data that are often unavailable in practice, computational methods to address this concern are also developed. We assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed approaches by simulated data, and then apply these on real-world clinical data to investigate the effectiveness of risankizumab versus ustekinumab among patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

### LLMorpheus: Mutation Testing using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Frank Tip, Jonathan Bell, Max Schaefer

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:48:47Z

**Summary**: In mutation testing, the quality of a test suite is evaluated by introducing faults into a program and determining whether the program's tests detect them. Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a "+" with a "-", or removing a function's body. However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a technique for mutation testing where placeholders are introduced at designated locations in a program's source code and where a Large Language Model (LLM) is prompted to ask what they could be replaced with. The technique is implemented in LLMorpheus, a mutation testing tool for JavaScript, and evaluated on 13 subject packages, considering several variations on the prompting strategy, and using several LLMs. We find LLMorpheus to be capable of producing mutants that resemble existing bugs that cannot be produced by StrykerJS, a state-of-the-art mutation testing tool. Moreover, we report on the running time, cost, and number of mutants produced by LLMorpheus, demonstrating its practicality.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:47:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DeFT.

### Learning LLM Preference over Intra-Dialogue Pairs: A Framework for   Utterance-level Understandings
**Authors**: Xuanqing Liu, Luyang Kong, Wei Niu, Afshin Khashei, Belinda Zeng, Steve Johnson, Jon Jay, Davor Golac, Matt Pope

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:46:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex dialogue tasks without requiring use case-specific fine-tuning. However, analyzing live dialogues in real-time necessitates low-latency processing systems, making it impractical to deploy models with billions of parameters due to latency constraints. As a result, practitioners often prefer smaller models with millions of parameters, trained on high-quality, human-annotated datasets. Yet, curating such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to combine the scalability of LLM-generated labels with the precision of human annotations, enabling fine-tuned smaller models to achieve both higher speed and accuracy comparable to larger models. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework to address this challenge. Our approach is specifically designed for per-utterance classification problems, which encompass tasks such as intent detection, dialogue state tracking, and more. To mitigate the impact of labeling errors from LLMs -- the primary source of inaccuracies in student models -- we propose a noise-reduced preference learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy across utterance-level dialogue tasks, including sentiment detection (over $2\%$), dialogue act classification (over $1.5\%$), etc.

### Conformal Prediction for Image Segmentation Using Morphological   Prediction Sets
**Authors**: Luca Mossina, Corentin Friedrich

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:42:30Z

**Summary**: Image segmentation is a challenging task influenced by multiple sources of uncertainty, such as the data labeling process or the sampling of training data. In this paper we focus on binary segmentation and address these challenges using conformal prediction, a family of model- and data-agnostic methods for uncertainty quantification that provide finite-sample theoretical guarantees and applicable to any pretrained predictor. Our approach involves computing nonconformity scores, a type of prediction residual, on held-out calibration data not used during training. We use dilation, one of the fundamental operations in mathematical morphology, to construct a margin added to the borders of predicted segmentation masks. At inference, the predicted set formed by the mask and its margin contains the ground-truth mask with high probability, at a confidence level specified by the user. The size of the margin serves as an indicator of predictive uncertainty for a given model and dataset. We work in a regime of minimal information as we do not require any feedback from the predictor: only the predicted masks are needed for computing the prediction sets. Hence, our method is applicable to any segmentation model, including those based on deep learning; we evaluate our approach on several medical imaging applications.

### A Survey on Sparse Autoencoders: Interpreting the Internal Mechanisms of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:38:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of SAEs as a promising approach to interpreting and understanding LLMs. We provide a systematic overview of SAE principles, architectures, and applications specifically tailored for LLM analysis, covering theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and recent developments in sparsity mechanisms. We also explore how SAEs can be leveraged to explain the internal workings of LLMs, steer model behaviors in desired directions, and develop more transparent training methodologies for future models. Despite the challenges that remain around SAE implementation and scaling, they continue to provide valuable tools for understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models.

### The shape of FIREbox galaxies and a potential tension with low-mass   disks
**Authors**: Courtney Klein, James S. Bullock, Luke Xia, Jorge Moreno, Robert Feldmann, Francisco J. Mercado, Claude-AndrÃ© Faucher-GiguÃ¨re, Jonathan Stern, N. Nicole Sanchez, Abdelaziz Hussein

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:36:31Z

**Summary**: We study the intrinsic and observable shapes of approximately 700 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $10^8 - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ from the FIREbox simulation at $z=0$. We calculate intrinsic axis ratios using inertia tensors weighted by: All Stars, Young Stars, and Luminosity-weighted Stars. Young Stars, in particular, are arranged in systematically different 3D configurations as a function of galaxy stellar mass, with spheroidal, elongated, and disky shapes dominant at stellar masses of $10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$, $10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$, and $10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We construct mock images for each galaxy and show that projected short-to-long axis ratios, $q$, inferred from 2D S\'ersic fits are most closely related to Luminosity-weighted tensor shapes and least resemble the All Stars shapes. This suggests observed 2D shape distributions should not be compared to predictions based on 3D stellar mass shapes. We construct a sample of mock images projected in random orientations and compare them to observed axis ratio distributions from the GAMA survey. For galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10} - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, we reproduce axis ratios comparable to the thinnest observed in real galaxies ($q \sim 0.1$), suggesting this model is capable of making thin disk galaxies at Milky Way scale. However, at masses below $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we produce an insufficient population of galaxies with observed $q<0.4$ and none with $q<0.2$, suggesting that FIREbox does not produce enough low-mass disk galaxies. Future observational and theoretical programs aimed at understanding low-mass disk fractions will provide crucial tests of galaxy formation models.

### Language Models Enable Simple Systems for Generating Structured Views of   Heterogeneous Data Lakes
**Authors**: Simran Arora, Brandon Yang, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avanika Narayan, Andrew Hojel, Immanuel Trummer, Christopher RÃ©

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:33:50Z

**Summary**: A long standing goal of the data management community is to develop general, automated systems that ingest semi-structured documents and output queryable tables without human effort or domain specific customization. Given the sheer variety of potential documents, state-of-the art systems make simplifying assumptions and use domain specific training. In this work, we ask whether we can maintain generality by using large language models (LLMs). LLMs, which are pretrained on broad data, can perform diverse downstream tasks simply conditioned on natural language task descriptions.   We propose and evaluate EVAPORATE, a simple, prototype system powered by LLMs. We identify two fundamentally different strategies for implementing this system: prompt the LLM to directly extract values from documents or prompt the LLM to synthesize code that performs the extraction. Our evaluations show a cost-quality tradeoff between these two approaches. Code synthesis is cheap, but far less accurate than directly processing each document with the LLM. To improve quality while maintaining low cost, we propose an extended code synthesis implementation, EVAPORATE-CODE+, which achieves better quality than direct extraction. Our key insight is to generate many candidate functions and ensemble their extractions using weak supervision. EVAPORATE-CODE+ not only outperforms the state-of-the art systems, but does so using a sublinear pass over the documents with the LLM. This equates to a 110x reduction in the number of tokens the LLM needs to process, averaged across 16 real-world evaluation settings of 10k documents each.

### Improved Generalizability of CNN Based Lane Detection in Challenging   Weather Using Adaptive Preprocessing Parameter Tuning
**Authors**: I-Chen Sang, William R. Norris

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:33:42Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the robustness of lane detection systems is essential for the reliability of autonomous vehicles, particularly in the face of diverse weather conditions. While numerous algorithms have been proposed, addressing challenges posed by varying weather remains an ongoing issue. Geometric-based lane detection methods, rooted in the inherent properties of road geometry, provide enhanced generalizability. However, these methods often require manual parameter tuning to accommodate it fluctuating illumination and weather conditions. Conversely, learning-based approaches, trained on pre-labeled datasets, excel in localizing intricate and curved lane configurations but grapple with the absence of diverse weather datasets. This paper introduces a promising hybrid approach that merges the strengths of both methodologies. A novel adaptive preprocessing method is proposed in this work. Utilizing a fuzzy inference system (FIS), the algorithm dynamically adjusts parameters in geometric-based image processing functions and enhances adaptability to diverse weather conditions. Notably, this preprocessing algorithm is designed to seamlessly integrate with all learning-based lane detection models. When implemented in conjunction with CNN-based models, the hybrid approach demonstrates commendable generalizability across weather conditions and adaptability to complex lane configurations. Rigorous testing on datasets featuring challenging weather conditions showcases the proposed method's significant improvements over existing models, underscoring its efficacy in addressing the persistent challenges associated with lane detection in adverse weather scenarios.

**Authors**: Prashant K. Jha

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:25:25Z

**Summary**: This focused review explores a range of neural operator architectures for approximating solutions to parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), emphasizing high-level concepts and practical implementation strategies. The study covers foundational models such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), Principal Component Analysis-based Neural Networks (PCANet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), providing comparative insights into their core methodologies and performance. These architectures are demonstrated on two classical linear parametric PDEs: the Poisson equation and linear elastic deformation. Beyond forward problem-solving, the review delves into applying neural operators as surrogates in Bayesian inference problems, showcasing their effectiveness in accelerating posterior inference while maintaining accuracy. The paper concludes by discussing current challenges, particularly in controlling prediction accuracy and generalization. It outlines emerging strategies to address these issues, such as residual-based error correction and multi-level training. This review can be seen as a comprehensive guide to implementing neural operators and integrating them into scientific computing workflows.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:24:35Z

**Summary**: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

### Exact Simulation of Longitudinal Data from Marginal Structural Models
**Authors**: Xi Lin, Daniel de Vassimon Manela, Chase Mathis, Jens Magelund Tarp, Robin J. Evans

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:15:30Z

**Summary**: Simulating longitudinal data from specified marginal structural models is a crucial but challenging task for evaluating causal inference methods and clinical trial design. While data generation typically proceeds in a fully conditional manner using structural equations according to a temporal ordering, it is difficult to ensure alignment between conditional distributions and the target marginal causal effects. This misalignment presents a fundamental challenge in simulating data that adheres to marginal structural model specifications. To address this, we propose a flexible and efficient algorithm for simulating longitudinal data that adheres exactly to a specified marginal structural model. Recognizing the importance of time-to-event outcomes in clinical research, we extend our approach to accommodate survival models. Compared to existing approaches, our method offers several advantages: it enables exact simulation from a known causal model rather than relying on approximations; avoids restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process; and remains computationally efficient by requiring only the evaluation of analytic functions. This last benefit contrasts with methods that use computationally intensive techniques such as Monte Carlo approximations or numerical integration. Through simulation studies replicating realistic scenarios, we validate the method's accuracy and utility. Our method will facilitate researchers in effectively simulating data with target causal structures for their specific scenarios.

### R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Huatong Song, Jinhao Jiang, Yingqian Min, Jie Chen, Zhipeng Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Lei Fang, Ji-Rong Wen

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:14:44Z

**Summary**: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.

### Quantifying the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models   Against Spurious Features in Grounding Data
**Authors**: Shiping Yang, Jie Wu, Wenbiao Ding, Ning Wu, Shining Liang, Ming Gong, Hengyuan Zhang, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:11:34Z

**Summary**: Robustness has become a critical attribute for the deployment of RAG systems in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on robustness to explicit noise (e.g., document semantics) but overlooks spurious features (a.k.a. implicit noise). While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs, they are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios (e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious features in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through controlled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features are harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes. Extensive evaluation results across multiple LLMs suggest that spurious features are a widespread and challenging problem in the field of RAG. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research. We release all codes and data at: $\\\href{https://github.com/maybenotime/RAG-SpuriousFeatures}{https://github.com/maybenotime/RAG-SpuriousFeatures}$.

### TRADE: Transfer of Distributions between External Conditions with   Normalizing Flows
**Authors**: Stefan Wahl, Armand Rousselot, Felix Draxler, Henrik Schopmans, Ullrich KÃ¶the

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:08:45Z

**Summary**: Modeling distributions that depend on external control parameters is a common scenario in diverse applications like molecular simulations, where system properties like temperature affect molecular configurations. Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on energy-based training, which is prone to instability. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d.~samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.

### Just Ramp-up: Unleash the Potential of Regression-based Estimator for   A/B Tests under Network Interference
**Authors**: Qianyi Chen, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:08:25Z

**Summary**: Recent research in causal inference under network interference has explored various experimental designs and estimation techniques to address this issue. However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.

### AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models
**Authors**: Junfeng Fang, Houcheng Jiang, Kun Wang, Yunshan Ma, Shi Jie, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Tat-seng Chua

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:06:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.4% with a single line of additional code for projection solely. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AlphaEdit.

### Data-Driven Invariant Learning for Probabilistic Programs
**Authors**: Jialu Bao, Nitesh Trivedi, Drashti Pathak, Justin Hsu, Subhajit Roy

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:58:50Z

**Summary**: Morgan and McIver's weakest pre-expectation framework is one of the most well-established methods for deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Roughly, the idea is to generalize binary state assertions to real-valued expectations, which can measure expected values of probabilistic program quantities. While loop-free programs can be analyzed by mechanically transforming expectations, verifying loops usually requires finding an invariant expectation, a difficult task. We propose a new view of invariant expectation synthesis as a regression problem: given an input state, predict the average value of the post-expectation in the output distribution. Guided by this perspective, we develop the first data-driven invariant synthesis method for probabilistic programs. Unlike prior work on probabilistic invariant inference, our approach can learn piecewise continuous invariants without relying on template expectations, and also works with black-box access to the program. We also develop a data-driven approach to learn sub-invariants from data, which can be used to upper- or lower-bound expected values. We implement our approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of benchmarks from the probabilistic programming literature.

### Search for primordial black holes from gravitational wave populations   using deep learning
**Authors**: Hai-Long Huang, Jun-Qian Jiang, Jibin He, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:53:10Z

**Summary**: Gravitational waves (GWs) signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration might be sourced (partly) by the merges of primordial black holes (PBHs). The conventional hierarchical Bayesian inference methods can allow us to study population properties of GW events to search for the hints for PBHs. However, hierarchical Bayesian analysis require an analytic population model, and becomes increasingly computationally expensive as the number of sources grows. In this paper, we present a novel population analysis method based on deep learning, which enables the direct and efficient estimation of PBH population hyperparameters, such as the PBH fraction in dark matter, $f_{\rm PBH}$. Our approach leverages neural posterior estimation combined with conditional normalizing flows and two embedding networks. Our results demonstrate that inference can be performed within seconds, highlighting the promise of deep learning as a powerful tool for population inference with an increasing number of GW signals for next-generation detectors.

### Evaluating open-source Large Language Models for automated fact-checking
**Authors**: Nicolo' Fontana, Francesco Corso, Enrico Zuccolotto, Francesco Pierri

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:45:33Z

**Summary**: The increasing prevalence of online misinformation has heightened the demand for automated fact-checking solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for assisting in this task, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This study evaluates the fact-checking capabilities of various open-source LLMs, focusing on their ability to assess claims with different levels of contextual information. We conduct three key experiments: (1) evaluating whether LLMs can identify the semantic relationship between a claim and a fact-checking article, (2) assessing models' accuracy in verifying claims when given a related fact-checking article, and (3) testing LLMs' fact-checking abilities when leveraging data from external knowledge sources such as Google and Wikipedia. Our results indicate that LLMs perform well in identifying claim-article connections and verifying fact-checked stories but struggle with confirming factual news, where they are outperformed by traditional fine-tuned models such as RoBERTa. Additionally, the introduction of external knowledge does not significantly enhance LLMs' performance, calling for more tailored approaches. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automated fact-checking, emphasizing the need for further refinements before they can reliably replace human fact-checkers.

### SoK: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs are Rushing Nowhere (and How   to Fix It)
**Authors**: Matthieu Meeus, Igor Shilov, Shubham Jain, Manuel Faysse, Marek Rei, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:30:07Z

**Summary**: Whether LLMs memorize their training data and what this means, from measuring privacy leakage to detecting copyright violations, has become a rapidly growing area of research. In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.

### Revitalizing Saturated Benchmarks: A Weighted Metric Approach for   Differentiating Large Language Model Performance
**Authors**: Bryan Etzine, Masoud Hashemi, Nishanth Madhusudhan, Sagar Davasam, Roshnee Sharma, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Vikas Yadav

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:25:09Z

**Summary**: Existing benchmarks are becoming saturated and struggle to separate model performances due to factors like data contamination and advancing LLM capabilities. This paper introduces EMDM (Enhanced Model Differentiation Metric), a novel weighted metric that revitalizes benchmarks by enhancing model separation. EMDM integrates final answer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning correctness, assigning weights based on the complexity and reasoning depth required to solve a given sample in the evaluation data. Using a baseline LLM in two setups-Unguided, where the model has no prior exposure to test samples, and Guided, where the model has prior knowledge of the desired answer-EMDM distinguishes instances of varying difficulty. The CoT and answer correctness from these setups inform an optimization objective for weight assignment, resulting in a more nuanced evaluation of model performance. Compared to the exact match (EM) metric, which achieves 17% separation on ARC-Challenge, EMDM achieves 46%, demonstrating its effectiveness in differentiating models based on reasoning and knowledge requirements.

### Pi-GPS: Enhancing Geometry Problem Solving by Unleashing the Power of   Diagrammatic Information
**Authors**: Junbo Zhao, Ting Zhang, Jiayu Sun, Mi Tian, Hua Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:15:00Z

**Summary**: Geometry problem solving has garnered increasing attention due to its potential applications in intelligent education field. Inspired by the observation that text often introduces ambiguities that diagrams can clarify, this paper presents Pi-GPS, a novel framework that unleashes the power of diagrammatic information to resolve textual ambiguities, an aspect largely overlooked in prior research. Specifically, we design a micro module comprising a rectifier and verifier: the rectifier employs MLLMs to disambiguate text based on the diagrammatic context, while the verifier ensures the rectified output adherence to geometric rules, mitigating model hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the impact of LLMs in theorem predictor based on the disambiguated formal language. Empirical results demonstrate that Pi-GPS surpasses state-of-the-art models, achieving a nearly 10\% improvement on Geometry3K over prior neural-symbolic approaches. We hope this work highlights the significance of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical reasoning, a crucial factor limiting performance.

### AutoLUT: LUT-Based Image Super-Resolution with Automatic Sampling and   Adaptive Residual Learning
**Authors**: Yuheng Xu, Shijie Yang, Xin Liu, Jie Liu, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:08:17Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the increasing popularity of Hi-DPI screens has driven a rising demand for high-resolution images. However, the limited computational power of edge devices poses a challenge in deploying complex super-resolution neural networks, highlighting the need for efficient methods. While prior works have made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level information. Moreover, their reliance on fixed sampling patterns limits both accuracy and the ability to capture fine details in low-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce two plug-and-play modules designed to capture and leverage pixel information effectively in Look-Up Table (LUT) based super-resolution networks. Our method introduces Automatic Sampling (AutoSample), a flexible LUT sampling approach where sampling weights are automatically learned during training to adapt to pixel variations and expand the receptive field without added inference cost. We also incorporate Adaptive Residual Learning (AdaRL) to enhance inter-layer connections, enabling detailed information flow and improving the network's ability to reconstruct fine details. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on both MuLUT and SPF-LUT while maintaining similar storage sizes. Specifically, for MuLUT, we achieve a PSNR improvement of approximately +0.20 dB improvement on average across five datasets. For SPF-LUT, with more than a 50% reduction in storage space and about a 2/3 reduction in inference time, our method still maintains performance comparable to the original. The code is available at https://github.com/SuperKenVery/AutoLUT.

**Authors**: Yingzi Ma, Jiongxiao Wang, Fei Wang, Siyuan Ma, Jiazhao Li, Jinsheng Pan, Xiujun Li, Furong Huang, Lichao Sun, Bo Li, Yejin Choi, Muhao Chen, Chaowei Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:05:19Z

**Summary**: Machine unlearning has emerged as an effective strategy for forgetting specific information in the training data. However, with the increasing integration of visual data, privacy concerns in Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce Facial Identity Unlearning Benchmark (FIUBench), a novel VLM unlearning benchmark designed to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms under the Right to be Forgotten setting. Specifically, we formulate the VLM unlearning task via constructing the Fictitious Facial Identity VQA dataset and apply a two-stage evaluation pipeline that is designed to precisely control the sources of information and their exposure levels. In terms of evaluation, since VLM supports various forms of ways to ask questions with the same semantic meaning, we also provide robust evaluation metrics including membership inference attacks and carefully designed adversarial privacy attacks to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Through the evaluation of four baseline VLM unlearning algorithms within FIUBench, we find that all methods remain limited in their unlearning performance, with significant trade-offs between model utility and forget quality. Furthermore, our findings also highlight the importance of privacy attacks for robust evaluations. We hope FIUBench will drive progress in developing more effective VLM unlearning algorithms.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:54:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. We evaluate Proximity on the MMLU and MedRAG benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining response accuracy. Proximity reduces retrieval latency by up to 59% while maintaining accuracy and lowers the computational burden on the vector database. We also experiment with different similarity thresholds and quantify the trade-off between speed and recall. Our work shows that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### PoSSUM: A Protocol for Surveying Social-media Users with Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Roberto Cerina

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:49:56Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces PoSSUM, an open-source protocol for unobtrusive polling of social-media users via multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). PoSSUM leverages users' real-time posts, images, and other digital traces to create silicon samples that capture information not present in the LLM's training data. To obtain representative estimates, PoSSUM employs Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MrP) with structured priors to counteract the observable selection biases of social-media platforms. The protocol is validated during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, for which five PoSSUM polls were conducted and published on GitHub and X. In the final poll, fielded October 17-26 with a synthetic sample of 1,054 X users, PoSSUM accurately predicted the outcomes in 50 of 51 states and assigned the Republican candidate a win probability of 0.65. Notably, it also exhibited lower state-level bias than most established pollsters. These results demonstrate PoSSUM's potential as a fully automated, unobtrusive alternative to traditional survey methods.

### Bayesian framework to infer the Hubble constant from the   cross-correlation of individual gravitational wave events with galaxies
**Authors**: Tathagata Ghosh, Surhud More, Sayantani Bera, Sukanta Bose

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:48:05Z

**Summary**: Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of binary compact objects offer a one-step measurement of the luminosity distance to the event, which is essential for the measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, which characterizes the expansion rate of the Universe. However, unlike binary neutron stars, the inspiral of binary black holes is not expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic radiation and a subsequent determination of its redshift. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we present a novel Bayesian approach to infer $H_0$ by measuring the overdensity of galaxies around individual binary black hole merger events in configuration space. We model the measured overdensity using the $3$D cross-correlation between galaxies and GW events, explicitly accounting for the GW event localization uncertainty. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $250$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 8 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.

### Cognitive Bias Detection Using Advanced Prompt Engineering
**Authors**: Frederic Lemieux, Aisha Behr, Clara Kellermann-Bryant, Zaki Mohammed

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:35:37Z

**Summary**: Cognitive biases, systematic deviations from rationality in judgment, pose significant challenges in generating objective content. This paper introduces a novel approach for real-time cognitive bias detection in user-generated text using large language models (LLMs) and advanced prompt engineering techniques. The proposed system analyzes textual data to identify common cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, circular reasoning, and hidden assumption. By designing tailored prompts, the system effectively leverages LLMs' capabilities to both recognize and mitigate these biases, improving the quality of human-generated content (e.g., news, media, reports). Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach in identifying cognitive biases, offering a valuable tool for enhancing content objectivity and reducing the risks of biased decision-making.

### Bootstrapping Language Models with DPO Implicit Rewards
**Authors**: Changyu Chen, Zichen Liu, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:26:03Z

**Summary**: Human alignment in large language models (LLMs) is an active area of research. A recent groundbreaking work, direct preference optimization (DPO), has greatly simplified the process from past work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by bypassing the reward learning stage in RLHF. DPO, after training, provides an implicit reward model. In this work, we make a novel observation that this implicit reward model can by itself be used in a bootstrapping fashion to further align the LLM. Our approach is to use the rewards from a current LLM to construct a preference dataset, which is then used in subsequent DPO rounds. We incorporate two refinements to further improve our approach: 1) length-regularized reward shaping to make the preference dataset length-unbiased; 2) experience replay to enhance the quality of the preference dataset. Our approach, named self-alignment with DPO ImpliCit rEwards (DICE), shows great improvements in alignment. It achieves an increase of more than 8$\\%$ in lengthcontrolled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 for all the different base models that we tried, without relying on external feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/dice.

### Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?
**Authors**: Qingyuan Liang, Zhao Zhang, Zeyu Sun, Zheng Lin, Qi Luo, Yueyi Xiao, Yizhou Chen, Yuqun Zhang, Haotian Zhang, Lu Zhang, Bin Chen, Yingfei Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:23:13Z

**Summary**: Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.

### Statistical Guarantees of Correctness Coverage for Medical   Multiple-Choice Question Answering
**Authors**: Yusong Ke

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:22:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world question-answering (QA) applications. However, LLMs have been proven to generate hallucinations and nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical tasks. Conformal prediction (CP) is well-known to be model-agnostic and distribution-free, which creates statistically rigorous prediction sets in classification tasks. In this work, we for the first time adapt the CP framework to medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks, by correlating the nonconformity score with the frequency score of correct options grounded in self-consistency theory, assuming no access to internal model information. Considering that the adapted CP framework can only control the (mis)coverage rate, we employ a risk control framework, which can manage task-specific metrics by devising a monotonically decreasing loss function. We evaluate our framework on 3 popular medical MCQA datasets utilizing 4 ``off-the-shelf'' LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that we achieve user-specified average (or marginal) error rates on the test set. Furthermore, we observe that the average prediction set size (APSS) on the test set decreases as the risk level increases, which concludes a promising evaluation metric for the uncertainty of LLMs.

### NLI under the Microscope: What Atomic Hypothesis Decomposition Reveals
**Authors**: Neha Srikanth, Rachel Rudinger

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:17:43Z

**Summary**: Decomposition of text into atomic propositions is a flexible framework allowing for the closer inspection of input and output text. We use atomic decomposition of hypotheses in two natural language reasoning tasks, traditional NLI and defeasible NLI, to form atomic sub-problems, or granular inferences that models must weigh when solving the overall problem. These atomic sub-problems serve as a tool to further understand the structure of both NLI and defeasible reasoning, probe a model's consistency and understanding of different inferences, and measure the diversity of examples in benchmark datasets. Our results indicate that LLMs still struggle with logical consistency on atomic NLI and defeasible NLI sub-problems. Lastly, we identify critical atomic sub-problems of defeasible NLI examples, or those that most contribute to the overall label, and propose a method to measure the inferential consistency of a model, a metric designed to capture the degree to which a model makes consistently correct or incorrect predictions about the same fact under different contexts.

### Enhancing Architecture Frameworks by Including Modern Stakeholders and   their Views/Viewpoints
**Authors**: Armin Moin, Atta Badii, Stephan GÃ¼nnemann, Moharram Challenger

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:13:45Z

**Summary**: Various architecture frameworks for software, systems, and enterprises have been proposed in the literature. They identified several stakeholders and defined modeling perspectives, architecture viewpoints, and views to frame and address stakeholder concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML) related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be included in existing architecture frameworks. Only this way can we envision a holistic system architecture description of an ML-enabled system. Note that the ML component behavior and functionalities are special and should be distinguished from traditional software system behavior and functionalities. The main reason is that the actual functionality should be inferred from data instead of being specified at design time. Additionally, the structural models of ML components, such as ML model architectures, are typically specified using different notations and formalisms from what the Software Engineering (SE) community uses for software structural models. Yet, these two aspects, namely ML and non-ML, are becoming so intertwined that it necessitates an extension of software architecture frameworks and modeling practices toward supporting ML-enabled system architectures. In this paper, we address this gap through an empirical study using an online survey instrument. We surveyed 61 subject matter experts from over 25 organizations in 10 countries.

### Adding Alignment Control to Language Models
**Authors**: Wenhong Zhu, Weinan Zhang, Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:13:32Z

**Summary**: Post-training alignment has increasingly become a crucial factor in enhancing the usability of language models (LMs). However, the strength of alignment varies depending on individual preferences. This paper proposes a method to incorporate alignment control into a single model, referred to as CLM. This approach adds one identity layer preceding the initial layers and performs preference learning only on this layer to map unaligned input token embeddings into the aligned space. Experimental results demonstrate that this efficient fine-tuning method performs comparable to full fine-tuning. During inference, the input embeddings are processed through the aligned and unaligned layers, which are then merged through the interpolation coefficient. By controlling this parameter, the alignment exhibits a clear interpolation and extrapolation phenomenon.

### Universality of Layer-Level Entropy-Weighted Quantization Beyond Model   Architecture and Size
**Authors**: Alireza Behtash, Marijan Fofonjka, Ethan Baird, Tyler Mauer, Hossein Moghimifam, David Stout, Joel Dennison

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:12:57Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends the limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.

### I/O in Machine Learning Applications on HPC Systems: A 360-degree Survey
**Authors**: Noah Lewis, Jean Luca Bez, Surendra Byna

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:11:30Z

**Summary**: Growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in a surge in demand for faster methods of Machine Learning (ML) model training and inference. This demand for speed has prompted the use of high performance computing (HPC) systems that excel in managing distributed workloads. Because data is the main fuel for AI applications, the performance of the storage and I/O subsystem of HPC systems is critical. In the past, HPC applications accessed large portions of data written by simulations or experiments or ingested data for visualizations or analysis tasks. ML workloads perform small reads spread across a large number of random files. This shift of I/O access patterns poses several challenges to modern parallel storage systems. In this paper, we survey I/O in ML applications on HPC systems, and target literature within a 6-year time window from 2019 to 2024. We define the scope of the survey, provide an overview of the common phases of ML, review available profilers and benchmarks, examine the I/O patterns encountered during offline data preparation, training, and inference, and explore I/O optimizations utilized in modern ML frameworks and proposed in recent literature. Lastly, we seek to expose research gaps that could spawn further R&D.

### Benchmarking LLMs in Recommendation Tasks: A Comparative Evaluation with   Conventional Recommenders
**Authors**: Qijiong Liu, Jieming Zhu, Lu Fan, Kun Wang, Hengchang Hu, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:05:23Z

**Summary**: In recent years, integrating large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems has created new opportunities for improving recommendation quality. However, a comprehensive benchmark is needed to thoroughly evaluate and compare the recommendation capabilities of LLMs with traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RecBench, which systematically investigates various item representation forms (including unique identifier, text, semantic embedding, and semantic identifier) and evaluates two primary recommendation tasks, i.e., click-through rate prediction (CTR) and sequential recommendation (SeqRec). Our extensive experiments cover up to 17 large models and are conducted across five diverse datasets from fashion, news, video, books, and music domains. Our findings indicate that LLM-based recommenders outperform conventional recommenders, achieving up to a 5% AUC improvement in the CTR scenario and up to a 170% NDCG@10 improvement in the SeqRec scenario. However, these substantial performance gains come at the expense of significantly reduced inference efficiency, rendering the LLM-as-RS paradigm impractical for real-time recommendation environments. We aim for our findings to inspire future research, including recommendation-specific model acceleration methods. We will release our code, data, configurations, and platform to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our experimental results.

### Maximum Hallucination Standards for Domain-Specific Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Tingmingke Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:51:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate yet credible-sounding content, known as hallucinations. This inherent feature of LLMs poses significant risks, especially in critical domains. I analyze LLMs as a new class of engineering products, treating hallucinations as a product attribute. I demonstrate that, in the presence of imperfect awareness of LLM hallucinations and misinformation externalities, net welfare improves when the maximum acceptable level of LLM hallucinations is designed to vary with two domain-specific factors: the willingness to pay for reduced LLM hallucinations and the marginal damage associated with misinformation.

### MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Caching for LLM Web Services
**Authors**: Waris Gill, Mohamed Elidrisi, Pallavi Kalapatapu, Ammar Ahmed, Ali Anwar, Muhammad Ali Gulzar

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:49:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.

### Asymptotic expansions of solutions to Markov renewal equations and their   application to general branching processes
**Authors**: Konrad Kolesko, Matthias Meiners, Ivana Tomic

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:39:29Z

**Summary**: We consider the Markov renewal equation $F(t) = f(t) + \boldsymbol{\mu}*F(t)$ for vector-valued functions $f,F: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{p}$ and a $p \times p$ matrix $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ of locally finite measures $\mu^{i,j}$ on $[0,\infty)$, $i,j=1,\ldots,p$. Sgibnev [Semimultiplicative estimates for the solution of the multidimensional renewal equation. {\em Izv.\ Ross.\ Akad.\ Nauk Ser.\ Mat.}, 66(3):159--174, 2002] derived an asymptotic expansion for the solution $F$ to the above equation. We give a new, more elementary proof of Sgibnev's result, which also covers the reducible case. As a corollary, we infer an asymptotic expansion for the mean of a multi-type general branching process with finite type space counted with random characteristic.   Finally, some examples are discussed that illustrate phenomena of multi-type branching.

This task, evaluated on the DataBench dataset, assesses Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to answer natural language questions over structured data while addressing topic diversity and table size limitations in previous benchmarks. We propose a system that employs effective LLM prompting to translate natural language queries into executable code, enabling accurate responses, error correction, and interpretability. Our approach ranks first in both subtasks of the competition in the proprietary model category, significantly outperforming the organizer's baseline.

### Determining the Polarisation of a Coronal Standing Kink Oscillation   Using Spectral Imaging Techniques with the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter   (CoMP)
**Authors**: T. J. Duckenfield, D. B. Jess, R. J. Morton, S. Jafarzadeh

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:32:42Z

**Summary**: Coronal oscillations offer insight into energy transport and driving in the solar atmosphere. Knowing its polarisation state helps constrain a wave's displacement and velocity amplitude, improving estimates of wave energy flux and deposition rate. We demonstrate a method to combine imaging and spectral data to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop's standing kink wave, without the need for multiple instruments or multiple lines of sight. We use the unique capabilities of the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) to observe the standing kink mode of an off-limb coronal loop perturbed by an eruption. The full off-disk corona is observed using the 1074 nm Fe XIII spectral line, providing Doppler velocity, intensity and line width. By tracking the oscillatory motion of a loop apex in a time-distance map, we extract the line-of-sight (Doppler) velocity of the inhomogeneity as it sways and compare it with the derivative of its plane-of-sky displacement. This analysis provides the loop's velocity in two perpendicular planes as it oscillates with a period of $8.9^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ minutes. Through detailed analysis of the phase relation between the transverse velocities we infer the kink oscillation to be horizontally polarised, oscillating in a plane tilted $-13.6^{+2.9}_{-3.0}$ degrees away from the plane of sky. The line widths show a periodic enhancement during the kink oscillation, exhibiting both the kink period and its double. This study is the first to combine direct imaging and spectral data to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop oscillation from a single viewpoint.

### GazeNoter: Co-Piloted AR Note-Taking via Gaze Selection of LLM   Suggestions to Match Users' Intentions
**Authors**: Hsin-Ruey Tsai, Shih-Kang Chiu, Bryan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:24:06Z

**Summary**: Note-taking is critical during speeches and discussions, serving not only for later summarization and organization but also for real-time question and opinion reminding in question-and-answer sessions or timely contributions in discussions. Manually typing on smartphones for note-taking could be distracting and increase cognitive load for users. While large language models (LLMs) are used to automatically generate summaries and highlights, the content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) may not match users' intentions without user input or interaction. Therefore, we propose an AI-copiloted augmented reality (AR) system, GazeNoter, to allow users to swiftly select diverse LLM-generated suggestions via gaze on an AR headset for real-time note-taking. GazeNoter leverages an AR headset as a medium for users to swiftly adjust the LLM output to match their intentions, forming a user-in-the-loop AI system for both within-context and beyond-context notes. We conducted two user studies to verify the usability of GazeNoter in attending speeches in a static sitting condition and walking meetings and discussions in a mobile walking condition, respectively.

### Membership Inference Attacks Cannot Prove that a Model Was Trained On   Your Data
**Authors**: Jie Zhang, Debeshee Das, Gautam Kamath, Florian TramÃ¨r

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:20:23Z

**Summary**: We consider the problem of a training data proof, where a data creator or owner wants to demonstrate to a third party that some machine learning model was trained on their data. Training data proofs play a key role in recent lawsuits against foundation models trained on web-scale data. Many prior works suggest to instantiate training data proofs using membership inference attacks. We argue that this approach is fundamentally unsound: to provide convincing evidence, the data creator needs to demonstrate that their attack has a low false positive rate, i.e., that the attack's output is unlikely under the null hypothesis that the model was not trained on the target data. Yet, sampling from this null hypothesis is impossible, as we do not know the exact contents of the training set, nor can we (efficiently) retrain a large foundation model. We conclude by offering two paths forward, by showing that data extraction attacks and membership inference on special canary data can be used to create sound training data proofs.

**Authors**: Nenad Petrovic, Fengjunjie Pan, Vahid Zolfaghari, Alois Knoll

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:19:17Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to domain-specific metamodel construction relying on Large Language Model (LLM). The main focus is adoption in automotive domain. As outcome, a prototype was implemented as web service using Python programming language, while OpenAI's GPT-4o was used as the underlying LLM. Based on the initial experiments, this approach successfully constructs Ecore metamodel based on set of automotive requirements and visualizes it making use of PlantUML notation, so human experts can provide feedback in order to refine the result. Finally, locally deployable solution is also considered, including the limitations and additional steps required.

### LIFT: Improving Long Context Understanding of Large Language Models   through Long Input Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Yansheng Mao, Yufei Xu, Jiaqi Li, Fanxu Meng, Haotong Yang, Zilong Zheng, Xiyuan Wang, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:18:56Z

**Summary**: Long context understanding remains challenging for large language models due to their limited context windows. This paper presents Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT), a novel framework for long-context modeling that can improve the long-context performance of arbitrary (short-context) LLMs by dynamically adapting model parameters based on the long input. Importantly, LIFT, rather than endlessly extending the context window size to accommodate increasingly longer inputs in context, chooses to store and absorb the long input in parameter. By fine-tuning the long input into model parameters, LIFT allows short-context LLMs to answer questions even when the required information is not provided in the context during inference. Furthermore, to enhance LIFT performance while maintaining the original in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, we introduce Gated Memory, a specialized attention adapter that automatically balances long input memorization and ICL. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of LIFT on long context understanding, offering valuable directions for future research.

### Joint graphical model estimation using Stein-type shrinkage for fast   large scale network inference in scRNAseq data
**Authors**: Duong H. T. Vo, Nelofer Syed, Thomas Thorne

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:18:21Z

**Summary**: Graphical modeling is a widely used tool for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables and traditional methods may struggle to capture shared and distinct structures in multi-group or multi-condition settings. Joint graphical modeling (JGM) extends this framework by simultaneously estimating network structures across multiple related datasets, allowing for a deeper understanding of commonalities and differences. This capability is particularly valuable in fields such as genomics and neuroscience, where identifying variations in network topology can provide critical biological insights. Existing JGM methodologies largely fall into two categories: regularization-based approaches, which introduce additional penalties to enforce structured sparsity, and Bayesian frameworks, which incorporate prior knowledge to improve network inference. In this study, we explore an alternative method based on two-target linear covariance matrix shrinkage. Formula for optimal shrinkage intensities is proposed which leads to the development of JointStein framework. Performance of JointStein framework is proposed through simulation benchmarking which demonstrates its effectiveness for large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Finally, we apply our approach to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data, uncovering dynamic shifts in T cell network structures across disease progression stages. The result highlights potential of JointStein framework in extracting biologically meaningful insights from high-dimensional data.

### Are Your LLM-based Text-to-SQL Models Secure? Exploring SQL Injection   via Backdoor Attacks
**Authors**: Meiyu Lin, Haichuan Zhang, Jiale Lao, Renyuan Li, Yuanchun Zhou, Carl Yang, Yang Cao, Mingjie Tang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:16:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.

### An Empirical Study of Conformal Prediction in LLM with ASP Scaffolds for   Robust Reasoning
**Authors**: Navdeep Kaur, Lachlan McPheat, Alessandra Russo, Anthony G Cohn, Pranava Madhyastha

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:10:10Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we examine the use of Conformal Language Modelling (CLM) alongside Answer Set Programming (ASP) to enhance the performance of standard open-weight LLMs on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Using the StepGame dataset, which requires spatial reasoning, we apply CLM to generate sets of ASP programs from an LLM, providing statistical guarantees on the correctness of the outputs. Experimental results show that CLM significantly outperforms baseline models that use standard sampling methods, achieving substantial accuracy improvements across different levels of reasoning complexity. Additionally, the LLM-as-Judge metric enhances CLM's performance, especially in assessing structurally and logically correct ASP outputs. However, calibrating CLM with diverse calibration sets did not improve generalizability for tasks requiring much longer reasoning steps, indicating limitations in handling more complex tasks.

### Bootstrap inference for linear regression between variables that are   never jointly observed: application in in vivo experiments
**Authors**: Polina Arsenteva, Mohamed Amine Benadjaoud, HervÃ© Cardot

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:09:36Z

**Summary**: In modern experimental science, there is a common problem of estimating the coefficients of a linear regression in a context where the variables of interest cannot be observed simultaneously. When there is a categorical variable that is observed on all statistical units, we consider two estimators of linear regression that take this additional information into account: an estimator based on moments and an estimator based on optimal transport theory. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian under weak hypotheses. The asymptotic variance has no explicit expression, except in some special cases, for which reason a stratified bootstrap approach is developed to construct confidence intervals for the estimated parameters, whose consistency is also shown. A simulation study evaluating and comparing the finite sample performance of these estimators demonstrates the advantages of the bootstrap approach in several realistic scenarios. An application to in vivo experiments, conducted in the context of studying radio-induced adverse effects in mice, revealed important relationships between the biomarkers of interest that could not be identified with the considered naive approach.

### Wi-Fi 6 Cross-Technology Interference Detection and Mitigation by OFDMA:   an Experimental Study
**Authors**: Thijs Havinga, Xianjun Jiao, Wei Liu, Baiheng Chen, Adnan Shahid, Ingrid Moerman

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:58:58Z

**Summary**: Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) poses challenges for the performance and robustness of wireless networks. There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.

### ECCOS: Efficient Capability and Cost Coordinated Scheduling for   Multi-LLM Serving
**Authors**: Kai Mei, Wujiang Xu, Shuhang Lin, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:35:33Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as service endpoints in systems, the surge in query volume creates significant scheduling challenges. Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset collected for sample-wise response quality and costs by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time. The code is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/ECCOS.

### Static Program Analysis Guided LLM Based Unit Test Generation
**Authors**: Sujoy Roychowdhury, Giriprasad Sridhara, A K Raghavan, Joy Bose, Sourav Mazumdar, Hamender Singh, Srinivasan Bajji Sugumaran, Ricardo Britto

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:09:37Z

**Summary**: We describe a novel approach to automating unit test generation for Java methods using large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based approaches rely on sample usage(s) of the method to test (focal method) and/or provide the entire class of the focal method as input prompt and context. The former approach is often not viable due to the lack of sample usages, especially for newly written focal methods. The latter approach does not scale well enough; the bigger the complexity of the focal method and larger associated class, the harder it is to produce adequate test code (due to factors such as exceeding the prompt and context lengths of the underlying LLM). We show that augmenting prompts with \emph{concise} and \emph{precise} context information obtained by program analysis %of the focal method increases the effectiveness of generating unit test code through LLMs. We validate our approach on a large commercial Java project and a popular open-source Java project.

### Ontology Generation using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anna Sofia Lippolis, Mohammad Javad Saeedizade, Robin KeskisÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Sara Zuppiroli, Miguel Ceriani, Aldo Gangemi, Eva Blomqvist, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:03:28Z

**Summary**: The ontology engineering process is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone, even for experienced ontology engineers. In this work, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide effective OWL ontology drafts directly from ontological requirements described using user stories and competency questions. Our main contribution is the presentation and evaluation of two new prompting techniques for automated ontology development: Memoryless CQbyCQ and Ontogenia. We also emphasize the importance of three structural criteria for ontology assessment, alongside expert qualitative evaluation, highlighting the need for a multi-dimensional evaluation in order to capture the quality and usability of the generated ontologies. Our experiments, conducted on a benchmark dataset of ten ontologies with 100 distinct CQs and 29 different user stories, compare the performance of three LLMs using the two prompting techniques. The results demonstrate improvements over the current state-of-the-art in LLM-supported ontology engineering. More specifically, the model OpenAI o1-preview with Ontogenia produces ontologies of sufficient quality to meet the requirements of ontology engineers, significantly outperforming novice ontology engineers in modelling ability. However, we still note some common mistakes and variability of result quality, which is important to take into account when using LLMs for ontology authoring support. We discuss these limitations and propose directions for future research.

### Hints-In-Browser: Benchmarking Language Models for Programming Feedback   Generation
**Authors**: Nachiket Kotalwar, Alkis Gotovos, Adish Singla

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:46:14Z

**Summary**: Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.

### CrowdSurfer: Sampling Optimization Augmented with Vector-Quantized   Variational AutoEncoder for Dense Crowd Navigation
**Authors**: Naman Kumar, Antareep Singha, Laksh Nanwani, Dhruv Potdar, Tarun R, Fatemeh Rastgar, Simon Idoko, Arun Kumar Singh, K. Madhava Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:41:55Z

**Summary**: Navigation amongst densely packed crowds remains a challenge for mobile robots. The complexity increases further if the environment layout changes, making the prior computed global plan infeasible. In this paper, we show that it is possible to dramatically enhance crowd navigation by just improving the local planner. Our approach combines generative modelling with inference time optimization to generate sophisticated long-horizon local plans at interactive rates. More specifically, we train a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder to learn a prior over the expert trajectory distribution conditioned on the perception input. At run-time, this is used as an initialization for a sampling-based optimizer for further refinement. Our approach does not require any sophisticated prediction of dynamic obstacles and yet provides state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we compare against the recent DRL-VO approach and show a 40% improvement in success rate and a 6% improvement in travel time.

### Tailoring the breathing-mode distortions in nickelate-ferroelectric   heterostructures
**Authors**: Guillaume Krieger, Chia-Ping Su, Hoshang Sahib, Raymond Fan, Paul Steadman, Alexandre Gloter, Nathalie Viart, Daniele Preziosi

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:33:09Z

**Summary**: In transition metal oxides electron-electron interaction and lattice degree of freedom are basic ingredients of emergent phenomena, such as metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) and superconductivity. Perovskite rare-earth nickelates are largely studied for their temperature-driven MIT which is accompanied by a breathing mode distortion, and associated to a bond-disproportionation of the expanded (3d8L0) and compressed (3d8L2) NiO6 octahedra. Steric effects control the onset temperature of the MIT, the latter being concomitant or not with a complex antiferromagnetic spin arrangement depending upon the choice of the rare earth ion (TMIT>TNeel). Interface engineering of oxygen octahedra tilting, as imposed by the symmetry and orientation of the substrate, has resulted in an efficient pathway to modify both TMIT and TNeel, hence, suggesting a key role of the electron-phonon coupling for both transport and magnetic properties in nickelate thin films. Here, via a combination of resonant elastic X-ray scattering and transport experiments, we show a control over both TMIT and TNeel in heteroepitaxial PZT(d)/NNO(7 nm)//STO heterostructures, which are characterized by different strains and polarization states of the PZT layer grown at different thicknesses d. We found the expected NNO bulk behaviour, for a fully relaxed PZT layer showing a monodomain polarization state. On the other side, an almost 30 K difference, is found for a fully strained PZT characterized by a multidomain texture of the polarization state. We discuss our results in terms of an altered breathing distortion pattern of the underlying nickelate layer as supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. We infer that locally different polar distortions controlled by a combination of polarization direction and strength of the strain state play the main role in the observed TMIT and TNeel variations.

### Sustainable transparency in Recommender Systems: Bayesian Ranking of   Images for Explainability
**Authors**: Jorge Paz-Ruza, Amparo Alonso-Betanzos, Berta Guijarro-BerdiÃ±as, Brais Cancela, Carlos Eiras-Franco

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:31:27Z

**Summary**: Recommender Systems have become crucial in the modern world, commonly guiding users towards relevant content or products, and having a large influence over the decisions of users and citizens. However, ensuring transparency and user trust in these systems remains a challenge; personalized explanations have emerged as a solution, offering justifications for recommendations. Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using existing visual content created by users is a promising option to maximize transparency and user trust. State-of-the-art models that follow this approach, despite leveraging highly optimized architectures, employ surrogate learning tasks that do not efficiently model the objective of ranking images as explanations for a given recommendation; this leads to a suboptimal training process with high computational costs that may not be reduced without affecting model performance. This work presents BRIE, a novel model where we leverage Bayesian Pairwise Ranking to enhance the training process, allowing us to consistently outperform state-of-the-art models in six real-world datasets while reducing its model size by up to 64 times and its CO2 emissions by up to 75% in training and inference.

### Bridging Text and Vision: A Multi-View Text-Vision Registration Approach   for Cross-Modal Place Recognition
**Authors**: Tianyi Shang, Zhenyu Li, Pengjie Xu, Jinwei Qiao, Gang Chen, Zihan Ruan, Weijun Hu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:30:18Z

**Summary**: Mobile robots necessitate advanced natural language understanding capabilities to accurately identify locations and perform tasks such as package delivery. However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.

### Shifting Perspectives: Steering Vector Ensembles for Robust Bias   Mitigation in LLMs
**Authors**: Zara Siddique, Irtaza Khalid, Liam D. Turner, Luis Espinosa-Anke

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:25:29Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We employ Bayesian optimization to systematically identify effective contrastive pair datasets across nine bias axes. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.2%, 4.7%, and 3.2% over the baseline for Mistral, Llama, and Qwen, respectively. Building on these promising results, we introduce Steering Vector Ensembles (SVE), a method that averages multiple individually optimized steering vectors, each targeting a specific bias axis such as age, race, or gender. By leveraging their collective strength, SVE outperforms individual steering vectors in both bias reduction and maintaining model performance. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that SVE is a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.

### Multi-Grained Feature Pruning for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation
**Authors**: Zhigang Wang, Shaojing Fan, Zhenguang Liu, Zheqi Wu, Sifan Wu, Yingying Jiao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:14:51Z

**Summary**: Human pose estimation, with its broad applications in action recognition and motion capture, has experienced significant advancements. However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.

### Proof-theoretic Semantics for Classical Propositional Logic with   Assertion and Denial
**Authors**: Alexander V. Gheorghiu, Yll Buzoku

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:11:12Z

**Summary**: The field of proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) offers an alternative approach to meaning in logic that is based on inference and argument (rather than truth in a model). It has been successfully developed for various logics; in particular, Sandqvist has developed such semantics for both classical and intuitionistic logic. In the case of classical logic, P-tS provides a conception of consequence that avoids an \emph{a priori} commitment to the principle of bivalence, addressing what Dummett identified as a significant foundational challenge in logic. In this paper, we propose an alternative P-tS for classical logic, which essentially extends the P-tS for intuitionistic logic by operating over literals rather than atomic propositions. Importantly, literals are atomic and not defined by negation but are defined by inferential relationships. This semantics illustrates the perspective that classical logic can be understood as intuitionistic logic supplemented by a principle of duality, offering fresh insights into the relationship between these two systems.

### Chain of Strategy Optimization Makes Large Language Models Better   Emotional Supporter
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhao, Xingyu Sui, Xinyang Han, Yang Deng, Yulin Hu, Jiahe Guo, Libo Qin, Qianyun Du, Shijin Wang, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:07:59Z

**Summary**: The growing emotional stress in modern society has increased the demand for Emotional Support Conversations (ESC). While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for ESC, they face two key challenges: (1) low strategy selection accuracy, and (2) preference bias, limiting their adaptability to emotional needs of users. Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles to address these issues, as it rigidly trains models on single gold-standard responses without modeling nuanced strategy trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Strategy Optimization (CSO), a novel approach that optimizes strategy selection preferences at each dialogue turn. We first leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct ESC-Pro, a high-quality preference dataset with turn-level strategy-response pairs. Training on ESC-Pro with CSO improves both strategy accuracy and bias mitigation, enabling LLMs to generate more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9B, and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that CSO outperforms standard SFT, highlighting the efficacy of fine-grained, turn-level preference modeling in ESC.

### On an Inferential Semantics for Intuitionistic Sentential Logic
**Authors**: Alexander V. Gheorghiu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:03:43Z

**Summary**: Sandqvist's base-extension semantics (B-eS) for intuitionistic sentential logic grounds meaning relative to bases (rather than, say, models), which are arbitrary sets of permitted inferences over sentences. While his soundness proof is standard, his completeness proof, is quite unusual. It closely parallels a method introduced much earlier by Mints, who developed a resolution-based approach to intuitionistic logic using a systematic translation of formulas into sentential counterparts. In this short note, we highlight the connection between these two approaches and show that the soundness and completeness of B-eS follow directly from Mints' theorem. While the result is modest, it reinforces the relevance of proof-search to proof-theoretic semantics and suggests that resolution methods have a deeper conceptual role in constructive reasoning than is often acknowledged.

### GEMA-Score: Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score for Radiology Report   Evaluation
**Authors**: Zhenxuan Zhang, Kinhei Lee, Weihang Deng, Huichi Zhou, Zihao Jin, Jiahao Huang, Zhifan Gao, Dominic C Marshall, Yingying Fang, Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:42:22Z

**Summary**: Automatic medical report generation supports clinical diagnosis, reduces the workload of radiologists, and holds the promise of improving diagnosis consistency. However, existing evaluation metrics primarily assess the accuracy of key medical information coverage in generated reports compared to human-written reports, while overlooking crucial details such as the location and certainty of reported abnormalities. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs NER-F1 calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = 0.70 for Rexval dataset and Kendall coefficient = 0.54 for RadEvalX dataset).

### Speculative MoE: Communication Efficient Parallel MoE Inference with   Speculative Token and Expert Pre-scheduling
**Authors**: Yan Li, Pengfei Zheng, Shuang Chen, Zewei Xu, Yuanhao Lai, Yunfei Du, Zhengang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:41:53Z

**Summary**: MoE (Mixture of Experts) prevails as a neural architecture that can scale modern transformer-based LLMs (Large Language Models) to unprecedented scales. Nevertheless, large MoEs' great demands of computing power, memory capacity and memory bandwidth make scalable serving a fundamental challenge and efficient parallel inference has become a requisite to attain adequate throughput under latency constraints. DeepSpeed-MoE, one state-of-the-art MoE inference framework, adopts a 3D-parallel paradigm including EP (Expert Parallelism), TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallelism). However, our analysis shows DeepSpeed-MoE's inference efficiency is largely bottlenecked by EP, which is implemented with costly all-to-all collectives to route token activation. Our work aims to boost DeepSpeed-MoE by strategically reducing EP's communication overhead with a technique named Speculative MoE. Speculative MoE has two speculative parallelization schemes, speculative token shuffling and speculative expert grouping, which predict outstanding tokens' expert routing paths and pre-schedule tokens and experts across devices to losslessly trim EP's communication volume. Besides DeepSpeed-MoE, we also build Speculative MoE into a prevailing MoE inference engine SGLang. Experiments show Speculative MoE can significantly boost state-of-the-art MoE inference frameworks on fast homogeneous and slow heterogeneous interconnects.

### AutoIOT: LLM-Driven Automated Natural Language Programming for AIoT   Applications
**Authors**: Leming Shen, Qiang Yang, Yuanqing Zheng, Mo Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:40:52Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed our lives, revolutionizing interactions with AI and lowering the barrier to AI usage. While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the extensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data. This capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this evolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application development, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design and development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some limitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT application development. First, existing solutions often require transferring raw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high query fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of LLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and correctness of inference results. This paper introduces AutoIOT, an LLM-based automated program generator for AIoT applications. AutoIOT enables users to specify their requirements using natural language (input) and automatically synthesizes interpretable programs with documentation (output). AutoIOT automates the iterative optimization to enhance the quality of generated code with minimum user involvement. AutoIOT not only makes the execution of AIoT tasks more explainable but also mitigates privacy concerns and reduces token costs with local execution of synthesized programs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate AutoIOT's remarkable capability in program synthesis for various AIoT tasks. The synthesized programs can match and even outperform some representative baselines.

### Characterising planetary material accreted by cool helium atmosphere   white dwarfs using an exponentially decaying disc model
**Authors**: Mairi W. O'Brien, Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay, Beth L. Klein, Carl Melis, Detlev Koester, Andrew M. Buchan, Dimitri Veras, Alexandra E. Doyle

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:39:01Z

**Summary**: We present Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) observations and model atmosphere analysis for two nearby, cool, helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that have been polluted by accretion: WD J1927-0355 and WD J2141-3300. Detected elements common to both white dwarfs are Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with additional detections of Na, Al, Si and Sr in WD J2141-3300. We present an approach for inferring the composition of the accreted material, by adopting a physically motivated model in which the mass accretion rate decays exponentially with time, which provides constraints on the time since the start of the accretion event. The accretion events were most likely to have began at least 1 Myr ago, however the characteristic disc lifetime could not be constrained due to degeneracies. Both white dwarfs were found to have accreted bulk planetary material with compositions similar to that of both bulk Earth and chondritic meteorites. The parent bodies causing pollution in both cases were inferred to be the mass of a small moon or dwarf planet.

### LLM-as-BT-Planner: Leveraging LLMs for Behavior Tree Generation in Robot   Task Planning
**Authors**: Jicong Ao, Fan Wu, Yansong Wu, Abdalla Swikir, Sami Haddadin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:32:55Z

**Summary**: Robotic assembly tasks remain an open challenge due to their long horizon nature and complex part relations. Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

### The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty
**Authors**: Ken Kangda Wren

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:26:20Z

**Summary**: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies such as Moment and Low-Risk.

### EdgeMoE: Empowering Sparse Large Language Models on Mobile Devices
**Authors**: Rongjie Yi, Liwei Guo, Shiyun Wei, Ao Zhou, Shangguang Wang, Mengwei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:16:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs and Mixtral-8x7B have revolutionized machine intelligence due to their exceptional abilities in generic ML tasks. Transiting LLMs from datacenters to edge devices brings benefits like better privacy and availability, but is challenged by their massive parameter size and thus unbearable runtime costs. To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs -- a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline. On popular MoE LLMs and edge devices, EdgeMoE showcase significant memory savings and speedup over competitive baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/mllm.

**Authors**: Yiwei Li, Jiayi Shi, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Yueqi Zhang, Ji Zhang, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Yao Hu, Kan Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:15:36Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel speculative decoding method tailored for multi-sample reasoning scenarios, such as self-consistency and Best-of-N sampling. Our method exploits the intrinsic consensus of parallel generation paths to synthesize high-quality draft tokens without requiring auxiliary models or external databases. By dynamically analyzing structural patterns across parallel reasoning paths through a probabilistic aggregation mechanism, it identifies consensus token sequences that align with the decoding distribution. Evaluations on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate a substantial improvement in draft acceptance rates over baselines, while reducing the latency in draft token construction. This work establishes a paradigm shift for efficient multi-sample inference, enabling seamless integration of speculative decoding with sampling-based reasoning techniques.

### Dynamic Knowledge Integration for Evidence-Driven Counter-Argument   Generation with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:13:33Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the role of dynamic external knowledge integration in improving counter-argument generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate lengthy, potentially unfactual responses highlights the need for more controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a new manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and reliable counter-argumentation systems.

**Authors**: Siwei Wu, Yizhi Li, Xingwei Qu, Rishi Ravikumar, Yucheng Li, Tyler Loakman, Shanghaoran Quan, Xiaoyong Wei, Riza Batista-Navarro, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:05:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to generate long-form content remains poorly understood and evaluated. Our analysis reveals that current LLMs struggle with length requirements and information density in long-text generation, with performance deteriorating as text length increases. To quantitively locate such a performance degradation and provide further insights on model development, we present LongEval, a benchmark that evaluates long-text generation through both direct and plan-based generation paradigms, inspired by cognitive and linguistic writing models. The comprehensive experiments in this work reveal interesting findings such as that while model size correlates with generation ability, the small-scale model (e.g., LongWriter), well-trained on long texts, has comparable performance. All code and datasets are released in https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/LongEval.

### Routing for Large ML Models
**Authors**: Ofir Cohen, Jose Yallouz Michael Schapira, Shahar Belkar, Tal Mizrahi

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:02:17Z

**Summary**: Training large language models (LLMs), and other large machine learning models, involves repeated communication of large volumes of data across a data center network. The communication patterns induced by these training process exhibit high regularity and persistence, giving rise to significant opportunities for optimizing the manner in which flows are routed across the network. We present an algorithmic framework for \textit{quantifying} network-wide efficiency in the context of training LLMs (and other large-scale ML models), and for periodically \textit{optimizing} routing with respect to this global metric.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:01:00Z

**Summary**: In intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT), blood residues and gas bubbles cause attenuation artifacts that can obscure critical vessel structures. The presence and severity of these artifacts may warrant re-acquisition, prolonging procedure time and increasing use of contrast agent. Accurate detection of these artifacts can guide targeted re-acquisition, reducing the amount of repeated scans needed to achieve diagnostically viable images. However, the highly heterogeneous appearance of these artifacts poses a challenge for the automated detection of the affected image regions. To enable automatic detection of the attenuation artifacts caused by blood residues and gas bubbles based on their severity, we propose a convolutional neural network that performs classification of the attenuation lines (A-lines) into three classes: no artifact, mild artifact and severe artifact. Our model extracts and merges features from OCT images in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, where each column of the image represents an A-line. Our method detects the presence of attenuation artifacts in OCT frames reaching F-scores of 0.77 and 0.94 for mild and severe artifacts, respectively. The inference time over a full OCT scan is approximately 6 seconds. Our experiments show that analysis of images represented in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems outperforms the analysis in polar coordinates only, suggesting that these representations contain complementary features. This work lays the foundation for automated artifact assessment and image acquisition guidance in intracoronary OCT imaging.

### Riemannian Metric Learning: Closer to You than You Imagine
**Authors**: Samuel Gruffaz, Josua Sassen

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:00:29Z

**Summary**: Riemannian metric learning is an emerging field in machine learning, unlocking new ways to encode complex data structures beyond traditional distance metric learning. While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.

### Frequency Autoregressive Image Generation with Continuous Tokens
**Authors**: Hu Yu, Hao Luo, Hangjie Yuan, Yu Rong, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:34:04Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) models for image generation typically adopt a two-stage paradigm of vector quantization and raster-scan ``next-token prediction", inspired by its great success in language modeling. However, due to the huge modality gap, image autoregressive models may require a systematic reevaluation from two perspectives: tokenizer format and regression direction. In this paper, we introduce the frequency progressive autoregressive (\textbf{FAR}) paradigm and instantiate FAR with the continuous tokenizer. Specifically, we identify spectral dependency as the desirable regression direction for FAR, wherein higher-frequency components build upon the lower one to progressively construct a complete image. This design seamlessly fits the causality requirement for autoregressive models and preserves the unique spatial locality of image data. Besides, we delve into the integration of FAR and the continuous tokenizer, introducing a series of techniques to address optimization challenges and improve the efficiency of training and inference processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of FAR through comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset and verify its potential on text-to-image generation.

### Evaluating and Utilizing Surrogate Outcomes in Covariate-Adjusted   Response-Adaptive Designs
**Authors**: Wenxin Zhang, Aaron Hudson, Maya Petersen, Mark van der Laan

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:33:24Z

**Summary**: Surrogate outcomes have long been studied as substitutes for long-term primary outcomes. However, current surrogate evaluation methods do not directly account for their benefits in updating treatment randomization probabilities in adaptive experiments that aim to learn and respond to treatment effect heterogeneity. In this context, surrogate outcomes can expedite updates to randomization probabilities and thus improve expected outcomes of newly-enrolled participants by enabling earlier detection of heterogeneous treatment effects. We introduce a novel approach for evaluating candidate surrogate outcomes that quantifies both of these benefits in sequential adaptive experiments. We also propose a new Covariate-Adjusted Response-Adaptive design that uses an Online-Superlearner to evaluate and adaptively select surrogate outcomes for updating treatment randomization probabilities during the trial. We further introduce a Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation method that addresses dependence in adaptively collected data and achieves asymptotic normality without parametric assumptions. Our design and estimation methods show robust performance in simulations, including those using real trial data. Overall, this framework not only provides a comprehensive way to quantify benefits and select among candidate surrogate outcomes, but also offers a general tool for evaluating various adaptive designs with inferences, providing insights into opportunities and costs of alternative designs that could have been implemented.

Recently, it has also been studied as an objective function for parametric estimation, as it has been shown to yield robust estimators. We have implemented MMD minimization for parameter inference in a wide range of statistical models, including various regression models, within an R package called regMMD. This paper provides an introduction to the regMMD package. We describe the available kernels and optimization procedures, as well as the default settings. Detailed applications to simulated and real data are provided.

### Are AI Detectors Good Enough? A Survey on Quality of Datasets With   Machine-Generated Texts
**Authors**: German Gritsai, Anastasia Voznyuk, Andrey Grabovoy, Yury Chekhovich

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:17:34Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the quality of generated texts, necessitating reliable machine-generated text detectors. A huge number of detectors and collections with AI fragments have emerged, and several detection methods even showed recognition quality up to 99.9% according to the target metrics in such collections. However, the quality of such detectors tends to drop dramatically in the wild, posing a question: Are detectors actually highly trustworthy or do their high benchmark scores come from the poor quality of evaluation datasets? In this paper, we emphasise the need for robust and qualitative methods for evaluating generated data to be secure against bias and low generalising ability of future model. We present a systematic review of datasets from competitions dedicated to AI-generated content detection and propose methods for evaluating the quality of datasets containing AI-generated fragments. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data to achieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving the training datasets themselves. Our contribution aims to facilitate a better understanding of the dynamics between human and machine text, which will ultimately support the integrity of information in an increasingly automated world.

### Towards Autonomous Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic   Manipulation with Large Language Models
**Authors**: NiccolÃ² Turcato, Matteo Iovino, Aris Synodinos, Alberto Dalla Libera, Ruggero Carli, Pietro Falco

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:06:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.

### Learning Force Distribution Estimation for the GelSight Mini Optical   Tactile Sensor Based on Finite Element Analysis
**Authors**: Erik Helmut, Luca Dziarski, Niklas Funk, Boris Belousov, Jan Peters

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:05:23Z

**Summary**: Contact-rich manipulation remains a major challenge in robotics. Optical tactile sensors like GelSight Mini offer a low-cost solution for contact sensing by capturing soft-body deformations of the silicone gel. However, accurately inferring shear and normal force distributions from these gel deformations has yet to be fully addressed. In this work, we propose a machine learning approach using a U-net architecture to predict force distributions directly from the sensor's raw images. Our model, trained on force distributions inferred from Finite Element Analysis (FEA), demonstrates promising accuracy in predicting normal and shear force distributions for the commercially available GelSight Mini sensor. It also shows potential for generalization across indenters, sensors of the same type, and for enabling real-time application. The codebase, dataset and models are open-sourced and available at https://feats-ai.github.io .

### RoToR: Towards More Reliable Responses for Order-Invariant Inputs
**Authors**: Soyoung Yoon, Dongha Ahn, Youngwon Lee, Minkyu Jung, HyungJoo Jang, Seung-won Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:55:19Z

**Summary**: Mitigating positional bias of language models (LMs) for listwise inputs is a well-known and important problem (e.g., lost-in-the-middle). While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to a mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner.

### Similarity-Based Domain Adaptation with LLMs
**Authors**: Jie He, Wendi Zhou, Xiang Lorraine Li, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:51:07Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation leverages abundant labeled data from various source domains to generalize onto unlabeled target data. Prior research has primarily focused on learning domain-invariant features across the source and target domains. However, these methods often require training a model using source domain data, which is time-consuming and can limit model usage for applications with different source data. This paper introduces a simple framework that utilizes the impressive generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for target data annotation without the need of source model training, followed by a novel similarity-based knowledge distillation loss. Our extensive experiments on cross-domain text classification reveal that our framework achieves impressive performance, specifically, 2.44\% accuracy improvement when compared to the SOTA method.

### Revealing Hidden Mechanisms of Cross-Country Content Moderation with   Natural Language Processing
**Authors**: Neemesh Yadav, Jiarui Liu, Francesco Ortu, Roya Ensafi, Zhijing Jin, Rada Mihalcea

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:49:31Z

**Summary**: The ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to categorize text into multiple classes has motivated their use in online content moderation tasks, such as hate speech and fake news detection. However, there is limited understanding of how or why these methods make such decisions, or why certain content is moderated in the first place. To investigate the hidden mechanisms behind content moderation, we explore multiple directions: 1) training classifiers to reverse-engineer content moderation decisions across countries; 2) explaining content moderation decisions by analyzing Shapley values and LLM-guided explanations. Our primary focus is on content moderation decisions made across countries, using pre-existing corpora sampled from the Twitter Stream Grab. Our experiments reveal interesting patterns in censored posts, both across countries and over time. Through human evaluations of LLM-generated explanations across three LLMs, we assess the effectiveness of using LLMs in content moderation. Finally, we discuss potential future directions, as well as the limitations and ethical considerations of this work. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/causalNLP/censorship

### Evidential Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction
**Authors**: Sajad Marvi, Christoph Rist, Julian Schmidt, Julian Jordan, Abhinav Valada

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:46:21Z

**Summary**: Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.

### Ticktack : Long Span Temporal Alignment of Large Language Models   Leveraging Sexagenary Cycle Time Expression
**Authors**: Xue Han, Qian Hu, Yitong Wang, Wenchun Gao, Lianlian Zhang, Qing Wang, Lijun Mei, Chao Deng, Junlan Feng

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:37:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

**Authors**: Francesco Cazzaro, Justin Kleindienst, Sofia Marquez, Ariadna Quattoni

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:33:30Z

**Summary**: Natural language interfaces to knowledge graphs have become increasingly important in recent years, enabling easy and efficient access to structured data. In particular property graphs have seen growing adoption. However, these kind of graphs remain relatively underrepresented in research, which has focused in large part on RDF-style graphs. As a matter of fact there is a lack of resources for evaluating systems on property graphs, with many existing datasets featuring relatively simple queries. To address this gap, we introduce ZOGRASCOPE, a benchmark designed specifically for the cypher query language. The benchmark includes a diverse set of manually annotated queries of varying complexity. We complement this paper with a set of experiments that test the performance of out-of-the-box LLMs of different sizes. Our experiments show that semantic parsing over graphs is still a challenging open problem that can not be solved by prompting LLMs alone.

 ### Bias Unveiled: Investigating Social Bias in LLM-Generated Code
**Authors**: Lin Ling, Fazle Rabbi, Song Wang, Jinqiu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:59:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in evaluating social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several prompting strategies for mitigating bias, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and dialogue with Solar. Our experiments show that dialogue with Solar can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Last, we make the code and data publicly available is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.

### Understanding the Limits of Lifelong Knowledge Editing in LLMs
**Authors**: Lukas Thede, Karsten Roth, Matthias Bethge, Zeynep Akata, Tom Hartvigsen

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:45:42Z

**Summary**: Keeping large language models factually up-to-date is crucial for deployment, yet costly retraining remains a challenge. Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.

### AIM-Fair: Advancing Algorithmic Fairness via Selectively Fine-Tuning   Biased Models with Contextual Synthetic Data
**Authors**: Zengqun Zhao, Ziquan Liu, Yu Cao, Shaogang Gong, Ioannis Patras

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:26:48Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.

### A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and   Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Shutong Qiao, Jiaqi Zhang, Tzu-Heng Lin, Chen Gao, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:20:30Z

**Summary**: Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over the past two decades, search and recommendation systems (collectively referred to as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language model agents in enhancing search and recommendation systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing current challenges in search and recommendation, providing insights into future research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers on agent-based simulation with large language models at this link: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-for-Recommendation-and-Search.

### START: Self-taught Reasoner with Tools
**Authors**: Chengpeng Li, Mingfeng Xue, Zhenru Zhang, Jiaxi Yang, Beichen Zhang, Xiang Wang, Bowen Yu, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin, Dayiheng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:13:22Z

**Summary**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through the utilization of long Chain-of-thought (CoT). However, these models often suffer from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA (GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary model o1-Preview.

### Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for   Heterogeneous Reasoning
**Authors**: Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Sukwon Yun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T18:03:13Z

**Summary**: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

### LLMorpheus: Mutation Testing using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Frank Tip, Jonathan Bell, Max Schaefer

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:48:47Z

**Summary**: In mutation testing, the quality of a test suite is evaluated by introducing faults into a program and determining whether the program's tests detect them. Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a "+" with a "-", or removing a function's body. However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a technique for mutation testing where placeholders are introduced at designated locations in a program's source code and where a Large Language Model (LLM) is prompted to ask what they could be replaced with. The technique is implemented in LLMorpheus, a mutation testing tool for JavaScript, and evaluated on 13 subject packages, considering several variations on the prompting strategy, and using several LLMs. We find LLMorpheus to be capable of producing mutants that resemble existing bugs that cannot be produced by StrykerJS, a state-of-the-art mutation testing tool. Moreover, we report on the running time, cost, and number of mutants produced by LLMorpheus, demonstrating its practicality.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:47:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DeFT.

### Learning LLM Preference over Intra-Dialogue Pairs: A Framework for   Utterance-level Understandings
**Authors**: Xuanqing Liu, Luyang Kong, Wei Niu, Afshin Khashei, Belinda Zeng, Steve Johnson, Jon Jay, Davor Golac, Matt Pope

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:46:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex dialogue tasks without requiring use case-specific fine-tuning. However, analyzing live dialogues in real-time necessitates low-latency processing systems, making it impractical to deploy models with billions of parameters due to latency constraints. As a result, practitioners often prefer smaller models with millions of parameters, trained on high-quality, human-annotated datasets. Yet, curating such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to combine the scalability of LLM-generated labels with the precision of human annotations, enabling fine-tuned smaller models to achieve both higher speed and accuracy comparable to larger models. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework to address this challenge. Our approach is specifically designed for per-utterance classification problems, which encompass tasks such as intent detection, dialogue state tracking, and more. To mitigate the impact of labeling errors from LLMs -- the primary source of inaccuracies in student models -- we propose a noise-reduced preference learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy across utterance-level dialogue tasks, including sentiment detection (over $2\%$), dialogue act classification (over $1.5\%$), etc.

### A Survey on Sparse Autoencoders: Interpreting the Internal Mechanisms of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:38:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of SAEs as a promising approach to interpreting and understanding LLMs. We provide a systematic overview of SAE principles, architectures, and applications specifically tailored for LLM analysis, covering theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and recent developments in sparsity mechanisms. We also explore how SAEs can be leveraged to explain the internal workings of LLMs, steer model behaviors in desired directions, and develop more transparent training methodologies for future models. Despite the challenges that remain around SAE implementation and scaling, they continue to provide valuable tools for understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models.

### Language Models Enable Simple Systems for Generating Structured Views of   Heterogeneous Data Lakes
**Authors**: Simran Arora, Brandon Yang, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avanika Narayan, Andrew Hojel, Immanuel Trummer, Christopher RÃ©

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:33:50Z

**Summary**: A long standing goal of the data management community is to develop general, automated systems that ingest semi-structured documents and output queryable tables without human effort or domain specific customization. Given the sheer variety of potential documents, state-of-the art systems make simplifying assumptions and use domain specific training. In this work, we ask whether we can maintain generality by using large language models (LLMs). LLMs, which are pretrained on broad data, can perform diverse downstream tasks simply conditioned on natural language task descriptions.   We propose and evaluate EVAPORATE, a simple, prototype system powered by LLMs. We identify two fundamentally different strategies for implementing this system: prompt the LLM to directly extract values from documents or prompt the LLM to synthesize code that performs the extraction. Our evaluations show a cost-quality tradeoff between these two approaches. Code synthesis is cheap, but far less accurate than directly processing each document with the LLM. To improve quality while maintaining low cost, we propose an extended code synthesis implementation, EVAPORATE-CODE+, which achieves better quality than direct extraction. Our key insight is to generate many candidate functions and ensemble their extractions using weak supervision. EVAPORATE-CODE+ not only outperforms the state-of-the art systems, but does so using a sublinear pass over the documents with the LLM. This equates to a 110x reduction in the number of tokens the LLM needs to process, averaged across 16 real-world evaluation settings of 10k documents each.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:24:35Z

**Summary**: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:14:44Z

**Summary**: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.

### Quantifying the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models   Against Spurious Features in Grounding Data
**Authors**: Shiping Yang, Jie Wu, Wenbiao Ding, Ning Wu, Shining Liang, Ming Gong, Hengyuan Zhang, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:11:34Z

**Summary**: Robustness has become a critical attribute for the deployment of RAG systems in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on robustness to explicit noise (e.g., document semantics) but overlooks spurious features (a.k.a. implicit noise). While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs, they are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios (e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious features in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through controlled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features are harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes. Extensive evaluation results across multiple LLMs suggest that spurious features are a widespread and challenging problem in the field of RAG. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research. We release all codes and data at: $\\\href{https://github.com/maybenotime/RAG-SpuriousFeatures}{https://github.com/maybenotime/RAG-SpuriousFeatures}$.

### AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models
**Authors**: Junfeng Fang, Houcheng Jiang, Kun Wang, Yunshan Ma, Shi Jie, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Tat-seng Chua

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T17:06:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.4% with a single line of additional code for projection solely. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AlphaEdit.

### Compliance of AI Systems
**Authors**: Julius SchÃ¶ning, Niklas Kruse

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:53:36Z

**Summary**: The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in various fields requires solid concepts to ensure compliance with upcoming legislation. This paper systematically examines the compliance of AI systems with relevant legislation, focusing on the EU's AI Act and the compliance of data sets. The analysis highlighted many challenges associated with edge devices, which are increasingly being used to deploy AI applications closer and closer to the data sources. Such devices often face unique issues due to their decentralized nature and limited computing resources for implementing sophisticated compliance mechanisms. By analyzing AI implementations, the paper identifies challenges and proposes the first best practices for legal compliance when developing, deploying, and running AI. The importance of data set compliance is highlighted as a cornerstone for ensuring the trustworthiness, transparency, and explainability of AI systems, which must be aligned with ethical standards set forth in regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. The insights gained should contribute to the ongoing discourse on the responsible development and deployment of embedded AI systems.

### Evaluating open-source Large Language Models for automated fact-checking
**Authors**: Nicolo' Fontana, Francesco Corso, Enrico Zuccolotto, Francesco Pierri

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:45:33Z

**Summary**: The increasing prevalence of online misinformation has heightened the demand for automated fact-checking solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for assisting in this task, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This study evaluates the fact-checking capabilities of various open-source LLMs, focusing on their ability to assess claims with different levels of contextual information. We conduct three key experiments: (1) evaluating whether LLMs can identify the semantic relationship between a claim and a fact-checking article, (2) assessing models' accuracy in verifying claims when given a related fact-checking article, and (3) testing LLMs' fact-checking abilities when leveraging data from external knowledge sources such as Google and Wikipedia. Our results indicate that LLMs perform well in identifying claim-article connections and verifying fact-checked stories but struggle with confirming factual news, where they are outperformed by traditional fine-tuned models such as RoBERTa. Additionally, the introduction of external knowledge does not significantly enhance LLMs' performance, calling for more tailored approaches. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automated fact-checking, emphasizing the need for further refinements before they can reliably replace human fact-checkers.

**Summary**: Whether LLMs memorize their training data and what this means, from measuring privacy leakage to detecting copyright violations, has become a rapidly growing area of research. In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.

### Revitalizing Saturated Benchmarks: A Weighted Metric Approach for   Differentiating Large Language Model Performance
**Authors**: Bryan Etzine, Masoud Hashemi, Nishanth Madhusudhan, Sagar Davasam, Roshnee Sharma, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Vikas Yadav

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:25:09Z

**Summary**: Existing benchmarks are becoming saturated and struggle to separate model performances due to factors like data contamination and advancing LLM capabilities. This paper introduces EMDM (Enhanced Model Differentiation Metric), a novel weighted metric that revitalizes benchmarks by enhancing model separation. EMDM integrates final answer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning correctness, assigning weights based on the complexity and reasoning depth required to solve a given sample in the evaluation data. Using a baseline LLM in two setups-Unguided, where the model has no prior exposure to test samples, and Guided, where the model has prior knowledge of the desired answer-EMDM distinguishes instances of varying difficulty. The CoT and answer correctness from these setups inform an optimization objective for weight assignment, resulting in a more nuanced evaluation of model performance. Compared to the exact match (EM) metric, which achieves 17% separation on ARC-Challenge, EMDM achieves 46%, demonstrating its effectiveness in differentiating models based on reasoning and knowledge requirements.

### Pi-GPS: Enhancing Geometry Problem Solving by Unleashing the Power of   Diagrammatic Information
**Authors**: Junbo Zhao, Ting Zhang, Jiayu Sun, Mi Tian, Hua Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T16:15:00Z

**Summary**: Geometry problem solving has garnered increasing attention due to its potential applications in intelligent education field. Inspired by the observation that text often introduces ambiguities that diagrams can clarify, this paper presents Pi-GPS, a novel framework that unleashes the power of diagrammatic information to resolve textual ambiguities, an aspect largely overlooked in prior research. Specifically, we design a micro module comprising a rectifier and verifier: the rectifier employs MLLMs to disambiguate text based on the diagrammatic context, while the verifier ensures the rectified output adherence to geometric rules, mitigating model hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the impact of LLMs in theorem predictor based on the disambiguated formal language. Empirical results demonstrate that Pi-GPS surpasses state-of-the-art models, achieving a nearly 10\% improvement on Geometry3K over prior neural-symbolic approaches. We hope this work highlights the significance of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical reasoning, a crucial factor limiting performance.

**Authors**: Alex Fedorov, Yutong Bu, Xiao Hu, Chris Rorden, Sergey Plis

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:58:36Z

**Summary**: Efficient and accurate whole-brain lesion segmentation remains a challenge in medical image analysis. In this work, we revisit MeshNet, a parameter-efficient segmentation model, and introduce a novel multi-scale dilation pattern with an encoder-decoder structure. This innovation enables capturing broad contextual information and fine-grained details without traditional downsampling, upsampling, or skip-connections. Unlike previous approaches processing subvolumes or slices, we operate directly on whole-brain $256^3$ MRI volumes. Evaluations on the Aphasia Recovery Cohort (ARC) dataset demonstrate that MeshNet achieves superior or comparable DICE scores to state-of-the-art architectures such as MedNeXt and U-MAMBA at 1/1000th of parameters. Our results validate MeshNet's strong balance of efficiency and performance, making it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments such as web-based applications and opening new possibilities for the widespread deployment of advanced medical image analysis tools.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:54:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. We evaluate Proximity on the MMLU and MedRAG benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining response accuracy. Proximity reduces retrieval latency by up to 59% while maintaining accuracy and lowers the computational burden on the vector database. We also experiment with different similarity thresholds and quantify the trade-off between speed and recall. Our work shows that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### PoSSUM: A Protocol for Surveying Social-media Users with Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Roberto Cerina

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:49:56Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces PoSSUM, an open-source protocol for unobtrusive polling of social-media users via multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). PoSSUM leverages users' real-time posts, images, and other digital traces to create silicon samples that capture information not present in the LLM's training data. To obtain representative estimates, PoSSUM employs Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MrP) with structured priors to counteract the observable selection biases of social-media platforms. The protocol is validated during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, for which five PoSSUM polls were conducted and published on GitHub and X. In the final poll, fielded October 17-26 with a synthetic sample of 1,054 X users, PoSSUM accurately predicted the outcomes in 50 of 51 states and assigned the Republican candidate a win probability of 0.65. Notably, it also exhibited lower state-level bias than most established pollsters. These results demonstrate PoSSUM's potential as a fully automated, unobtrusive alternative to traditional survey methods.

### Cognitive Bias Detection Using Advanced Prompt Engineering
**Authors**: Frederic Lemieux, Aisha Behr, Clara Kellermann-Bryant, Zaki Mohammed

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:35:37Z

**Summary**: Cognitive biases, systematic deviations from rationality in judgment, pose significant challenges in generating objective content. This paper introduces a novel approach for real-time cognitive bias detection in user-generated text using large language models (LLMs) and advanced prompt engineering techniques. The proposed system analyzes textual data to identify common cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, circular reasoning, and hidden assumption. By designing tailored prompts, the system effectively leverages LLMs' capabilities to both recognize and mitigate these biases, improving the quality of human-generated content (e.g., news, media, reports). Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach in identifying cognitive biases, offering a valuable tool for enhancing content objectivity and reducing the risks of biased decision-making.

### Bootstrapping Language Models with DPO Implicit Rewards
**Authors**: Changyu Chen, Zichen Liu, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:26:03Z

**Summary**: Human alignment in large language models (LLMs) is an active area of research. A recent groundbreaking work, direct preference optimization (DPO), has greatly simplified the process from past work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by bypassing the reward learning stage in RLHF. DPO, after training, provides an implicit reward model. In this work, we make a novel observation that this implicit reward model can by itself be used in a bootstrapping fashion to further align the LLM. Our approach is to use the rewards from a current LLM to construct a preference dataset, which is then used in subsequent DPO rounds. We incorporate two refinements to further improve our approach: 1) length-regularized reward shaping to make the preference dataset length-unbiased; 2) experience replay to enhance the quality of the preference dataset. Our approach, named self-alignment with DPO ImpliCit rEwards (DICE), shows great improvements in alignment. It achieves an increase of more than 8$\\%$ in lengthcontrolled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 for all the different base models that we tried, without relying on external feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/dice.

### Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?
**Authors**: Qingyuan Liang, Zhao Zhang, Zeyu Sun, Zheng Lin, Qi Luo, Yueyi Xiao, Yizhou Chen, Yuqun Zhang, Haotian Zhang, Lu Zhang, Bin Chen, Yingfei Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:23:13Z

**Summary**: Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.

### Statistical Guarantees of Correctness Coverage for Medical   Multiple-Choice Question Answering
**Authors**: Yusong Ke

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:22:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world question-answering (QA) applications. However, LLMs have been proven to generate hallucinations and nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical tasks. Conformal prediction (CP) is well-known to be model-agnostic and distribution-free, which creates statistically rigorous prediction sets in classification tasks. In this work, we for the first time adapt the CP framework to medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks, by correlating the nonconformity score with the frequency score of correct options grounded in self-consistency theory, assuming no access to internal model information. Considering that the adapted CP framework can only control the (mis)coverage rate, we employ a risk control framework, which can manage task-specific metrics by devising a monotonically decreasing loss function. We evaluate our framework on 3 popular medical MCQA datasets utilizing 4 ``off-the-shelf'' LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that we achieve user-specified average (or marginal) error rates on the test set. Furthermore, we observe that the average prediction set size (APSS) on the test set decreases as the risk level increases, which concludes a promising evaluation metric for the uncertainty of LLMs.

### NLI under the Microscope: What Atomic Hypothesis Decomposition Reveals
**Authors**: Neha Srikanth, Rachel Rudinger

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:17:43Z

**Summary**: Decomposition of text into atomic propositions is a flexible framework allowing for the closer inspection of input and output text. We use atomic decomposition of hypotheses in two natural language reasoning tasks, traditional NLI and defeasible NLI, to form atomic sub-problems, or granular inferences that models must weigh when solving the overall problem. These atomic sub-problems serve as a tool to further understand the structure of both NLI and defeasible reasoning, probe a model's consistency and understanding of different inferences, and measure the diversity of examples in benchmark datasets. Our results indicate that LLMs still struggle with logical consistency on atomic NLI and defeasible NLI sub-problems. Lastly, we identify critical atomic sub-problems of defeasible NLI examples, or those that most contribute to the overall label, and propose a method to measure the inferential consistency of a model, a metric designed to capture the degree to which a model makes consistently correct or incorrect predictions about the same fact under different contexts.

### Under Pressure: Altimeter-Aided ICP for 3D Maps Consistency
**Authors**: William Dubois, Nicolas Samson, Effie Daum, Johann Laconte, FranÃ§ois Pomerleau

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:12:57Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel method to enhance the accuracy of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm by integrating altitude constraints from a barometric pressure sensor. While ICP is widely used in mobile robotics for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ( SLAM ), it is susceptible to drift, especially in underconstrained environments such as vertical shafts. To address this issue, we propose to augment ICP with altimeter measurements, reliably constraining drifts along the gravity vector. To demonstrate the potential of altimetry in SLAM , we offer an analysis of calibration procedures and noise sensitivity of various pressure sensors, improving measurements to centimeter-level accuracy. Leveraging this accuracy, we propose a novel ICP formulation that integrates altitude measurements along the gravity vector, thus simplifying the optimization problem to 3-Degree Of Freedom (DOF). Experimental results from real-world deployments demonstrate that our method reduces vertical drift by 84% and improves overall localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods in non-planar environments.

### Universality of Layer-Level Entropy-Weighted Quantization Beyond Model   Architecture and Size
**Authors**: Alireza Behtash, Marijan Fofonjka, Ethan Baird, Tyler Mauer, Hossein Moghimifam, David Stout, Joel Dennison

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:12:57Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends the limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.

### Umbilical Choir: Automated Live Testing for Edge-To-Cloud FaaS   Applications
**Authors**: Mohammadreza Malekabbasi, Tobias Pfandzelter, David Bermbach

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:05:56Z

**Summary**: Application users react negatively to performance regressions or availability issues across software releases. To address this, modern cloud-based applications with their multiple daily releases rely on live testing techniques such as A/B testing or canary releases. In edge-to-cloud applications, however, which have similar problems, developers currently still have to hard-code custom live testing tooling as there is no general framework for edge-to-cloud live testing.   With Umbilical Choir, we partially close this gap for serverless edge-to-cloud applications. Umbilical Choir is compatible with all Function-as-a-Service platforms and (extensively) supports various live testing techniques, including canary releases with various geo-aware strategies, A/B testing, and gradual roll-outs. We evaluate Umbilical Choir through a complex release scenario showcasing various live testing techniques in a mixed edge-cloud deployments and discuss different geo-aware strategies.

### Benchmarking LLMs in Recommendation Tasks: A Comparative Evaluation with   Conventional Recommenders
**Authors**: Qijiong Liu, Jieming Zhu, Lu Fan, Kun Wang, Hengchang Hu, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T15:05:23Z

**Summary**: In recent years, integrating large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems has created new opportunities for improving recommendation quality. However, a comprehensive benchmark is needed to thoroughly evaluate and compare the recommendation capabilities of LLMs with traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RecBench, which systematically investigates various item representation forms (including unique identifier, text, semantic embedding, and semantic identifier) and evaluates two primary recommendation tasks, i.e., click-through rate prediction (CTR) and sequential recommendation (SeqRec). Our extensive experiments cover up to 17 large models and are conducted across five diverse datasets from fashion, news, video, books, and music domains. Our findings indicate that LLM-based recommenders outperform conventional recommenders, achieving up to a 5% AUC improvement in the CTR scenario and up to a 170% NDCG@10 improvement in the SeqRec scenario. However, these substantial performance gains come at the expense of significantly reduced inference efficiency, rendering the LLM-as-RS paradigm impractical for real-time recommendation environments. We aim for our findings to inspire future research, including recommendation-specific model acceleration methods. We will release our code, data, configurations, and platform to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our experimental results.

### Maximum Hallucination Standards for Domain-Specific Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Tingmingke Lu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:51:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate yet credible-sounding content, known as hallucinations. This inherent feature of LLMs poses significant risks, especially in critical domains. I analyze LLMs as a new class of engineering products, treating hallucinations as a product attribute. I demonstrate that, in the presence of imperfect awareness of LLM hallucinations and misinformation externalities, net welfare improves when the maximum acceptable level of LLM hallucinations is designed to vary with two domain-specific factors: the willingness to pay for reduced LLM hallucinations and the marginal damage associated with misinformation.

### RiLoCo: An ISAC-oriented AI Solution to Build RIS-empowered Networks
**Authors**: Guillermo Encinas-Lago, Vincenzo Sciancalepore, Henk Wymeersch, Marco Di Renzo, Xavier Costa-Perez

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:51:08Z

**Summary**: The advance towards 6G networks comes with the promise of unprecedented performance in sensing and communication capabilities. The feat of achieving those, while satisfying the ever-growing demands placed on wireless networks, promises revolutionary advancements in sensing and communication technologies. As 6G aims to cater to the growing demands of wireless network users, the implementation of intelligent and efficient solutions becomes essential. In particular, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), also known as Smart Surfaces, are envisioned as a transformative technology for future 6G networks. The performance of RISs when used to augment existing devices is nevertheless largely affected by their precise location. Suboptimal deployments are also costly to correct, negating their low-cost benefits. This paper investigates the topic of optimal RISs diffusion, taking into account the improvement they provide both for the sensing and communication capabilities of the infrastructure while working with other antennas and sensors. We develop a combined metric that takes into account the properties and location of the individual devices to compute the performance of the entire infrastructure. We then use it as a foundation to build a reinforcement learning architecture that solves the RIS deployment problem. Since our metric measures the surface where given localization thresholds are achieved and the communication coverage of the area of interest, the novel framework we provide is able to seamlessly balance sensing and communication, showing its performance gain against reference solutions, where it achieves simultaneously almost the reference performance for communication and the reference performance for localization.

### A Bot-based Approach to Manage Codes of Conduct in Open-Source Projects
**Authors**: Sergio Cobos, Javier Luis CÃ¡novas Izquierdo

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:50:02Z

**Summary**: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) projects relies on the collaborative work of contributors, generally scattered around the world. To enable this collaboration, OSS projects are hosted on social-coding platforms like GitHub, which provide the infrastructure to host the code as well as the support for enabling the participation of the community. The potentially rich and diverse mixture of contributors in OSS projects makes their management not only a technical challenge, where automation tools and bots are usually deployed, but also a social one. To this aim, OSS projects have been increasingly deploying a declaration of their code of conduct, which defines rules to ensure a respectful and inclusive participatory environment in the community, being the Contributor Covenant the main model to follow. However, the broad adoption and enforcement of codes of conduct in OSS projects is still limited. In particular, the definition, deployment, and enforcement of codes of conduct is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach to effectively manage codes of conduct in OSS projects based on the Contributor Covenant proposal. Our solution has been implemented as a bot-based solution where bots help in the definition of codes of conduct, the monitoring of OSS projects, and the enforcement of ethical rules.

### MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Caching for LLM Web Services
**Authors**: Waris Gill, Mohamed Elidrisi, Pallavi Kalapatapu, Ammar Ahmed, Ali Anwar, Muhammad Ali Gulzar

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:49:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.

### Self-Learning for Personalized Keyword Spotting on Ultra-Low-Power Audio   Sensors
**Authors**: Manuele Rusci, Francesco Paci, Marco Fariselli, Eric Flamand, Tinne Tuytelaars

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:46:22Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a self-learning method to incrementally train (fine-tune) a personalized Keyword Spotting (KWS) model after the deployment on ultra-low power smart audio sensors. We address the fundamental problem of the absence of labeled training data by assigning pseudo-labels to the new recorded audio frames based on a similarity score with respect to few user recordings. By experimenting with multiple KWS models with a number of parameters up to 0.5M on two public datasets, we show an accuracy improvement of up to +19.2% and +16.0% vs. the initial models pretrained on a large set of generic keywords. The labeling task is demonstrated on a sensor system composed of a low-power microphone and an energy-efficient Microcontroller (MCU). By efficiently exploiting the heterogeneous processing engines of the MCU, the always-on labeling task runs in real-time with an average power cost of up to 8.2 mW. On the same platform, we estimate an energy cost for on-device training 10x lower than the labeling energy if sampling a new utterance every 6.1 s or 18.8 s with a DS-CNN-S or a DS-CNN-M model. Our empirical result paves the way to self-adaptive personalized KWS sensors at the extreme edge.

This task, evaluated on the DataBench dataset, assesses Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to answer natural language questions over structured data while addressing topic diversity and table size limitations in previous benchmarks. We propose a system that employs effective LLM prompting to translate natural language queries into executable code, enabling accurate responses, error correction, and interpretability. Our approach ranks first in both subtasks of the competition in the proprietary model category, significantly outperforming the organizer's baseline.

### GazeNoter: Co-Piloted AR Note-Taking via Gaze Selection of LLM   Suggestions to Match Users' Intentions
**Authors**: Hsin-Ruey Tsai, Shih-Kang Chiu, Bryan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:24:06Z

**Summary**: Note-taking is critical during speeches and discussions, serving not only for later summarization and organization but also for real-time question and opinion reminding in question-and-answer sessions or timely contributions in discussions. Manually typing on smartphones for note-taking could be distracting and increase cognitive load for users. While large language models (LLMs) are used to automatically generate summaries and highlights, the content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) may not match users' intentions without user input or interaction. Therefore, we propose an AI-copiloted augmented reality (AR) system, GazeNoter, to allow users to swiftly select diverse LLM-generated suggestions via gaze on an AR headset for real-time note-taking. GazeNoter leverages an AR headset as a medium for users to swiftly adjust the LLM output to match their intentions, forming a user-in-the-loop AI system for both within-context and beyond-context notes. We conducted two user studies to verify the usability of GazeNoter in attending speeches in a static sitting condition and walking meetings and discussions in a mobile walking condition, respectively.

**Authors**: Nenad Petrovic, Fengjunjie Pan, Vahid Zolfaghari, Alois Knoll

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:19:17Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to domain-specific metamodel construction relying on Large Language Model (LLM). The main focus is adoption in automotive domain. As outcome, a prototype was implemented as web service using Python programming language, while OpenAI's GPT-4o was used as the underlying LLM. Based on the initial experiments, this approach successfully constructs Ecore metamodel based on set of automotive requirements and visualizes it making use of PlantUML notation, so human experts can provide feedback in order to refine the result. Finally, locally deployable solution is also considered, including the limitations and additional steps required.

### LIFT: Improving Long Context Understanding of Large Language Models   through Long Input Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Yansheng Mao, Yufei Xu, Jiaqi Li, Fanxu Meng, Haotong Yang, Zilong Zheng, Xiyuan Wang, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:18:56Z

**Summary**: Long context understanding remains challenging for large language models due to their limited context windows. This paper presents Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT), a novel framework for long-context modeling that can improve the long-context performance of arbitrary (short-context) LLMs by dynamically adapting model parameters based on the long input. Importantly, LIFT, rather than endlessly extending the context window size to accommodate increasingly longer inputs in context, chooses to store and absorb the long input in parameter. By fine-tuning the long input into model parameters, LIFT allows short-context LLMs to answer questions even when the required information is not provided in the context during inference. Furthermore, to enhance LIFT performance while maintaining the original in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, we introduce Gated Memory, a specialized attention adapter that automatically balances long input memorization and ICL. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of LIFT on long context understanding, offering valuable directions for future research.

### Are Your LLM-based Text-to-SQL Models Secure? Exploring SQL Injection   via Backdoor Attacks
**Authors**: Meiyu Lin, Haichuan Zhang, Jiale Lao, Renyuan Li, Yuanchun Zhou, Carl Yang, Yang Cao, Mingjie Tang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:16:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.

### An Empirical Study of Conformal Prediction in LLM with ASP Scaffolds for   Robust Reasoning
**Authors**: Navdeep Kaur, Lachlan McPheat, Alessandra Russo, Anthony G Cohn, Pranava Madhyastha

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T14:10:10Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we examine the use of Conformal Language Modelling (CLM) alongside Answer Set Programming (ASP) to enhance the performance of standard open-weight LLMs on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Using the StepGame dataset, which requires spatial reasoning, we apply CLM to generate sets of ASP programs from an LLM, providing statistical guarantees on the correctness of the outputs. Experimental results show that CLM significantly outperforms baseline models that use standard sampling methods, achieving substantial accuracy improvements across different levels of reasoning complexity. Additionally, the LLM-as-Judge metric enhances CLM's performance, especially in assessing structurally and logically correct ASP outputs. However, calibrating CLM with diverse calibration sets did not improve generalizability for tasks requiring much longer reasoning steps, indicating limitations in handling more complex tasks.

### ECCOS: Efficient Capability and Cost Coordinated Scheduling for   Multi-LLM Serving
**Authors**: Kai Mei, Wujiang Xu, Shuhang Lin, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:35:33Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as service endpoints in systems, the surge in query volume creates significant scheduling challenges. Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset collected for sample-wise response quality and costs by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time. The code is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/ECCOS.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:20:12Z

**Summary**: Large Action Models (LAMs) have revolutionized intelligent automation, but their application in healthcare faces challenges due to privacy concerns, latency, and dependency on internet access. This report introduces an ondevice, multi-agent healthcare assistant that overcomes these limitations. The system utilizes smaller, task-specific agents to optimize resources, ensure scalability and high performance. Our proposed system acts as a one-stop solution for health care needs with features like appointment booking, health monitoring, medication reminders, and daily health reporting. Powered by the Qwen Code Instruct 2.5 7B model, the Planner and Caller Agents achieve an average RougeL score of 85.5 for planning and 96.5 for calling for our tasks while being lightweight for on-device deployment. This innovative approach combines the benefits of ondevice systems with multi-agent architectures, paving the way for user-centric healthcare solutions.

### Static Program Analysis Guided LLM Based Unit Test Generation
**Authors**: Sujoy Roychowdhury, Giriprasad Sridhara, A K Raghavan, Joy Bose, Sourav Mazumdar, Hamender Singh, Srinivasan Bajji Sugumaran, Ricardo Britto

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:09:37Z

**Summary**: We describe a novel approach to automating unit test generation for Java methods using large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based approaches rely on sample usage(s) of the method to test (focal method) and/or provide the entire class of the focal method as input prompt and context. The former approach is often not viable due to the lack of sample usages, especially for newly written focal methods. The latter approach does not scale well enough; the bigger the complexity of the focal method and larger associated class, the harder it is to produce adequate test code (due to factors such as exceeding the prompt and context lengths of the underlying LLM). We show that augmenting prompts with \emph{concise} and \emph{precise} context information obtained by program analysis %of the focal method increases the effectiveness of generating unit test code through LLMs. We validate our approach on a large commercial Java project and a popular open-source Java project.

### Ontology Generation using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anna Sofia Lippolis, Mohammad Javad Saeedizade, Robin KeskisÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Sara Zuppiroli, Miguel Ceriani, Aldo Gangemi, Eva Blomqvist, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T13:03:28Z

**Summary**: The ontology engineering process is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone, even for experienced ontology engineers. In this work, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide effective OWL ontology drafts directly from ontological requirements described using user stories and competency questions. Our main contribution is the presentation and evaluation of two new prompting techniques for automated ontology development: Memoryless CQbyCQ and Ontogenia. We also emphasize the importance of three structural criteria for ontology assessment, alongside expert qualitative evaluation, highlighting the need for a multi-dimensional evaluation in order to capture the quality and usability of the generated ontologies. Our experiments, conducted on a benchmark dataset of ten ontologies with 100 distinct CQs and 29 different user stories, compare the performance of three LLMs using the two prompting techniques. The results demonstrate improvements over the current state-of-the-art in LLM-supported ontology engineering. More specifically, the model OpenAI o1-preview with Ontogenia produces ontologies of sufficient quality to meet the requirements of ontology engineers, significantly outperforming novice ontology engineers in modelling ability. However, we still note some common mistakes and variability of result quality, which is important to take into account when using LLMs for ontology authoring support. We discuss these limitations and propose directions for future research.

### Hints-In-Browser: Benchmarking Language Models for Programming Feedback   Generation
**Authors**: Nachiket Kotalwar, Alkis Gotovos, Adish Singla

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:46:14Z

**Summary**: Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.

### Femur: A Flexible Framework for Fast and Secure Querying from Public   Key-Value Store
**Authors**: Jiaoyi Zhang, Liqiang Peng, Mo Sha, Weiran Liu, Xiang Li, Sheng Wang, Feifei Li, Mingyu Gao, Huanchen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:39:07Z

**Summary**: With increasing demands for privacy, it becomes necessary to protect sensitive user query data when accessing public key-value databases. Existing Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes provide full security but suffer from poor scalability, limiting their applicability in large-scale deployment. We argue that in many real-world scenarios, a more practical solution should allow users to flexibly determine the privacy levels of their queries in a theoretically guided way, balancing security and performance based on specific needs. To formally provide provable guarantees, we introduce a novel concept of distance-based indistinguishability, which can facilitate users to comfortably relax their security requirements. We then design Femur, an efficient framework to securely query public key-value stores with flexible security and performance trade-offs. It uses a space-efficient learned index to convert query keys into storage locations, obfuscates these locations with extra noise provably derived by the distance-based indistinguishability theory, and sends the expanded range to the server. The server then adaptively utilizes the best scheme to retrieve data. We also propose a novel variable-range PIR scheme optimized for bandwidth-constrained environments. Experiments show that Femur outperforms the state-of-the-art designs even when ensuring the same full security level. When users are willing to relax their privacy requirements, Femur can further improve the performance gains to up to 163.9X, demonstrating an effective trade-off between security and performance.

### Shifting Perspectives: Steering Vector Ensembles for Robust Bias   Mitigation in LLMs
**Authors**: Zara Siddique, Irtaza Khalid, Liam D. Turner, Luis Espinosa-Anke

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:25:29Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We employ Bayesian optimization to systematically identify effective contrastive pair datasets across nine bias axes. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.2%, 4.7%, and 3.2% over the baseline for Mistral, Llama, and Qwen, respectively. Building on these promising results, we introduce Steering Vector Ensembles (SVE), a method that averages multiple individually optimized steering vectors, each targeting a specific bias axis such as age, race, or gender. By leveraging their collective strength, SVE outperforms individual steering vectors in both bias reduction and maintaining model performance. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that SVE is a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.

### Chain of Strategy Optimization Makes Large Language Models Better   Emotional Supporter
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhao, Xingyu Sui, Xinyang Han, Yang Deng, Yulin Hu, Jiahe Guo, Libo Qin, Qianyun Du, Shijin Wang, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T12:07:59Z

**Summary**: The growing emotional stress in modern society has increased the demand for Emotional Support Conversations (ESC). While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for ESC, they face two key challenges: (1) low strategy selection accuracy, and (2) preference bias, limiting their adaptability to emotional needs of users. Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles to address these issues, as it rigidly trains models on single gold-standard responses without modeling nuanced strategy trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Strategy Optimization (CSO), a novel approach that optimizes strategy selection preferences at each dialogue turn. We first leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct ESC-Pro, a high-quality preference dataset with turn-level strategy-response pairs. Training on ESC-Pro with CSO improves both strategy accuracy and bias mitigation, enabling LLMs to generate more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9B, and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that CSO outperforms standard SFT, highlighting the efficacy of fine-grained, turn-level preference modeling in ESC.

### GEMA-Score: Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score for Radiology Report   Evaluation
**Authors**: Zhenxuan Zhang, Kinhei Lee, Weihang Deng, Huichi Zhou, Zihao Jin, Jiahao Huang, Zhifan Gao, Dominic C Marshall, Yingying Fang, Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:42:22Z

**Summary**: Automatic medical report generation supports clinical diagnosis, reduces the workload of radiologists, and holds the promise of improving diagnosis consistency. However, existing evaluation metrics primarily assess the accuracy of key medical information coverage in generated reports compared to human-written reports, while overlooking crucial details such as the location and certainty of reported abnormalities. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs NER-F1 calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = 0.70 for Rexval dataset and Kendall coefficient = 0.54 for RadEvalX dataset). The anonymous project demo is available at: https://github.com/Zhenxuan-Zhang/GEMA_score.

### Speculative MoE: Communication Efficient Parallel MoE Inference with   Speculative Token and Expert Pre-scheduling
**Authors**: Yan Li, Pengfei Zheng, Shuang Chen, Zewei Xu, Yuanhao Lai, Yunfei Du, Zhengang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:41:53Z

**Summary**: MoE (Mixture of Experts) prevails as a neural architecture that can scale modern transformer-based LLMs (Large Language Models) to unprecedented scales. Nevertheless, large MoEs' great demands of computing power, memory capacity and memory bandwidth make scalable serving a fundamental challenge and efficient parallel inference has become a requisite to attain adequate throughput under latency constraints. DeepSpeed-MoE, one state-of-the-art MoE inference framework, adopts a 3D-parallel paradigm including EP (Expert Parallelism), TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallelism). However, our analysis shows DeepSpeed-MoE's inference efficiency is largely bottlenecked by EP, which is implemented with costly all-to-all collectives to route token activation. Our work aims to boost DeepSpeed-MoE by strategically reducing EP's communication overhead with a technique named Speculative MoE. Speculative MoE has two speculative parallelization schemes, speculative token shuffling and speculative expert grouping, which predict outstanding tokens' expert routing paths and pre-schedule tokens and experts across devices to losslessly trim EP's communication volume. Besides DeepSpeed-MoE, we also build Speculative MoE into a prevailing MoE inference engine SGLang. Experiments show Speculative MoE can significantly boost state-of-the-art MoE inference frameworks on fast homogeneous and slow heterogeneous interconnects.

### AutoIOT: LLM-Driven Automated Natural Language Programming for AIoT   Applications
**Authors**: Leming Shen, Qiang Yang, Yuanqing Zheng, Mo Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:40:52Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed our lives, revolutionizing interactions with AI and lowering the barrier to AI usage. While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the extensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data. This capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this evolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application development, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design and development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some limitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT application development. First, existing solutions often require transferring raw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high query fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of LLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and correctness of inference results. This paper introduces AutoIOT, an LLM-based automated program generator for AIoT applications. AutoIOT enables users to specify their requirements using natural language (input) and automatically synthesizes interpretable programs with documentation (output). AutoIOT automates the iterative optimization to enhance the quality of generated code with minimum user involvement. AutoIOT not only makes the execution of AIoT tasks more explainable but also mitigates privacy concerns and reduces token costs with local execution of synthesized programs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate AutoIOT's remarkable capability in program synthesis for various AIoT tasks. The synthesized programs can match and even outperform some representative baselines.

### LLM-as-BT-Planner: Leveraging LLMs for Behavior Tree Generation in Robot   Task Planning
**Authors**: Jicong Ao, Fan Wu, Yansong Wu, Abdalla Swikir, Sami Haddadin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:32:55Z

**Summary**: Robotic assembly tasks remain an open challenge due to their long horizon nature and complex part relations. Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:23:48Z

**Summary**: There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the performance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment contexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly used static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits rarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for generative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system safety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable insights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields, including transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In particular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable to real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation institutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline a concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI systems.

### EdgeMoE: Empowering Sparse Large Language Models on Mobile Devices
**Authors**: Rongjie Yi, Liwei Guo, Shiyun Wei, Ao Zhou, Shangguang Wang, Mengwei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:16:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs and Mixtral-8x7B have revolutionized machine intelligence due to their exceptional abilities in generic ML tasks. Transiting LLMs from datacenters to edge devices brings benefits like better privacy and availability, but is challenged by their massive parameter size and thus unbearable runtime costs. To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs -- a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline. On popular MoE LLMs and edge devices, EdgeMoE showcase significant memory savings and speedup over competitive baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/mllm.

### Dynamic Knowledge Integration for Evidence-Driven Counter-Argument   Generation with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:13:33Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the role of dynamic external knowledge integration in improving counter-argument generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate lengthy, potentially unfactual responses highlights the need for more controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a new manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and reliable counter-argumentation systems.

**Authors**: Siwei Wu, Yizhi Li, Xingwei Qu, Rishi Ravikumar, Yucheng Li, Tyler Loakman, Shanghaoran Quan, Xiaoyong Wei, Riza Batista-Navarro, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:05:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to generate long-form content remains poorly understood and evaluated. Our analysis reveals that current LLMs struggle with length requirements and information density in long-text generation, with performance deteriorating as text length increases. To quantitively locate such a performance degradation and provide further insights on model development, we present LongEval, a benchmark that evaluates long-text generation through both direct and plan-based generation paradigms, inspired by cognitive and linguistic writing models. The comprehensive experiments in this work reveal interesting findings such as that while model size correlates with generation ability, the small-scale model (e.g., LongWriter), well-trained on long texts, has comparable performance. All code and datasets are released in https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/LongEval.

### Routing for Large ML Models
**Authors**: Ofir Cohen, Jose Yallouz Michael Schapira, Shahar Belkar, Tal Mizrahi

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T11:02:17Z

**Summary**: Training large language models (LLMs), and other large machine learning models, involves repeated communication of large volumes of data across a data center network. The communication patterns induced by these training process exhibit high regularity and persistence, giving rise to significant opportunities for optimizing the manner in which flows are routed across the network. We present an algorithmic framework for \textit{quantifying} network-wide efficiency in the context of training LLMs (and other large-scale ML models), and for periodically \textit{optimizing} routing with respect to this global metric.

**Authors**: Yu Zhao, Huxian Liu, Xiang Chen, Jiankai Sun, Jiahuan Yan, Luhui Hu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:50:58Z

**Summary**: Physical intelligence holds immense promise for advancing embodied intelligence, enabling robots to acquire complex behaviors from demonstrations. However, achieving generalization and transfer across diverse robotic platforms and environments requires careful design of model architectures, training strategies, and data diversity. Meanwhile existing systems often struggle with scalability, adaptability to heterogeneous hardware, and objective evaluation in real-world settings. We present a generalized end-to-end robotic learning framework designed to bridge this gap. Our framework introduces a unified architecture that supports cross-platform adaptability, enabling seamless deployment across industrial-grade robots, collaborative arms, and novel embodiments without task-specific modifications. By integrating multi-task learning with streamlined network designs, it achieves more robust performance than conventional approaches, while maintaining compatibility with varying sensor configurations and action spaces. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on seven manipulation tasks. Notably, Diffusion-based models trained in our framework demonstrated superior performance and generalizability compared to the LeRobot framework, achieving performance improvements across diverse robotic platforms and environmental conditions.

### Are AI Detectors Good Enough? A Survey on Quality of Datasets With   Machine-Generated Texts
**Authors**: German Gritsai, Anastasia Voznyuk, Andrey Grabovoy, Yury Chekhovich

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:17:34Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the quality of generated texts, necessitating reliable machine-generated text detectors. A huge number of detectors and collections with AI fragments have emerged, and several detection methods even showed recognition quality up to 99.9% according to the target metrics in such collections. However, the quality of such detectors tends to drop dramatically in the wild, posing a question: Are detectors actually highly trustworthy or do their high benchmark scores come from the poor quality of evaluation datasets? In this paper, we emphasise the need for robust and qualitative methods for evaluating generated data to be secure against bias and low generalising ability of future model. We present a systematic review of datasets from competitions dedicated to AI-generated content detection and propose methods for evaluating the quality of datasets containing AI-generated fragments. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data to achieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving the training datasets themselves. Our contribution aims to facilitate a better understanding of the dynamics between human and machine text, which will ultimately support the integrity of information in an increasingly automated world.

### Towards Autonomous Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic   Manipulation with Large Language Models
**Authors**: NiccolÃ² Turcato, Matteo Iovino, Aris Synodinos, Alberto Dalla Libera, Ruggero Carli, Pietro Falco

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T10:06:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.

### Similarity-Based Domain Adaptation with LLMs
**Authors**: Jie He, Wendi Zhou, Xiang Lorraine Li, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:51:07Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation leverages abundant labeled data from various source domains to generalize onto unlabeled target data. Prior research has primarily focused on learning domain-invariant features across the source and target domains. However, these methods often require training a model using source domain data, which is time-consuming and can limit model usage for applications with different source data. This paper introduces a simple framework that utilizes the impressive generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for target data annotation without the need of source model training, followed by a novel similarity-based knowledge distillation loss. Our extensive experiments on cross-domain text classification reveal that our framework achieves impressive performance, specifically, 2.44\% accuracy improvement when compared to the SOTA method.

**Authors**: Yushan Liu, Shilong Mu, Xintao Chao, Zizhen Li, Yao Mu, Tianxing Chen, Shoujie Li, Chuqiao Lyu, Xiao-ping Zhang, Wenbo Ding

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:50:58Z

**Summary**: Robotic manipulation within dynamic environments presents challenges to precise control and adaptability. Traditional fixed-view camera systems face challenges adapting to change viewpoints and scale variations, limiting perception and manipulation precision. To tackle these issues, we propose the Active Vision-driven Robotic (AVR) framework, a teleoperation hardware solution that supports dynamic viewpoint and dynamic focal length adjustments to continuously center targets and maintain optimal scale, accompanied by a corresponding algorithm that effectively enhances the success rates of various operational tasks. Using the RoboTwin platform with a real-time image processing plugin, AVR framework improves task success rates by 5%-16% on five manipulation tasks. Physical deployment on a dual-arm system demonstrates in collaborative tasks and 36% precision in screwdriver insertion, outperforming baselines by over 25%. Experimental results confirm that AVR framework enhances environmental perception, manipulation repeatability (40% $\le $1 cm error), and robustness in complex scenarios, paving the way for future robotic precision manipulation methods in the pursuit of human-level robot dexterity and precision.

**Authors**: Neemesh Yadav, Jiarui Liu, Francesco Ortu, Roya Ensafi, Zhijing Jin, Rada Mihalcea

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:49:31Z

**Summary**: The ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to categorize text into multiple classes has motivated their use in online content moderation tasks, such as hate speech and fake news detection. However, there is limited understanding of how or why these methods make such decisions, or why certain content is moderated in the first place. To investigate the hidden mechanisms behind content moderation, we explore multiple directions: 1) training classifiers to reverse-engineer content moderation decisions across countries; 2) explaining content moderation decisions by analyzing Shapley values and LLM-guided explanations. Our primary focus is on content moderation decisions made across countries, using pre-existing corpora sampled from the Twitter Stream Grab. Our experiments reveal interesting patterns in censored posts, both across countries and over time. Through human evaluations of LLM-generated explanations across three LLMs, we assess the effectiveness of using LLMs in content moderation. Finally, we discuss potential future directions, as well as the limitations and ethical considerations of this work. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/causalNLP/censorship

### Ticktack : Long Span Temporal Alignment of Large Language Models   Leveraging Sexagenary Cycle Time Expression
**Authors**: Xue Han, Qian Hu, Yitong Wang, Wenchun Gao, Lianlian Zhang, Qing Wang, Lijun Mei, Chao Deng, Junlan Feng

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:37:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

### ZOGRASCOPE: A New Benchmark for Property Graphs
**Authors**: Francesco Cazzaro, Justin Kleindienst, Sofia Marquez, Ariadna Quattoni

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:33:30Z

**Summary**: Natural language interfaces to knowledge graphs have become increasingly important in recent years, enabling easy and efficient access to structured data. In particular property graphs have seen growing adoption. However, these kind of graphs remain relatively underrepresented in research, which has focused in large part on RDF-style graphs. As a matter of fact there is a lack of resources for evaluating systems on property graphs, with many existing datasets featuring relatively simple queries. To address this gap, we introduce ZOGRASCOPE, a benchmark designed specifically for the cypher query language. The benchmark includes a diverse set of manually annotated queries of varying complexity. We complement this paper with a set of experiments that test the performance of out-of-the-box LLMs of different sizes. Our experiments show that semantic parsing over graphs is still a challenging open problem that can not be solved by prompting LLMs alone.

### LINGOLY-TOO: Disentangling Memorisation from Reasoning with Linguistic   Templatisation and Orthographic Obfuscation
**Authors**: Jude Khouja, Karolina Korgul, Simi Hellsten, Lingyi Yang, Vlad Neacsu, Harry Mayne, Ryan Kearns, Andrew Bean, Adam Mahdi

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:31:42Z

**Summary**: Assessing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is susceptible to overestimation due to data exposure of evaluation benchmarks. We introduce a framework for producing linguistic reasoning problems that reduces the effect of memorisation in model performance estimates and apply this framework to develop LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging benchmark for linguistic reasoning. By developing orthographic templates, we dynamically obfuscate the writing systems of real languages to generate numerousquestion variations. These variations preserve the reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood of specific problem instances appearing in model training data. Our experiments demonstrate that frontier models, including Claud 3.7 Sonnet, o1-preview and DeepSeek R1, struggle with advanced reasoning. Our analysis also shows that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance in accuracy across permutations of the same problem, and on average perform better on questions appearing in their original orthography. Our findings highlight the opaque nature of response generation in LLMs and provide evidence that prior data exposure contributes to over estimating the reasoning capabilities of frontier models.

### Large Language Models are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition   Learners
**Authors**: Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Honglie Chen, Pingchuan Ma, Stavros Petridis, Daniele Falavigna, Alessio Brutti, Maja Pantic

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:30:16Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.79% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.

### DetectRL: Benchmarking LLM-Generated Text Detection in Real-World   Scenarios
**Authors**: Junchao Wu, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F. Wong, Shu Yang, Xinyi Yang, Yulin Yuan, Lidia S. Chao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:06:03Z

**Summary**: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is of great recent interest. With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors.

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive-scale corpora, the issue of data contamination has become increasingly severe, leading to potential overestimation of model performance during evaluation. To address this, we propose AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation), a dynamic data evaluation method aimed at mitigating the impact of data contamination on evaluation reliability. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that AdEval effectively reduces the impact of data contamination on evaluation outcomes, enhancing both the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process.

### Optimizing LLM Inference Throughput via Memory-aware and SLA-constrained   Dynamic Batching
**Authors**: Bowen Pang, Kai Li, Feifan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:02:21Z

**Summary**: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) necessitates inference serving systems that can deliver both high throughput and low latency. Deploying LLMs with hundreds of billions of parameters on memory-constrained GPUs exposes significant limitations in static batching methods. Current inference serving systems often treat batch sizes as fixed hyper-parameters, hindering real-time adaptation to varying system conditions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic batching method that continuously monitors memory utilization and adheres to service-level agreements (SLAs) to enable real-time batch size configuration adjustment. The method comprises two core components: a memory-aware batch scheduler that dynamically allocates GPU resources and a latency feedback mechanism that optimizes decoding processes under SLA constraints. The numerical experiments demonstrate throughput gains of 8% to 28% and capacity improvements of 22% compared to traditional static batching methods, while maintaining full compatibility with existing inference infrastructure. These results highlight the effectiveness of dynamic batching in balancing computational efficiency and quality-of-service requirements for contemporary LLM deployment scenarios.

### VidHal: Benchmarking Temporal Hallucinations in Vision LLMs
**Authors**: Wey Yeh Choong, Yangyang Guo, Mohan Kankanhalli

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T09:00:43Z

**Summary**: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are widely acknowledged to be prone to hallucinations. Existing research addressing this problem has primarily been confined to image inputs, with limited exploration of video-based hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods fail to capture nuanced errors in generated responses, which are often exacerbated by the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of videos. To address this, we introduce VidHal, a benchmark specially designed to evaluate video-based hallucinations in VLLMs. VidHal is constructed by bootstrapping video instances across a wide range of common temporal aspects. A defining feature of our benchmark lies in the careful creation of captions which represent varying levels of hallucination associated with each video. To enable fine-grained evaluation, we propose a novel caption ordering task requiring VLLMs to rank captions by hallucinatory extent. We conduct extensive experiments on VidHal and comprehensively evaluate a broad selection of models. Our results uncover significant limitations in existing VLLMs regarding hallucination generation. Through our benchmark, we aim to inspire further research on 1) holistic understanding of VLLM capabilities, particularly regarding hallucination, and 2) extensive development of advanced VLLMs to alleviate this problem.

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:56:20Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.

### MM-StoryAgent: Immersive Narrated Storybook Video Generation with a   Multi-Agent Paradigm across Text, Image and Audio
**Authors**: Xuenan Xu, Jiahao Mei, Chenliang Li, Yuning Wu, Ming Yan, Shaopeng Lai, Ji Zhang, Mengyue Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:53:10Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has accelerated AI-native applications, such as AI-based storybooks that automate engaging story production for children. However, challenges remain in improving story attractiveness, enriching storytelling expressiveness, and developing open-source evaluation benchmarks and frameworks. Therefore, we propose and opensource MM-StoryAgent, which creates immersive narrated video storybooks with refined plots, role-consistent images, and multi-channel audio. MM-StoryAgent designs a multi-agent framework that employs LLMs and diverse expert tools (generative models and APIs) across several modalities to produce expressive storytelling videos. The framework enhances story attractiveness through a multi-stage writing pipeline. In addition, it improves the immersive storytelling experience by integrating sound effects with visual, music and narrative assets. MM-StoryAgent offers a flexible, open-source platform for further development, where generative modules can be substituted. Both objective and subjective evaluation regarding textual story quality and alignment between modalities validate the effectiveness of our proposed MM-StoryAgent system. The demo and source code are available.

### Guaranteeing Out-Of-Distribution Detection in Deep RL via Transition   Estimation
**Authors**: Mohit Prashant, Arvind Easwaran, Suman Das, Michael Yuhas

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:40:41Z

**Summary**: An issue concerning the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents is whether they can be trusted to perform reliably when deployed, as training environments may not reflect real-life environments. Anticipating instances outside their training scope, learning-enabled systems are often equipped with out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors that alert when a trained system encounters a state it does not recognize or in which it exhibits uncertainty. There exists limited work conducted on the problem of OOD detection within RL, with prior studies being unable to achieve a consensus on the definition of OOD execution within the context of RL. By framing our problem using a Markov Decision Process, we assume there is a transition distribution mapping each state-action pair to another state with some probability. Based on this, we consider the following definition of OOD execution within RL: A transition is OOD if its probability during real-life deployment differs from the transition distribution encountered during training. As such, we utilize conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) to approximate the transition dynamics of the training environment and implement a conformity-based detector using reconstruction loss that is able to guarantee OOD detection with a pre-determined confidence level. We evaluate our detector by adapting existing benchmarks and compare it with existing OOD detection models for RL.

### ARIES: Stimulating Self-Refinement of Large Language Models by Iterative   Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Yongcheng Zeng, Xinyu Cui, Xuanfa Jin, Guoqing Liu, Zexu Sun, Quan He, Dong Li, Ning Yang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:35:00Z

**Summary**: A truly intelligent Large Language Model (LLM) should be capable of correcting errors in its responses through external interactions. However, even the most advanced models often face challenges in improving their outputs. In this paper, we explore how to cultivate LLMs with the self-refinement capability through iterative preference training, and how this ability can be leveraged to improve model performance during inference. To this end, we introduce a novel post-training and inference framework, called ARIES: Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Enhancement Structure. This method iteratively performs preference training and self-refinement-based data collection. During training, ARIES strengthen the model's direct question-answering capability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement potential. During inference, ARIES harnesses this self-refinement capability to generate a series of progressively refined responses, which are then filtered using either the Reward Model Scoring or a simple yet effective Rule-Based Selection mechanism, specifically tailored to our approach, to construct a dataset for the next round of preference training. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of ARIES. When applied to the Llama-3.1-8B model and under the self-refinement setting, ARIES surpasses powerful models such as GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled (LC) and a 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, outperforming Iterative DPO by 27.8% and 35.5% respectively, as well as a 50.3% win rate on Arena-Hard, surpassing Iterative DPO by 26.6%. Furthermore, ARIES consistently enhances performance on mathematical reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH.

### Unveiling Biases in AI: ChatGPT's Political Economy Perspectives and   Human Comparisons
**Authors**: Leonardo Becchetti, Nazaria Solferino

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:33:34Z

**Summary**: We explore the political and ideological positioning of ChatGPT, a leading large language model (LLM), by comparing its responses to political economy questions from the European Social Survey (ESS). The questions concern environmental sustainability, civil rights, income inequality, and government size. ChatGPT's self-assessed placement on a left-right political spectrum is compared to the ideological stances of individuals providing similar answers in the ESS dataset. Results highlight a significant left-oriented bias in ChatGPT's answers, particularly on environmental and civil rights topics, diverging from its same self-declared center-left stance. These findings underscore the need for transparency in AI systems to prevent potential ideological influences on users. We conclude by discussing the implications for AI governance, debiasing strategies, and educational use.

### HBTP: Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning with Large Language Model   Reasoning
**Authors**: Yishuai Cai, Xinglin Chen, Yunxin Mao, Minglong Li, Shaowu Yang, Wenjing Yang, Ji Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:27:32Z

**Summary**: Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)-a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.

Shapiro, Matthieu Sylvander, Benjamin Vial, David Wolyniec

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:19:51Z

**Summary**: In the framework of the MACIV project, a consortium of French laboratories has deployed a temporary seismic network of 100 broadband stations in the French Massif Central (FMC) for 3-4 years (2023-2027). The project aims at imaging the crust and upper mantle of the FMC to better assess the sources of volcanism, and the impacts of the Variscan inheritance or the Cenozoic rift system on volcanic systems. A large-scale array of 35 broadband stations covers the entire FMC and complements the permanent networks to reach a homogeneous coverage with ~35 km spacing. This network, with XP code, is the French contribution to AdriaArray. The XP array is complemented with 3 quasi-linear north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast profiles with inter-station spacing of 5-20 km, making up the XF network of 65 stations. The profiles cross volcanic areas and the main Variscan structures. We describe the experimental setup designed to optimize the performance/cost ratio and minimize the number of field visits, the deployment, the state-of-health monitoring, the data management and the data quality control strategies, outcomes of our 15-years' experience with major temporary seismic experiments in France and neighboring countries, including AlpArray. We also show some preliminary results including hypocenter locations and receiver function analysis. The 2 broadband arrays will be supplemented in 2025 by a month-long deployment of 3 large-N dense arrays of 625 3-C short-period nodes. These dense arrays will complete our multi-scale seismic experiment and illuminate active faults and possible plumbing systems of the youngest volcanoes.

### DIMSUM: Discourse in Mathematical Reasoning as a Supervision Module
**Authors**: Krish Sharma, Niyar R Barman, Akshay Chaturvedi, Nicholas Asher

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:19:07Z

**Summary**: We look at reasoning on GSM8k, a dataset of short texts presenting primary school, math problems. We find, with Mirzadeh et al. (2024), that current LLM progress on the data set may not be explained by better reasoning but by exposure to a broader pretraining data distribution. We then introduce a novel information source for helping models with less data or inferior training reason better: discourse structure. We show that discourse structure improves performance for models like Llama2 13b by up to 160%. Even for models that have most likely memorized the data set, adding discourse structural information to the model still improves predictions and dramatically improves large model performance on out of distribution examples.

### ARbiter: Generating Dialogue Options and Communication Support in   Augmented Reality
**Authors**: JuliÃ¡n MÃ©ndez, Marc Satkowski

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:16:30Z

**Summary**: In this position paper, we propose researching the combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support conversations, inspired by the interfaces of dialogue systems commonly found in videogames. AR-capable devices are becoming more powerful and conventional in looks, as seen in head-mounted displays (HMDs) like the Snapchat Spectacles, the XREAL glasses, or the recently presented Meta Orion. This development reduces possible ergonomic, appearance, and runtime concerns, thus allowing a more straightforward integration and extended use of AR in our everyday lives, both in private and at work. At the same time, we can observe an immense surge in AI development (also at CHI). Recently notorious Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's o3-mini or DeepSeek-R1 soar over their precursors in their ability to sustain conversations, provide suggestions, and handle complex topics in (almost) real time. In combination with natural language recognition systems, which are nowadays a standard component of smartphones and similar devices (including modern AR-HMDs), it is easy to imagine a combined system that integrates into daily conversations and provides various types of assistance. Such a system would enable many opportunities for research in AR+AI, which, as stated by Hirzle et al., remains scarce. In the following, we describe how the design of a conversational AR+AI system can learn from videogame dialogue systems, and we propose use cases and research questions that can be investigated thanks to this AR+AI combination.

### CLIP meets DINO for Tuning Zero-Shot Classifier using Unlabeled Image   Collections
**Authors**: Mohamed Fazli Imam, Rufael Fedaku Marew, Jameel Hassan, Mustansar Fiaz, Alham Fikri Aji, Hisham Cholakkal

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:08:18Z

**Summary**: In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text & visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Our code & models can be found at https://github.com/fazliimam/NoLA.

### Personalized Text Generation with Contrastive Activation Steering
**Authors**: Jinghao Zhang, Yuting Liu, Wenjie Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:07:15Z

**Summary**: Personalized text generation aims to infer users' writing style preferences from their historical texts and generate outputs that faithfully reflect these stylistic characteristics. Existing solutions primarily adopt two paradigms: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While these approaches have advanced the field, they suffer from two critical limitations: (1) the entanglement of content semantics and stylistic patterns in historical texts impedes accurate modeling of user-specific writing preferences; and (2) scalability challenges arising from both RAG's inference latency by retrieval operations and PEFT's parameter storage requirements for per user model. To overcome these limitations, we propose StyleVector, a training-free framework that disentangles and represents personalized writing style as a vector in LLM's activation space, enabling style-steered generation during inference without requiring costly retrieval or parameter storage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a significant 8% relative improvement in personalized generation while reducing storage requirements by 1700 times over PEFT method.

### Human Implicit Preference-Based Policy Fine-tuning for Multi-Agent   Reinforcement Learning in USV Swarm
**Authors**: Hyeonjun Kim, Kanghoon Lee, Junho Park, Jiachen Li, Jinkyoo Park

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:06:15Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.

### GreenDFL: a Framework for Assessing the Sustainability of Decentralized   Federated Learning Systems
**Authors**: Chao Feng, Alberto Huertas CeldrÃ¡n, Xi Cheng, GÃ©rÃ´me Bovet, Burkhard Stiller

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:04:54Z

**Summary**: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborative model training without centralized data and model aggregation, enhancing privacy and resilience. However, its sustainability remains underexplored, as energy consumption and carbon emissions vary across different system configurations. Understanding the environmental impact of DFL is crucial for optimizing its design and deployment. This work aims to develop a comprehensive and operational framework for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. To address it, this work provides a systematic method for quantifying energy consumption and carbon emissions, offering insights into improving the sustainability of DFL. This work proposes GreenDFL, a fully implementable framework that has been integrated into a real-world DFL platform. GreenDFL systematically analyzes the impact of various factors, including hardware accelerators, model architecture, communication medium, data distribution, network topology, and federation size, on the sustainability of DFL systems. Besides, a sustainability-aware aggregation algorithm (GreenDFL-SA) and a node selection algorithm (GreenDFL-SN) are developed to optimize energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in DFL training. Empirical experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions at different phases of the DFL lifecycle. The proposed GreenDFL provides a comprehensive and practical approach for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. Furthermore, it offers best practices for improving environmental efficiency in DFL, making sustainability considerations more actionable in real-world deployments.

### Knowledge Updating? No More Model Editing! Just Selective Contextual   Reasoning
**Authors**: Guoxiu He, Xin Song, Aixin Sun

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T08:04:25Z

**Summary**: As real-world knowledge evolves, the information embedded within large language models (LLMs) can become outdated, inadequate, or erroneous. Model editing has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with minimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically identifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired knowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects that parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More critically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and continuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these shortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that all ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across multiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then propose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR), for knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses LLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated knowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query falls within the scope of an external knowledge base. If it does, the relevant external knowledge texts are contextualized to enhance reasoning; otherwise, the query is answered directly. We evaluate SCR against the ten model editing methods on two counterfactual datasets with three backbone LLMs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of contextual reasoning for knowledge updating.

### Operationalizing Cybersecurity Knowledge: Design, Implementation &   Evaluation of a Knowledge Management System for CACAO Playbooks
**Authors**: Orestis Tsirakis, Konstantinos Fysarakis, Vasileios Mavroeidis, Ioannis Papaefstathiou

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:54:43Z

**Summary**: Modern cybersecurity threats are growing in complexity, targeting increasingly intricate & interconnected systems. To effectively defend against these evolving threats, security teams utilize automation & orchestration to enhance response efficiency and consistency. In that sense, cybersecurity playbooks are key enablers, providing a structured, reusable, and continuously improving approach to incident response, enabling organizations to codify requirements, domain expertise, and best practices and automate decision-making processes to the extent possible. The emerging Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) standard defines a common machine-processable schema for cybersecurity playbooks, facilitating interoperability for their exchange and ensuring the ability to orchestrate and automate cybersecurity operations. However, despite its potential and the fact that it is a relatively new standardization work, there is a lack of tools to support its adoption and, in particular, the management & lifecycle development of CACAO playbooks, limiting their practical deployment. Motivated by the above, this work presents the design, development, and evaluation of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) for managing CACAO cybersecurity playbooks throughout their lifecycle, providing essential tools to streamline playbook management. Using open technologies & standards, the proposed approach fosters standards-based interoperability & enhances the usability of state-of-the-art cybersecurity orchestration & automation primitives. To encourage adoption, the resulting implementation is released as open-source, which, to the extent of our knowledge, comprises the first publicly available & documented work in this domain, supporting the broader uptake of CACAO playbooks & promoting the widespread use of interoperable automation and orchestration mechanisms in cybersecurity operations.

### Path Pooling: Train-Free Structure Enhancement for Efficient Knowledge   Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Hairu Wang, Yuan Feng, Xike Xie, S Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:48:30Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models achieve strong success in many tasks, they still suffer from hallucinations and knowledge deficiencies in real-world applications. Many knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) methods enhance the quality and credibility of LLMs by leveraging structure and semantic information in KGs as external knowledge bases. However, these methods struggle to effectively incorporate structure information, either incurring high computational costs or underutilizing available knowledge. Inspired by smoothing operations in graph representation learning, we propose path pooling, a simple, train-free strategy that introduces structure information through a novel path-centric pooling operation. It seamlessly integrates into existing KG-RAG methods in a plug-and-play manner, enabling richer structure information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating the path pooling into the state-of-the-art KG-RAG method consistently improves performance across various settings while introducing negligible additional cost. Code is coming soon at https://github.com/hrwang00/path-pooling.

### ORANSight-2.0: Foundational LLMs for O-RAN
**Authors**: Pranshav Gajjar, Vijay K. Shah

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:44:31Z

**Summary**: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.

### BigMac: A Communication-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Model Structure for   Fast Training and Inference
**Authors**: Zewen Jin, Shengnan Wang, Jiaan Zhu, Hongrui Zhan, Youhui Bai, Lin Zhang, Zhenyu Ming, Cheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:28:39Z

**Summary**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear increase in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE structure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of MoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication introduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained structure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence contributing to heavier communication overhead.   In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also fine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac is mainly due to that we abandon the \textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{d}escend-\textbf{a}scend-\textbf{c}ommunicate (CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All communication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac designs an efficient \textbf{d}escend-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{a}scend (DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at the entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the communication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to DCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in BigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that BigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs with the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters. Equally importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 3.09$\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\times$ for inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron, Tutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.

### Memory-augmented Query Reconstruction for LLM-based Knowledge Graph   Reasoning
**Authors**: Mufan Xu, Gewen Liang, Kehai Chen, Wei Wang, Xun Zhou, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:28:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) tasks by planning and interacting with knowledge graphs. However, existing methods often confuse tool utilization with knowledge reasoning, harming readability of model outputs and giving rise to hallucinatory tool invocations, which hinder the advancement of KGQA. To address this issue, we propose Memory-augmented Query Reconstruction for LLM-based Knowledge Graph Reasoning (MemQ) to decouple LLM from tool invocation tasks using LLM-built query memory. By establishing a memory module with explicit descriptions of query statements, the proposed MemQ facilitates the KGQA process with natural language reasoning and memory-augmented query reconstruction. Meanwhile, we design an effective and readable reasoning to enhance the LLM's reasoning capability in KGQA. Experimental results that MemQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks WebQSP and CWQ.

### Rewarding Curse: Analyze and Mitigate Reward Modeling Issues for LLM   Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiachun Li, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Jiexin Xu, Huaijun Li, Xiaojian Jiang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:20:24Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.

### LLM-based Discriminative Reasoning for Knowledge Graph Question   Answering
**Authors**: Mufan Xu, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:14:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based on generative pre-trained Transformer have achieved remarkable performance on knowledge graph question-answering (KGQA) tasks. However, LLMs often produce ungrounded subgraph planning or reasoning results in KGQA due to the hallucinatory behavior brought by the generative paradigm. To tackle this issue, we propose READS to reformulate the KGQA process into discriminative subtasks, which simplifies the search space for each subtasks. Based on the subtasks, we design a new corresponding discriminative inference strategy to conduct the reasoning for KGQA, thereby alleviating hallucination and ungrounded reasoning issues in LLMs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms multiple strong comparison methods, along with achieving state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks WebQSP and CWQ.

### FinTMMBench: Benchmarking Temporal-Aware Multi-Modal RAG in Finance
**Authors**: Fengbin Zhu, Junfeng Li, Liangming Pan, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Chao Wang, Huanbo Luan, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T07:13:59Z

**Summary**: Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.

### Sketch-of-Thought: Efficient LLM Reasoning with Adaptive   Cognitive-Inspired Sketching
**Authors**: Simon A. Aytes, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T06:57:17Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in their intermediate outputs, which increases computational overhead. We introduce Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a novel prompting framework that combines cognitive-inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to minimize token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible framework that can incorporate any custom reasoning paradigms based on cognitive science, and we instantiate it with three such paradigms - Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons - each tailored to different reasoning tasks and selected dynamically via a lightweight routing model. Through comprehensive evaluation across 15 reasoning datasets with multiple languages and multimodal scenarios, we demonstrate that SoT achieves token reductions of 76% with negligible accuracy impact. In certain domains like mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens. Our code is publicly available: https://www.github.com/SimonAytes/SoT.

### SplatPose: Geometry-Aware 6-DoF Pose Estimation from Single RGB Image   via 3D Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Linqi Yang, Xiongwei Zhao, Qihao Sun, Ke Wang, Ao Chen, Peng Kang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T06:40:06Z

**Summary**: 6-DoF pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications in augmented reality and robotics. Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.

### Bootstrapping Object-level Planning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: David Paulius, Alejandro Agostini, Benedict Quartey, George Konidaris

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T06:18:03Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new method that extracts knowledge from a large language model (LLM) to produce object-level plans, which describe high-level changes to object state, and uses them to bootstrap task and motion planning (TAMP). Existing work uses LLMs to directly output task plans or generate goals in representations like PDDL. However, these methods fall short because they rely on the LLM to do the actual planning or output a hard-to-satisfy goal. Our approach instead extracts knowledge from an LLM in the form of plan schemas as an object-level representation called functional object-oriented networks (FOON), from which we automatically generate PDDL subgoals. Our method markedly outperforms alternative planning strategies in completing several pick-and-place tasks in simulation.

### Explicit vs. Implicit: Investigating Social Bias in Large Language   Models through Self-Reflection
**Authors**: Yachao Zhao, Bo Wang, Yan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-07T06:16:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit various biases and stereotypes in their generated content. While extensive research has investigated bias in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, leaving the more nuanced implicit biases largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a novel "self-reflection" based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases, where explicit biases manifest as mild stereotypes while implicit biases show strong stereotypes. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency. Our experiments examine the effects of training data scale, model parameters, and alignment techniques. Results indicate that while explicit bias diminishes with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Notably, contemporary alignment methods (e.g., RLHF, DPO) effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias. These findings suggest that while scaling up models and alignment training can address explicit bias, the challenge of implicit bias requires novel approaches beyond current methodologies.
