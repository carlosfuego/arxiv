**Authors**: Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava, Matthew Gwilliam

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

### Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Shuo Xing, Lanqing Guo, Hongyuan Hua, Seoyoung Lee, Peiran Li, Yufei Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Zhengzhong Tu

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

**Authors**: Miryeong Kwon, Donghyun Gouk, Junhyeok Jang, Jinwoo Baek, Hyunwoo You, Sangyoon Ji, Hongjoo Jung, Junseok Moon, Seungkwan Kang, Seungjun Lee, Myoungsoo Jung

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:44:04Z

**Summary**: This paper explores how Compute Express Link (CXL) can transform PCIe-based block storage into a scalable, byte-addressable working memory. We address the challenges of adapting block storage to CXL's memory-centric model by emphasizing cacheability as a key enabler and advocating for Type 3 endpoint devices, referred to as CXL-SSDs. To validate our approach, we prototype a CXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms, Determinism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data persistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves 10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces latency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality, CXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating block storage into CXL's ecosystem and provides a foundation for future memory-storage convergence.

**Authors**: Shufan Li, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Hritik Bansal, Akash Gokul, Yusuke Kato, Kazuki Kozuka, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:17:40Z

**Summary**: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910 NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

### VideoMAR: Autoregressive Video Generatio with Continuous Tokens
**Authors**: Hu Yu, Biao Gong, Hangjie Yuan, DanDan Zheng, Weilong Chai, Jingdong Chen, Kecheng Zheng, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:44:09Z

**Summary**: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

### A Novel Compiler Transformation for Fast Sparse Matrix Multiplication in   GPUs
**Authors**: Hossein Albakri, Kazem Cheshmi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:41:35Z

**Summary**: Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the memory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities such as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory hierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but running compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due to inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new compiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices. The transformation increases data reuse in registers and caches while creating more balanced workloads for GPU computing resources. The transformation is tested on sparse neural networks in convolutional and transformer models. On an A100 GPU and across a columns of matrix B (bCols) in $ A \times B = C$ from range of 32 to 128, the transformation yields a geometric mean speedup of 1.84$\times$ to 2.27$\times$ compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines, respectively.

### eLLM: Elastic Memory Management Framework for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Jiale Xu, Rui Zhang, Yi Xiong, Cong Guo, Zihan Liu, Yangjie Zhou, Weiming Hu, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Yongjie Yuan, Junping Zhao, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:56:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.   To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

**Authors**: M. Bruff, L. Sonderhouse, K. N. David, J. Stuart, D. H. Slichter, D. Leibfried

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T01:37:55Z

**Summary**: We study the impact of an unshielded dielectric $\unicode{x2013}$ here, a bare optical fiber $\unicode{x2013}$ on a $^{40}$Ca${^+}$ ion held several hundred $\mu$m away in a cryogenic surface electrode trap. We observe distance-dependent stray electric fields of up to a few kV/m due to the dielectric, which drift on average less than 10% per month and can be fully compensated with reasonable voltages on the trap electrodes. We observe ion motional heating rates attributable to the dielectric of $\approx$30 quanta per second at an ion-fiber distance of 215(4) $\mu$m and $\approx$1.5 MHz motional frequency. These results demonstrate the viability of using unshielded, trap-integrated dielectric objects such as miniature optical cavities or other optical elements in cryogenic surface electrode ion traps.

### CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal   Diffusion
**Authors**: Jiahua Ma, Yiran Qin, Yixiong Li, Xuanqi Liao, Yulan Guo, Ruimao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T17:59:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

### Keigo: Co-designing Log-Structured Merge Key-Value Stores with a   Non-Volatile, Concurrency-aware Storage Hierarchy (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Rúben Adão, Zhongjie Wu, Changjun Zhou, Oana Balmau, João Paulo, Ricardo Macedo

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T15:25:11Z

**Summary**: We present Keigo, a concurrency- and workload-aware storage middleware that enhances the performance of log-structured merge key-value stores (LSM KVS) when they are deployed on a hierarchy of storage devices. The key observation behind Keigo is that there is no one-size-fits-all placement of data across the storage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the benefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across different devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We introduce three techniques - concurrency-aware data placement, persistent read-only caching, and context-based I/O differentiation. Keigo is portable across different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require extensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as RocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. We evaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it improves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4x for write- and 18x for read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and specialized LSM KVS.

### LongSpec: Long-Context Lossless Speculative Decoding with Efficient   Drafting and Verification
**Authors**: Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T05:58:01Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts, efficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly important, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly depend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising lossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as quantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are trained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable for long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long contexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed by draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation resulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context inference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing long token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses these challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the training-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that combines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable efficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec, achieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across five long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in wall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model, demonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.

### Cost-Efficient Serving of LLM Agents via Test-Time Plan Caching
**Authors**: Qizheng Zhang, Michael Wornow, Kunle Olukotun

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T04:42:30Z

**Summary**: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

### CXLMemSim: A pure software simulated CXL.mem for performance   characterization
**Authors**: Yiwei Yang, Brian Zhao, Yusheng Zheng, Pooneh Safayenikoo, Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Andi Quinn

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T04:00:42Z

**Summary**: CXLMemSim is a fast, lightweight simulation framework that enables performance characterization of memory systems based on Compute Express Link (CXL) .mem technology. CXL.mem allows disaggregation and pooling of memory to mitigate memory stranding (underutilized memory trapped on fully loaded servers) in cloud and datacenter environments. However, CXL-attached memory introduces additional latency and bandwidth constraints compared to local DRAM, and real CXL .mem hardware is not yet widely available for empirical evaluation. CXLMemSim addresses this gap by attaching to unmodified applications and simulating CXL-based memory pools in software. It operates by tracing memory allocations and accesses using efficient kernel probes and hardware performance counters, dividing execution into epochs, and injecting timing delays to emulate various CXL .mem latency/bandwidth characteristics. This approach incurs modest runtime overhead while preserving realistic load/store memory access patterns. We implement CXLMemSim on commodity hardware without special devices, and our evaluation shows that it runs orders of magnitude faster than cycle-accurate simulators (e.g., Gem5) for real-world workloads, while accurately modeling the performance impact of CXL .mem. We demonstrate use cases where CXLMemSim enables experimentation with memory pooling configurations, scheduling policies, data migration strategies, and caching techniques that were previously infeasible to evaluate at scale. Key findings include the viability of software-based CXL .mem emulation with low overhead, insights into latency and congestion effects in memory pools, and guidance for system designers to optimize memory disaggregation. Overall, CXLMemSim provides a practical and extensible platform for researchers and practitioners to explore CXL.mem innovations before real hardware becomes commonplace.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T02:24:51Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

### All-optical electric field sensing with nanodiamond-doped polymer thin   films
**Authors**: Roy Styles, Mengke Han, Toon Goris, James Partridge, Brett C. Johnson, Blanca del Rosal, Amanda N. Abraham, Heike Ebendorff-Heidepriem, Brant C. Gibson, Nikolai Dontschuk, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Philipp Reineck

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T00:26:21Z

**Summary**: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.

### glass: ordered set data structure for client-side order books
**Authors**: Viktor Krapivensky

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T20:46:20Z

**Summary**: The "ordered set" abstract data type with operations "insert", "erase", "find", "min", "max", "next" and "prev" is ubiquitous in computer science. It is usually implemented with red-black trees, $B$-trees, or $B^+$-trees. We present our implementation of ordered set based on a trie. It only supports integer keys (as opposed to keys of any strict weakly ordered type) and is optimized for market data, namely for what we call sequential locality. The following is the list of what we believe to be novelties:   * Cached path to exploit sequential locality, and fast truncation thereof on erase operation;   * A hash table (or, rather, a cache table) with hard O(1) time guarantees on any operation to speed up key lookup (up to a pre-leaf node);   * Hardware-accelerated "find next/previous set bit" operations with BMI2 instruction set extension on x86-64;   * Order book-specific features: the preemption principle and the tree restructure operation that prevent the tree from consuming too much memory.   We achieve the following speedups over C++'s standard std::map container: 6x-20x on modifying operations, 30x on lookup operations, 9x-15x on real market data, and a more modest 2x-3x speedup on iteration. In this paper, we discuss our implementation.

### Cache-Aided Variable-Length Coding with Perfect Privacy
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T17:17:38Z

**Summary**: A cache-aided compression problem with perfect privacy is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits. The server is connected to $K$ users through a shared link, where each user has access to a local cache of size $MF$ bits. In the placement phase, the server fills the users$'$ caches without prior knowledge of their future demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared link. The users and the server have access to a shared secret key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not disclose any information about $X$, i.e., $X$ and $\cal C$ are statistically independent yielding $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$, which corresponds to the perfect privacy constraint; ii. User $i$ is able to decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using its local cache $Z_i$, delivered message $\cal C$, and the shared secret key $W$. Due to the correlation of database with the private attribute, existing codes for cache-aided delivery do not fulfill the perfect privacy constraint. Indeed, in this work, we propose a lossless variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In particular, we use two-part code construction and Functional Representation Lemma. Furthermore, we propose an alternative coding scheme based on the minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results obtained by Functional Representation Lemma.

**Summary**: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling (CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches, which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower perplexity under the same KV budgets.

### Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy
**Authors**: Kangye Ji, Yuan Meng, Hanyun Cui, Ye Li, Shengjia Hua, Lei Chen, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T13:14:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.

### On Immutable Memory Systems for Artificial Agents: A Blockchain-Indexed   Automata-Theoretic Framework Using ECDH-Keyed Merkle Chains
**Authors**: Craig Steven Wright

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T08:43:56Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth.

### InfiniSST: Simultaneous Translation of Unbounded Speech with Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T06:38:23Z

**Summary**: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code and demo at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

### Multipole Attention for Efficient Long Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sebastian Zhao, Luca Manolache, Sehoon Kim, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T03:00:40Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

### Latent Multi-Head Attention for Small Language Models
**Authors**: Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T02:57:37Z

**Summary**: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

### BLITZSCALE: Fast and Live Large Model Autoscaling with O(1) Host Caching
**Authors**: Dingyan Zhang, Haotian Wang, Yang Liu, Xingda Wei, Yizhou Shan, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T13:04:14Z

**Summary**: Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with no or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized, and (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction for inference from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled ones without waiting for the parameters to be fully loaded. Under real-world workloads, our system BLITZSCALE achieves up to 94 % lower tail latency reductions compared to state-of-the-art autoscaling system (ServerlessLLM), and it reduces the GPU time used for serving by 49 % when compared with serving systems that do not support autoscaling like DistServe and vLLM with the same service-level-agreement.

### I Know What You Said: Unveiling Hardware Cache Side-Channels in Local   Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Zibo Gao, Junjie Hu, Feng Guo, Yixin Zhang, Yinglong Han, Siyuan Liu, Haiyang Li, Zhiqiang Lv

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T08:41:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta, Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege.   We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).

### ReFrame: Layer Caching for Accelerated Inference in Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Lufei Liu, Tor M. Aamodt

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T20:17:43Z

**Summary**: Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

### Real-Time Agile Software Management for Edge and Fog Computing Based   Smart City Infrastructure
**Authors**: Debasish Jana, Pinakpani Pal, Pawan Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T20:00:53Z

**Summary**: The evolution of smart cities demands scalable, secure, and energy-efficient architectures for real-time data processing. With the number of IoT devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2030, traditional cloud-based systems are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, latency, and energy limitations. This paper leverages the ROOF (Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation) framework with decentralized computing at intermediary fog and peripheral edge network layers to reduce latency by processing data near its point of origin. ROOF features fog caching to avoid redundancy, ultra-low-power wireless transmission for energy savings, and AI-driven resource allocation for efficiency. Security is enhanced through TLS encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and edge-level access control. Case studies from Bhubaneswar, Barcelona and Copenhagen validate the use of ROOF in traffic systems and environmental monitoring. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges and prospects of AI-driven analytics in smart urban infrastructure.

**Authors**: Zhuocheng Zhang, Yang Feng, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T13:16:31Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a pivotal role in modern large language model applications, with numerous existing frameworks offering a wide range of functionalities to facilitate the development of RAG systems. However, we have identified several persistent challenges in these frameworks, including difficulties in algorithm reproduction and sharing, lack of new techniques, and high system overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FlexRAG}, an open-source framework specifically designed for research and prototyping. FlexRAG supports text-based, multimodal, and network-based RAG, providing comprehensive lifecycle support alongside efficient asynchronous processing and persistent caching capabilities. By offering a robust and flexible solution, FlexRAG enables researchers to rapidly develop, deploy, and share advanced RAG systems.

### Efficient Unified Caching for Accelerating Heterogeneous AI Workloads
**Authors**: Tianze Wang, Yifei Liu, Chen Chen, Pengfei Zuo, Jiawei Zhang, Qizhen Weng, Yin Chen, Zhenhua Han, Jieru Zhao, Quan Chen, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T06:36:54Z

**Summary**: Modern AI clusters, which host diverse workloads like data pre-processing, training and inference, often store the large-volume data in cloud storage and employ caching frameworks to facilitate remote data access. To avoid code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed. Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the overall job completion time by 52.2%.

### ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable   Compression
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T06:17:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.

### KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache   at a Large Cloud Provider
**Authors**: Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T02:18:16Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

### Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight   Architecture DDPM
**Authors**: Xun Li, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T00:52:10Z

**Summary**: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T21:01:43Z

**Summary**: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.

### Cartridges: Lightweight and general-purpose long context representations   via self-study
**Authors**: Sabri Eyuboglu, Ryan Ehrlich, Simran Arora, Neel Guha, Dylan Zinsley, Emily Liu, Will Tennien, Atri Rudra, James Zou, Azalia Mirhoseini, Christopher Re

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T17:58:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL). Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However, we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective. We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference time without retraining.

### CnC-PRAC: Coalesce, not Cache, Per Row Activation Counts for an   Efficient in-DRAM Rowhammer Mitigation
**Authors**: Chris S. Lin, Jeonghyun Woo, Prashant J. Nair, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T17:28:38Z

**Summary**: JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for DDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations using per-row activation counts. While recent PRAC implementations enable holistic mitigation of Rowhammer attacks, they impose slowdowns of up to 10% due to the increased DRAM timings for performing a read-modify-write of the counter. Alternatively, recent work, Chronus, addresses these slowdowns, but incurs energy overheads due to the additional DRAM activations for counters. In this paper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both performance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching activation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and coalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our design achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of data accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter read-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together, these enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost 75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC implementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead of 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.

### Beyond Homogeneous Attention: Memory-Efficient LLMs via   Fourier-Approximated KV Cache
**Authors**: Xiaoran Liu, Siyang He, Qiqi Wang, Ruixiao Li, Yuerong Song, Zhigeng Liu, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Qipeng Guo, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T15:35:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value (KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel, FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance compromise.

### FlashBack:Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling for Long   Context Inference
**Authors**: Runheng Liu, Xingchen Xiao, Heyan Huang, Zewen Chi, Zhijing Wu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T08:32:26Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM) by integrating large language models (LLM) with relevant documents from an external corpus is a proven method for enabling the LLM to generate information beyond the scope of its pre-training corpus. Previous work utilizing retrieved content by simply prepending it to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. In this paper, we propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption. FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache instead of prepending them. And we introduce Marking Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the boundary of the appending context during fine-tuning. Our experiments on testing generation quality show that FlashBack can remain decent generation quality in perplexity. And the inference speed of FlashBack is up to $4\times$ faster than the prepending counterpart on a 7B LLM (Llama 2) in the runtime test. Via bypassing unnecessary re-computation, it demonstrates an advancement by achieving significantly faster inference speed, and this heightened efficiency will substantially reduce inferential cost.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T07:04:46Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, an extensible open-source framework that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

### Lag-Relative Sparse Attention In Long Context Training
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, Wanyi Huang, Mandi Liu, Huaijun Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T06:49:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA) anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the question-answer tuning task.

### Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect
**Authors**: Jiaju Yang, Lujun Wei, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Wei Niu, Jiarui Chen, Jun Du, Yong Pu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T02:54:42Z

**Summary**: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T > 23 K) and low (T < 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.

### Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference via KV Cache Clustering
**Authors**: Jie Hu, Shengnan Wang, Yutong He, Ping Gong, Jiawei Yi, Juncheng Zhang, Youhui Bai, Renhai Chen, Gong Zhang, Cheng Li, Kun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T02:36:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead, Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

### Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast Sampling: The   Three Golden Principles
**Authors**: Qingyan Wei, Yaojie Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T02:28:47Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

### A4: Microarchitecture-Aware LLC Management for Datacenter Servers with   Emerging I/O Devices
**Authors**: Haneul Park, Jiaqi Lou, Sangjin Lee, Yifan Yuan, Kyoung Soo Park, Yongseok Son, Ipoom Jeong, Nam Sung Kim

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T21:57:27Z

**Summary**: In modern server CPUs, the Last-Level Cache (LLC) serves not only as a victim cache for higher-level private caches but also as a buffer for low-latency DMA transfers between CPU cores and I/O devices through Direct Cache Access (DCA). However, prior work has shown that high-bandwidth network-I/O devices can rapidly flood the LLC with packets, often causing significant contention with co-running workloads. One step further, this work explores hidden microarchitectural properties of the Intel Xeon CPUs, uncovering two previously unrecognized LLC contentions triggered by emerging high-bandwidth I/O devices. Specifically, (C1) DMA-written cache lines in LLC ways designated for DCA (referred to as DCA ways) are migrated to certain LLC ways (denoted as inclusive ways) when accessed by CPU cores, unexpectedly contending with non-I/O cache lines within the inclusive ways. In addition, (C2) high-bandwidth storage-I/O devices, which are increasingly common in datacenter servers, benefit little from DCA while contending with (latency-sensitive) network-I/O devices within DCA ways. To this end, we present \design, a runtime LLC management framework designed to alleviate both (C1) and (C2) among diverse co-running workloads, using a hidden knob and other hardware features implemented in those CPUs. Additionally, we demonstrate that \design can also alleviate other previously known network-I/O-driven LLC contentions. Overall, it improves the performance of latency-sensitive, high-priority workloads by 51\% without notably compromising that of low-priority workloads.

### SwiftSpec: Ultra-Low Latency LLM Decoding by Scaling Asynchronous   Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ziyi Zhang, Ziheng Jiang, Chengquan Jiang, Menghan Yu, Size Zheng, Haibin Lin, Henry Hoffmann, Xin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T21:15:58Z

**Summary**: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding (which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements (between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused, latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5 model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

**Authors**: F. Nisa Bostanci, Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, Ataberk Olgun, A. Giray Yaglikci, Ismail Emir Yuksel, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Zulal Bingol, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T20:38:42Z

**Summary**: We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates expensive cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric memory-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert channels that leverage different PiM approaches (i.e., processing-near-memory and processing-using-memory) to establish high-throughput covert communication channels. Our covert channels achieve 8.2 Mb/s and 14.8 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is 3.6x and 6.5x higher than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channel. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently-running victim applications with a low error rate. Our source-code is openly and freely available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/IMPACT.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T13:33:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.

**Authors**: Fanxu Meng, Pingzhi Tang, Xiaojuan Tang, Zengwei Yao, Xing Sun, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T11:45:57Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present TransMLA, a framework that seamlessly converts any GQA-based pre-trained model into an MLA-based model. Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.

**Authors**: Xiaoyao Zhong, Haotian Li, Jiabao Jin, Mingyu Yang, Deming Chu, Xiangyu Wang, Zhitao Shen, Wei Jia, George Gu, Yi Xie, Xuemin Lin, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song, Peng Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T11:26:10Z

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index.   This paper introduces VSAG, an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory access: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii) efficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.

### Qronos: Correcting the Past by Shaping the Future... in Post-Training   Quantization
**Authors**: Shihao Zhang, Haoyu Zhang, Ian Colbert, Rayan Saab

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T00:25:14Z

**Summary**: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Sebastian Zhao, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T22:50:44Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input context in order to perform complex tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations in order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also present a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context length. We evaluate our method on long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3.1$\times$ reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8$\times$ reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy gap for the LLaMA-2-7B-32K, LWM-Text-Chat-1M, and Longchat-7B-v1.5-32K models. Futhermore, we implement kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4$\times$ speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/SqueezedAttention.

### ETS: Efficient Tree Search for Inference-Time Scaling
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Suhong Moon, Kerem Dilmen, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Nicholas Lee, Michael W. Mahoney, Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T21:59:20Z

**Summary**: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation. Code is available at: https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/ETS.

### EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for   Vision-Language-Action Models
**Authors**: Yantai Yang, Yuhao Wang, Zichen Wen, Luo Zhongwei, Chang Zou, Zhipeng Zhang, Chuan Wen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T18:34:57Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

### Mainframe-style channel controllers for modern disaggregated memory   systems
**Authors**: Zikai Liu, Jasmin Schult, Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T14:03:13Z

**Summary**: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.   However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.   In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T09:08:59Z

**Summary**: Minibeam and microbeam radiation therapy promise improved treatment outcomes through reduced normal tissue toxicity at better tumor control rates. The lack of suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of minibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We developed and constructed the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with technology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and microbeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding the first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with the LFXT prototype. The focal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable side effects throughout the follow-up period after whole-brain 260 $\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical setting.

### NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs
**Authors**: Semyon Savkin, Eitan Porat, Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T06:01:15Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

### SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional   Autonomous Agent Systems
**Authors**: Peiran Li, Xinkai Zou, Zhuohang Wu, Ruifeng Li, Shuo Xing, Hanwen Zheng, Zhikai Hu, Yuping Wang, Haoxi Li, Qin Yuan, Yingmo Zhang, Zhengzhong Tu

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T03:14:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.

### Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video   Generation
**Authors**: Shanchuan Lin, Ceyuan Yang, Hao He, Jianwen Jiang, Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Yang Zhao, Xuefeng Xiao, Lu Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T03:04:23Z

**Summary**: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

### ScalableHD: Scalable and High-Throughput Hyperdimensional Computing   Inference on Multi-Core CPUs
**Authors**: Dhruv Parikh, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T22:46:12Z

**Summary**: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that represents and manipulates information using high-dimensional vectors, called hypervectors (HV). Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and inherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often suffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative training of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference, however, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet, efficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose multi-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and high-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a two-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across cores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are streamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling on-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance, ScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding. Further, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch sizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload characteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits HDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to 10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines such as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity recognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy. Furthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of cores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.

### A Stable Whitening Optimizer for Efficient Neural Network Training
**Authors**: Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T22:01:14Z

**Summary**: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock time.

### MagCache: Fast Video Generation with Magnitude-Aware Cache
**Authors**: Zehong Ma, Longhui Wei, Feng Wang, Shiliang Zhang, Qi Tian

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T17:59:02Z

**Summary**: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

### STI-SNN: A 0.14 GOPS/W/PE Single-Timestep Inference FPGA-based SNN   Accelerator with Algorithm and Hardware Co-Design
**Authors**: Kainan Wang, Chengyi Yang, Chengting Yu, Yee Sin Ang, Bo Wang, Aili Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T14:29:02Z

**Summary**: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted attention for their event-driven characteristics and high energy efficiency. However, the temporal dependency and irregularity of spikes present significant challenges for hardware parallel processing and data reuse, leading to some existing accelerators falling short in processing latency and energy efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the STI-SNN accelerator, designed for resource-constrained applications with high energy efficiency, flexibility, and low latency. The accelerator is designed through algorithm and hardware co-design. Firstly, STI-SNN can perform inference in a single timestep. At the algorithm level, we introduce a temporal pruning approach based on the temporal efficient training (TET) loss function. This approach alleviates spike disappearance during timestep reduction, maintains inference accuracy, and expands TET's application. In hardware design, we analyze data access patterns and adopt the output stationary (OS) dataflow, eliminating the need to store membrane potentials and access memory operations. Furthermore, based on the OS dataflow, we propose a compressed and sorted representation of spikes, then cached in the line buffer to reduce the memory access cost and improve reuse efficiency. Secondly, STI-SNN supports different convolution methods. By adjusting the computation mode of processing elements (PEs) and parameterizing the computation array, STI-SNN can accommodate lightweight models based on depthwise separable convolutions (DSCs), further enhancing hardware flexibility. Lastly, STI-SNN also supports both inter-layer and intra-layer parallel processing. For inter-layer parallelism, we ...

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T13:50:34Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits. The codebase is at https://github.com/IBM/activated-lora.

### LiftVSR: Lifting Image Diffusion to Video Super-Resolution via Hybrid   Temporal Modeling with Only 4$\times$RTX 4090s
**Authors**: Xijun Wang, Xin Li, Bingchen Li, Zhibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T07:49:33Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

### Draft-based Approximate Inference for LLMs
**Authors**: Kevin Galim, Ethan Ewer, Wonjun Kang, Minjae Lee, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T02:37:46Z

**Summary**: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.

### GATE: Geometry-Aware Trained Encoding
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister, Carsten Benthin

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T19:13:16Z

**Summary**: The encoding of input parameters is one of the fundamental building blocks of neural network algorithms. Its goal is to map the input data to a higher-dimensional space, typically supported by trained feature vectors. The mapping is crucial for the efficiency and approximation quality of neural networks. We propose a novel geometry-aware encoding called GATE that stores feature vectors on the surface of triangular meshes. Our encoding is suitable for neural rendering-related algorithms, for example, neural radiance caching. It also avoids limitations of previous hash-based encoding schemes, such as hash collisions, selection of resolution versus scene size, and divergent memory access. Our approach decouples feature vector density from geometry density using mesh colors, while allowing for finer control over neural network training and adaptive level-of-detail.

### Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video   Diffusion
**Authors**: Xun Huang, Zhengqi Li, Guande He, Mingyuan Zhou, Eli Shechtman

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

### DBudgetKV: Dynamic Budget in KV Cache Compression for Ensuring Optimal   Performance
**Authors**: Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T15:31:53Z

**Summary**: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. These techniques are often designed with a pre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input lengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in inconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.

### $d$-Wave Flat Fermi Surface in Altermagnets Enables Maximum   Charge-to-Spin Conversion
**Authors**: Junwen Lai, Tianye Yu, Peitao Liu, Long Liu, Guozhong Xing, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T12:41:31Z

**Summary**: Altermagnets combine antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnet-like spin splitting, a duality that unlocks ultrafast spin-dependent responses. This unique property creates unprecedented opportunities for spin-current generation, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of conventional spin-transfer and spin-orbit torque approaches in magnetic memory technologies. Here, we establish a fundamental relationship between Fermi surface geometry and time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin currents in altermagnets through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that a $d$-wave altermagnet with a flat Fermi surface can achieve a theoretical upper limit of charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (CSE) of 100%. This mechanism is realized in the newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic metal KV$_2$O$_2$Se, which exhibits a CSE of $\sim$78% at the charge neutrality point, nearly double that of RuO$_2$, setting a new record for $\mathcal{T}$-odd CSE. Under electron doping, this efficiency further increases to $\sim$98%, approaching the theoretical limit. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents via Fermi surface geometry engineering and provides key insights for developing next-generation altermagnet-based memory devices.

### Fast ECoT: Efficient Embodied Chain-of-Thought via Thoughts Reuse
**Authors**: Zhekai Duan, Yuan Zhang, Shikai Geng, Gaowen Liu, Joschka Boedecker, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T11:04:13Z

**Summary**: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (ECoT) reasoning enhances vision-language-action (VLA) models by improving performance and interpretability through intermediate reasoning steps. However, its sequential autoregressive token generation introduces significant inference latency, limiting real-time deployment. We propose Fast ECoT, an inference-time acceleration method that exploits the structured and repetitive nature of ECoT to (1) cache and reuse high-level reasoning across timesteps and (2) parallelise the generation of modular reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous scheduler that decouples reasoning from action decoding, further boosting responsiveness. Fast ECoT requires no model changes or additional training and integrates easily into existing VLA pipelines. Experiments in both simulation (LIBERO) and real-world robot tasks show up to a 7.5% reduction in latency with comparable or improved task success rate and reasoning faithfulness, bringing ECoT policies closer to practical real-time deployment.

### ParallelComp: Parallel Long-Context Compressor for Length Extrapolation
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Chenyang Zhao, Chiwun Yang, Fanghua Ye, Hongxia Yang, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T09:48:43Z

**Summary**: Extrapolating ultra-long contexts (text length >128K) remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), as most training-free extrapolation methods are not only severely limited by memory bottlenecks, but also suffer from the attention sink, which restricts their scalability and effectiveness in practice. In this work, we propose ParallelComp, a parallel long-context compression method that effectively overcomes the memory bottleneck, enabling 8B-parameter LLMs to extrapolate from 8K to 128K tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU in a training-free setting. ParallelComp splits the input into chunks, dynamically evicting redundant chunks and irrelevant tokens, supported by a parallel KV cache eviction mechanism. Importantly, we present a systematic theoretical and empirical analysis of attention biases in parallel attention-including the attention sink, recency bias, and middle bias-and reveal that these biases exhibit distinctive patterns under ultra-long context settings. We further design a KV cache eviction technique to mitigate this phenomenon. Experimental results show that ParallelComp enables an 8B model (trained on 8K context) to achieve 91.17% of GPT-4's performance under ultra-long contexts, outperforming closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat. We achieve a 1.76x improvement in chunk throughput, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefill stage with negligible performance loss and pave the way for scalable and robust ultra-long contexts extrapolation in LLMs. We release the code at https://github.com/menik1126/ParallelComp.

### MoQAE: Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context LLM Inference via   Mixture of Quantization-Aware Experts
**Authors**: Wei Tao, Haocheng Lu, Xiaoyang Qu, Bin Zhang, Kai Lu, Jiguang Wan, Jianzong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T08:16:24Z

**Summary**: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally, we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

### LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas   and Ad-Hoc Networks
**Authors**: Atonu Ghosh, Sudip Misra

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T07:58:19Z

**Summary**: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

### Graph-KV: Breaking Sequence via Injecting Structural Biases into Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Peihao Wang, Mufei Li, Shikun Liu, Siqi Miao, Zhangyang Wang, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T00:30:08Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1) seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly available.

### Paged Attention Meets FlexAttention: Unlocking Long-Context Efficiency   in Deployed Inference
**Authors**: Thomas Joshi, Herman Saini, Neil Dhillon, Antoni Viros i Martin, Kaoutar El Maghraoui

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T22:59:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches. In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data. Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to 2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future long-context model deployment.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T21:23:22Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T20:04:17Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the Key-Value Cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference. In this work, we propose FDC, a fast KV dimensionality compression system that eliminates the decompression overhead incurred in the existing KV dimensionality compression system, Palu, and reduces attention time. Moreover, FDC employs adaptive compression, tailoring KV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to inference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss constraint. Additionally, FDC enhances the attention kernel to balance the uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further reduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that compared to Palu, FDC can reduce Job Completion Time (JCT) by up to 64%, and delivers up to 1.97X throughput under the same latency, while maintaining 99% of the accuracy without compression. When state-of-the-art eviction and quantization methods are combined with FDC, they exhibit similar improvements compared to those combined with Palu. We open-sourced the code.

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T16:07:44Z

**Summary**: Recent nano-technological advances enable the Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration of multiple memory and logic layers in a single chip, allowing for fine-grained connections between layers and significantly alleviating main memory bottlenecks. We show for a variety of workloads, on a state-of-the-art M3D-based system, that the performance and energy bottlenecks shift from main memory to the processor core and cache hierarchy. Therefore, there is a need to revisit current designs that have been conventionally tailored to tackle the memory bottleneck. Based on the insights from our design space exploration, we propose RevaMp3D, introducing five key changes. First, we propose removing the shared last-level cache, as this delivers speedups comparable to or exceeding those from increasing its size or reducing its latency across all workloads. Second, since improving L1 cache latency has a large impact on performance, we reduce L1 latency by leveraging an M3D layout to shorten its wires. Third, we repurpose the area from the removed cache to widen and scale up pipeline structures, accommodating more in-flight requests that are efficiently served by M3D memory. To avoid latency penalties from these larger structures, we leverage M3D layouts. Fourth, to facilitate high thread-level parallelism, we propose a new fine-grained synchronization technique, using M3D's dense inter-layer connectivity. Fifth, we leverage the M3D main memory to mitigate the core bottlenecks. We propose a processor frontend design that memoizes the repetitive fetched, decoded, and reordered instructions, stores them in main memory, and turns off the relevant parts of the core when possible. RevaMp3D provides 1.2x-2.9x speedup and 1.2x-1.4x energy reduction compared to a state-of-the-art M3D system. We also analyze RevaMp3D's design decisions across various memory latencies to facilitate latency-aware design decisions.

### Value Residual Learning
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Fares Obeid, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T16:04:59Z

**Summary**: While Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in various domains, the effectiveness of information propagation through deep networks remains a critical challenge. Standard hidden state residuals often fail to adequately preserve initial token-level information in deeper layers. This paper introduces ResFormer, a novel architecture that enhances information flow by incorporating value residual connections in addition to hidden state residuals. And a variant is SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer's value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 16.11\% fewer model parameters and 20.3\% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### Efficient RL-based Cache Vulnerability Exploration by Penalizing Useless   Agent Actions
**Authors**: Kanato Nakanishi, Soramichi Akiyama

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T15:48:16Z

**Summary**: Cache-timing attacks exploit microarchitectural characteristics to leak sensitive data, posing a severe threat to modern systems. Despite its severity, analyzing the vulnerability of a given cache structure against cache-timing attacks is challenging. To this end, a method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed to automatically explore vulnerabilities for a given cache structure. However, a naive RL-based approach suffers from inefficiencies due to the agent performing actions that do not contribute to the exploration. In this paper, we propose a method to identify these useless actions during training and penalize them so that the agent avoids them and the exploration efficiency is improved. Experiments on 17 cache structures show that our training mechanism reduces the number of useless actions by up to 43.08%. This resulted in the reduction of training time by 28\% in the base case and 4.84\% in the geomean compared to a naive RL-based approach.

### Place Protections at the Right Place: Targeted Hardening for   Cryptographic Code against Spectre v1
**Authors**: Yiming Zhu, Wenchao Huang, Yan Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T09:30:12Z

**Summary**: Spectre v1 attacks pose a substantial threat to security-critical software, particularly cryptographic implementations. Existing software mitigations, however, often introduce excessive overhead by indiscriminately hardening instructions without assessing their vulnerability. We propose an analysis framework that employs a novel fixpoint algorithm to detect Spectre vulnerabilities and apply targeted hardening. The fixpoint algorithm accounts for program behavior changes induced by stepwise hardening, enabling precise, sound and efficient vulnerability detection. This framework also provides flexibility for diverse hardening strategies and attacker models, enabling customized targeted hardening. We instantiate the framework as LightSLH, which hardens program with provable security.   We evaluate LightSLH on cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, Libsodium, NaCL and PQClean. Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest overhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\% overhead in 50\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown security issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a hardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level. We successfully construct a side channel by exploiting compiler-inserted stack loads, confirming this risk. (2) Memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm still depend on secrets, even for observers with cache line granularity. These findings and results highlight the importance of applying accurate protections to specific instructions.

### Beyond Self-Repellent Kernels: History-Driven Target Towards Efficient   Nonlinear MCMC on General Graphs
**Authors**: Jie Hu, Yi-Ting Ma, Do Young Eun

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T00:52:33Z

**Summary**: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies. However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead, while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight implementation by requiring only local information between the current and proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large general graphs.

### Robustifying Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Token Reweighting
**Authors**: Tanqiu Jiang, Jiacheng Liang, Rongyi Zhu, Jiawei Zhou, Fenglong Ma, Ting Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T19:22:05Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails. In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV) caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal foundation models. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by VLMs.)

### Dialogue Without Limits: Constant-Sized KV Caches for Extended Responses   in LLMs
**Authors**: Ravi Ghadia, Avinash Kumar, Gaurav Jain, Prashant Nair, Poulami Das

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T14:03:06Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive Transformers rely on Key-Value (KV) caching to accelerate inference. However, the linear growth of the KV cache with context length leads to excessive memory consumption and bandwidth constraints. This bottleneck is particularly problematic in real-time applications -- such as chatbots and interactive assistants -- where low latency and high memory efficiency are critical. Existing methods drop distant tokens or compress states in a lossy manner, sacrificing accuracy by discarding vital context or introducing bias.   We propose MorphKV, an inference-time technique that maintains a constant-sized KV cache while preserving accuracy. MorphKV balances long-range dependencies and local coherence during text generation. It eliminates early-token bias while retaining high-fidelity context by adaptively ranking tokens through correlation-aware selection. Unlike heuristic retention or lossy compression, MorphKV iteratively refines the KV cache via lightweight updates guided by attention patterns of recent tokens. This approach captures inter-token correlation with greater accuracy, crucial for tasks like content creation and code generation. Our studies on long-response tasks show 52.9$\%$ memory savings and 18.2$\%$ higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art prior works, enabling efficient real-world deployment.

### Taming Wild Branches: Overcoming Hard-to-Predict Branches using the   Bullseye Predictor
**Authors**: Emet Behrendt, Shing Wai Pun, Prashant J. Nair

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T11:50:11Z

**Summary**: Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging the tables offers only marginal improvement.   We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache, and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI of 145.09.

### Parallel CPU-GPU Execution for LLM Inference on Constrained GPUs
**Authors**: Jiakun Fan, Yanglin Zhang, Xiangchen Li, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T01:36:34Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments.   We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings. APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference efficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for scheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient real-time LLM applications.

### Saffron-1: Towards an Inference Scaling Paradigm for LLM Safety   Assurance
**Authors**: Ruizhong Qiu, Gaotang Li, Tianxin Wei, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T18:05:45Z

**Summary**: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

### Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T09:55:59Z

**Summary**: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

### Joint Optimization of Triangle Mesh, Material, and Light from Neural   Fields with Neural Radiance Cache
**Authors**: Jiakai Sun, Weijing Zhang, Zhanjie Zhang, Tianyi Chu, Guangyuan Li, Lei Zhao, Wei Xing

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T06:35:52Z

**Summary**: Traditional inverse rendering techniques are based on textured meshes, which naturally adapts to modern graphics pipelines, but costly differentiable multi-bounce Monte Carlo (MC) ray tracing poses challenges for modeling global illumination. Recently, neural fields has demonstrated impressive reconstruction quality but falls short in modeling indirect illumination. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient inverse rendering framework that combines the strengths of both methods. Specifically, given pre-trained neural field representing the scene, we can obtain an initial estimate of the signed distance field (SDF) and create a Neural Radiance Cache (NRC), an enhancement over the traditional radiance cache used in real-time rendering. By using the former to initialize differentiable marching tetrahedrons (DMTet) and the latter to model indirect illumination, we can compute the global illumination via single-bounce differentiable MC ray tracing and jointly optimize the geometry, material, and light through back propagation. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach effectively prevents indirect illumination effects from being baked into materials, thus obtaining the high-quality reconstruction of triangle mesh, Physically-Based (PBR) materials, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) light probe.

### RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Quan Wei, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi-To Wai, Yang Katie Zhao, Dongyeop Kang, Youngsuk Park, Mingyi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T02:29:18Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/OptimAI-Lab/RoSTE.

### Lumina: Real-Time Mobile Neural Rendering by Exploiting Computational   Redundancy
**Authors**: Yu Feng, Weikai Lin, Yuge Cheng, Zihan Liu, Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo, Chen Chen, Shixuan Sun, Yuhao Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T02:20:49Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has vastly advanced the pace of neural rendering, but it remains computationally demanding on today's mobile SoCs. To address this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed system, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2, and a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural rendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the computational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of 3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled with these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to further accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in Rasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy reduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets.

### The Impact of Inference Acceleration on Bias of LLMs
**Authors**: Elisabeth Kirsten, Ivan Habernal, Vedant Nanda, Muhammad Bilal Zafar

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T20:50:51Z

**Summary**: Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

### Dynamic Context Tuning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing   Multi-Turn Planning and Tool Adaptation
**Authors**: Jubin Abhishek Soni, Amit Anand, Rajesh Kumar Pandey, Aniket Abhishek Soni

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T19:47:22Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent, available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a wide range of dynamic environments.

### SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs
**Authors**: Jiahui Wang, Zuyan Liu, Yongming Rao, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at https://github.com/CR400AF-A/SparseMM.

### Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Adrian Łańcucki, Konrad Staniszewski, Piotr Nawrot, Edoardo M. Ponti

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

### Neural Inverse Rendering from Propagating Light
**Authors**: Anagh Malik, Benjamin Attal, Andrew Xie, Matthew O'Toole, David B. Lindell

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

### Unleashing Hour-Scale Video Training for Long Video-Language   Understanding
**Authors**: Jingyang Lin, Jialian Wu, Ximeng Sun, Ze Wang, Jiang Liu, Yusheng Su, Xiaodong Yu, Hao Chen, Jiebo Luo, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T17:59:04Z

**Summary**: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

### Memory Hierarchy Design for Caching Middleware in the Age of NVM
**Authors**: Shahram Ghandeharizadeh, Sandy Irani, Jenny Lam

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T14:19:05Z

**Summary**: Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a new storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are: Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g., Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain failure rates and workload characteristics. With a slim failure rate and frequent data updates, tiering of data across the different storage media that constitute the cache is superior to replication.

### Bottlenecked Transformers: Periodic KV Cache Abstraction for Generalised   Reasoning
**Authors**: Adnan Oomerjee, Zafeirios Fountas, Zhongwei Yu, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-05T13:38:34Z

**Summary**: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning (extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods; whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling alone cannot overcome.

 ### PhantomHunter: Detecting Unseen Privately-Tuned LLM-Generated Text via   Family-Aware Learning
**Authors**: Yuhui Shi, Yehan Yang, Qiang Sheng, Hao Mi, Beizhe Hu, Chaoxi Xu, Juan Cao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

### Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Your Off-the-Shelf Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava, Matthew Gwilliam

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

### GenRecal: Generation after Recalibration from Large to Small   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Byung-Kwan Lee, Ryo Hachiuma, Yong Man Ro, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Yueh-Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

### CC-LEARN: Cohort-based Consistency Learning
**Authors**: Xiao Ye, Shaswat Shrivastava, Zhaonan Li, Jacob Dineen, Shijie Lu, Avneet Ahuja, Ming Shen, Zhikun Xu, Ben Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:41:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

### PhishDebate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Phishing Website   Detection
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Selvakumar Manickam, Yung-wey Chong, Shankar Karuppayah

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:33:18Z

**Summary**: Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application requirements.

### Embedding physical symmetries into machine-learned reduced plasma   physics models via data augmentation
**Authors**: Madox C. McGrae-Menge, Jacob R. Pierce, Frederico Fiuza, E. Paulo Alves

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:26:58Z

**Summary**: Machine learning is offering powerful new tools for the development and discovery of reduced models of nonlinear, multiscale plasma dynamics from the data of first-principles kinetic simulations. However, ensuring the physical consistency of such models requires embedding fundamental symmetries of plasma dynamics. In this work, we explore a symmetry-embedding strategy based on data augmentation, where symmetry-preserving transformations (e.g., Lorentz and Galilean boosts) are applied to simulation data. Using both sparse regression and neural networks, we show that models trained on symmetry-augmented data more accurately infer the plasma fluid equations and pressure tensor closures from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. We show that this approach suppresses spurious inertial-frame-dependent correlations between dynamical variables, improves data efficiency, and significantly outperforms models trained without symmetry-augmented data, as well as commonly used theoretical pressure closure models. Our results establish symmetry-based data augmentation as a broadly applicable method for incorporating physical structure into machine-learned reduced plasma models.

### Dual-Stage Value-Guided Inference with Margin-Based Reward Adjustment   for Fast and Faithful VLM Captioning
**Authors**: Ankan Deria, Adinath Madhavrao Dukre, Feilong Tang, Sara Atito, Sudipta Roy, Muhammad Awais, Muhammad Haris Khan, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:23:36Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

### deepSURF: Detecting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Rust Through   Fuzzing LLM-Augmented Harnesses
**Authors**: Georgios Androutsopoulos, Antonio Bianchi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:18:23Z

**Summary**: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.   To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

### Exploring and Exploiting the Inherent Efficiency within Large Reasoning   Models for Self-Guided Efficiency Enhancement
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhao, Jiahe Guo, Yang Deng, Xingyu Sui, Yulin Hu, Yanyan Zhao, Wanxiang Che, Bing Qin, Tat-Seng Chua, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:18:12Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

### Aug2Search: Enhancing Facebook Marketplace Search with LLM-Generated   Synthetic Data Augmentation
**Authors**: Ruijie Xi, He Ba, Hao Yuan, Rishu Agrawal, Yuxin Tian, Ruoyan Long, Arul Prakash

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:04:04Z

**Summary**: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results. However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models. We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3) generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original and synthetic data.

### Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language   Models Considering Instruction Following Ability
**Authors**: Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:00:54Z

**Summary**: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

### J4R: Learning to Judge with Equivalent Initial State Group Relative   Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Austin Xu, Yilun Zhou, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:58:25Z

**Summary**: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM) development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains, like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning (RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3) We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and ReasoningJudgeBench.

### The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic   Routing Games
**Authors**: Lyle Goodyear, Rachel Guo, Ramesh Johari

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:53:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).   We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

### Models for cyclic infinity operads
**Authors**: Brandon Doherty, Philip Hackney

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:51:34Z

**Summary**: We construct model structures on cyclic dendroidal sets and cyclic dendroidal spaces for cyclic quasi-operads and complete cyclic dendroidal Segal spaces, respectively. We show these models are Quillen equivalent to the model structure for simplicial cyclic operads. This answers in the affirmative a question of the second author and Drummond-Cole concerning model structures for cyclic $\infty$-operads. We infer similar statements for planar cyclic $\infty$-operads, providing the model-categorical foundation needed to complete Walde's program on the relationship between cyclic 2-Segal spaces and planar cyclic $\infty$-operads.

### Further Evidence for a Direct-Collapse Origin of the Supermassive Black   Hole at the Center of the Infinity Galaxy
**Authors**: Pieter van Dokkum, Gabriel Brammer, Connor Jennings, Imad Pasha, Josephine F. W. Baggen

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:51:21Z

**Summary**: The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.

### The Infinity Galaxy: a Candidate Direct-Collapse Supermassive Black Hole   Between Two Massive, Ringed Nuclei
**Authors**: Pieter van Dokkum, Gabriel Brammer, Josephine F. W. Baggen, Michael A. Keim, Priyamvada Natarajan, Imad Pasha

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:51:15Z

**Summary**: We report the discovery of an unusual z=1.14 object, dubbed the $\infty$ galaxy, in JWST imaging of the COSMOS field. Its rest-frame near-IR light is dominated by two compact nuclei with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ Msun and a projected separation of 10 kpc. Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell around them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an $\infty$ symbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the head-on collision of two galaxies with parallel disks led to the formation of collisional rings around both of their bulges. Keck spectroscopy, VLA radio data, and Chandra X-ray data show that the $\infty$ galaxy hosts an actively accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), with quasar-like radio and X-ray luminosity. Remarkably, the SMBH is not associated with either of the two nuclei, but is in between them in both position and radial velocity. Furthermore, from excess emission in the NIRCAM F150W filter we infer that the SMBH is embedded in an extended distribution of H$\alpha$-emitting gas, with a rest-frame equivalent width ranging from 400 - 2000 Angstrom. The gas spans the entire width of the system and was likely shocked and compressed at the collision site, in a galaxy-scale equivalent of what happened in the bullet cluster. We suggest that the SMBH formed within this gas in the immediate aftermath of the collision, when it was dense and highly turbulent. If corroborated with simulations and follow-up JWST spectroscopy, this would demonstrate that `direct' SMBH formation by a runaway gravitational collapse is possible in extreme conditions.

### Router-R1: Teaching LLMs Multi-Round Routing and Aggregation via   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Haozhen Zhang, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:49:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

### A G_2G2-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory:   Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy
**Authors**: Moustafa Amin M. Radwan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:45:38Z

**Summary**: A framework is developed within an eleven-dimensional M-theory scenario where dynamical geometric moduli, originating from a $G_{\mathrm{2}}$-holonomy compactification, generate an evolving cosmological term, $\Lambda(z)$. This ``Geometric Vacuum Energy'' (GVE) is shown to be consistent across both cosmological and astrophysical scales. We demonstrate that a natural attractor solution alleviates the Hubble tension, yielding an inferred $H_0 \approx 69.4\ \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and a suppressed structure growth parameter $S_8 \approx 0.67$, while remaining in excellent agreement with cosmic chronometer data ($\chi^2/N \approx 0.44$). Its predictions in the strong-gravity regime profoundly strengthen the framework's self-consistency. We show that this model supports stable, hairy black hole solutions whose existence conditions are congruent with the cosmological attractor ($\Phi_{\text{horizon}} \leftrightarrow \Phi_{\text{cosmology}}$). Furthermore, these objects exhibit a rich, falsifiable phenomenology, including (i) the definitive breaking of isospectrality in their gravitational-wave quasi-normal modes, (ii) a suppressed Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, and (iii) unique thermodynamic and electromagnetic accretion signatures. These interconnected findings highlight a pathway where a single, theoretically-motivated framework can naturally reconcile multiple observational puzzles.

### LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Gabrel J. Perin, Runjin Chen, Xuxi Chen, Nina S. T. Hirata, Zhangyang Wang, Junyuan Hong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:30:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

### LiteGD: Lightweight and dynamic GPU Dispatching for Large-scale   Heterogeneous Clusters
**Authors**: Kunming Zhang, Hanlong Liao, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:10:17Z

**Summary**: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity. However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step, which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy (approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale heterogeneous environments.

### Lean Workbook: A large-scale Lean problem set formalized from natural   language math problems
**Authors**: Huaiyuan Ying, Zijian Wu, Yihan Geng, Zheng Yuan, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:07:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, especially in solving mathematical problems. However, large language models are not good at math theorem proving using formal languages like Lean. A significant challenge in this area is the scarcity of training data available in these formal languages. To address this issue, we propose a novel pipeline that iteratively generates and filters synthetic data to translate natural language mathematical problems into Lean 4 statements, and vice versa. Our results indicate that the synthetic data pipeline can provide useful training data and improve the performance of LLMs in translating and understanding complex mathematical problems and proofs. Our final dataset contains about 57K formal-informal question pairs along with searched proof from the math contest forum and 21 new IMO questions. We open-source our code at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and our data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternLM/Lean-Workbook.

### One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video   Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Yujing Sun, Lingchen Sun, Shuaizheng Liu, Rongyuan Wu, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:06:30Z

**Summary**: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

### "Generate" the Future of Work through AI: Empirical Evidence from Online   Labor Markets
**Authors**: Jin Liu, Xingchen Xu, Xi Nan, Yongjun Li, Yong Tan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:05:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate zero-shot learning capabilities across a wide range of downstream tasks. Owing to their general-purpose nature and potential to augment or even automate job functions, these systems are poised to reshape labor market dynamics. However, predicting their precise impact \textit{a priori} is challenging, given AI's simultaneous effects on both demand and supply, as well as the strategic responses of market participants. Leveraging an extensive dataset from a leading online labor platform, we document a pronounced displacement effect and an overall contraction in submarkets where required skills closely align with core LLM functionalities. Although demand and supply both decline, the reduction in supply is comparatively smaller, thereby intensifying competition among freelancers. Notably, further analysis shows that this heightened competition is especially pronounced in programming-intensive submarkets. This pattern is attributed to skill-transition effects: by lowering the human-capital barrier to programming, ChatGPT enables incumbent freelancers to enter programming tasks. Moreover, these transitions are not homogeneous, with high-skilled freelancers contributing disproportionately to the shift. Our findings illuminate the multifaceted impacts of general-purpose AI on labor markets, highlighting not only the displacement of certain occupations but also the inducement of skill transitions within the labor supply. These insights offer practical implications for policymakers, platform operators, and workers.

### DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through   Iterative Graph Refinement
**Authors**: Shaoqing Lin, Chong Teng, Fei Li, Donghong Ji, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:00:19Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

### Sensitivity Analysis of Priors in the Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive   Moving Average Model
**Authors**: Harrison Katz, Liz Medina, Robert E. Weiss

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:47:17Z

**Summary**: Prior choice can strongly influence Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (B-DARMA) inference for compositional time-series. Using simulations with (i) correct lag order, (ii) overfitting, and (iii) underfitting, we assess five priors: weakly-informative, horseshoe, Laplace, mixture-of-normals, and hierarchical. With the true lag order, all priors achieve comparable RMSE, though horseshoe and hierarchical slightly reduce bias. Under overfitting, aggressive shrinkage-especially the horseshoe-suppresses noise and improves forecasts, yet no prior rescues a model that omits essential VAR or VMA terms.   We then fit B-DARMA to daily SP 500 sector weights using an intentionally large lag structure. Shrinkage priors curb spurious dynamics, whereas weakly-informative priors magnify errors in volatile sectors. Two lessons emerge: (1) match shrinkage strength to the degree of overparameterization, and (2) prioritize correct lag selection, because no prior repairs structural misspecification. These insights guide prior selection and model complexity management in high-dimensional compositional time-series applications.

### Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI): A Multilevel Framework for   Evaluating Gender Diversity in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengyang Shan, Emily Ruth Diana, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:43:16Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

### Managing Complex Failure Analysis Workflows with LLM-based Reasoning and   Acting Agents
**Authors**: Aline Dobrovsky, Konstantin Schekotihin, Christian Burmer

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:43:10Z

**Summary**: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.   This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### Fractured Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Baohao Liao, Hanze Dong, Yuhui Xu, Doyen Sahoo, Christof Monz, Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:41:14Z

**Summary**: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

### Rethinking Distributional IVs: KAN-Powered D-IV-LATE & Model Choice
**Authors**: Charles Shaw

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:32:55Z

**Summary**: The double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework has become a cornerstone of modern causal inference, allowing researchers to utilise flexible machine learning models for the estimation of nuisance functions without introducing first-order bias into the final parameter estimate. However, the choice of machine learning model for the nuisance functions is often treated as a minor implementation detail. In this paper, we argue that this choice can have a profound impact on the substantive conclusions of the analysis. We demonstrate this by presenting and comparing two distinct Distributional Instrumental Variable Local Average Treatment Effect (D-IV-LATE) estimators. The first estimator leverages standard machine learning models like Random Forests for nuisance function estimation, while the second is a novel estimator employing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We establish the asymptotic properties of these estimators and evaluate their performance through Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application analysing the distributional effects of 401(k) participation on net financial assets reveals that the choice of machine learning model for nuisance functions can significantly alter substantive conclusions, with the KAN-based estimator suggesting more complex treatment effect heterogeneity. These findings underscore a critical "caveat emptor". The selection of nuisance function estimators is not a mere implementation detail. Instead, it is a pivotal choice that can profoundly impact research outcomes in causal inference.

### PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through   Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction
**Authors**: Shufan Li, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:29:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

### How much do language models memorize?
**Authors**: John X. Morris, Chawin Sitawarin, Chuan Guo, Narine Kokhlikyan, G. Edward Suh, Alexander M. Rush, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Saeed Mahloujifar

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:27:03Z

**Summary**: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model knows about a datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two components: unintended memorization, the information a model contains about a specific dataset, and generalization, the information a model contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until their capacity fills, at which point "grokking" begins, and unintended memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to membership inference.

### RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global   Attention Models
**Authors**: Bailin Wang, Chang Lan, Chong Wang, Ruoming Pang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:18:07Z

**Summary**: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### LaViDa: A Large Diffusion Language Model for Multimodal Understanding
**Authors**: Shufan Li, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Hritik Bansal, Akash Gokul, Yusuke Kato, Kazuki Kozuka, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:17:40Z

**Summary**: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

### Learning Algorithms in the Limit
**Authors**: Hristo Papazov, Nicolas Flammarion

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:17:03Z

**Summary**: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

### Pap2Pat: Benchmarking Outline-Guided Long-Text Patent Generation with   Patent-Paper Pairs
**Authors**: Valentin Knappich, Simon Razniewski, Anna Hätty, Annemarie Friedrich

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:08:29Z

**Summary**: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.

### LoSAM: Local Search in Additive Noise Models with Mixed Mechanisms and   General Noise for Global Causal Discovery
**Authors**: Sujai Hiremath, Promit Ghosal, Kyra Gan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:58:26Z

**Summary**: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is crucial when experiments are costly or infeasible. Additive noise models (ANMs) enable unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) identification, but existing sample-efficient ANM methods often rely on restrictive assumptions on the data generating process, limiting their applicability to real-world settings. We propose local search in additive noise models, LoSAM, a topological ordering method for learning a unique DAG in ANMs with mixed causal mechanisms and general noise distributions. We introduce new causal substructures and criteria for identifying roots and leaves, enabling efficient top-down learning. We prove asymptotic consistency and polynomial runtime, ensuring scalability and sample efficiency. We test LoSAM on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across all mixed mechanism settings.

### Lessons from Training Grounded LLMs with Verifiable Rewards
**Authors**: Shang Hong Sim, Tej Deep Pala, Vernon Toh, Hai Leong Chieu, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:58:13Z

**Summary**: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

**Authors**: Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mahshad Lotfinia, Keno Bressem, Robert Siepmann, Lisa Adams, Dyke Ferber, Christiane Kuhl, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Sven Nebelung, Daniel Truhn

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:52:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. RadioRAG shows potential to improve LLM accuracy and factuality in radiology question answering by integrating real-time domain-specific data.

### RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Le Vu Anh, Nguyen Viet Anh, Mehmet Dik, Luong Van Nghia

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:48:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

### Optimizing Web-Based AI Query Retrieval with GPT Integration in   LangChain A CoT-Enhanced Prompt Engineering Approach
**Authors**: Wenqi Guan, Yang Fang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:47:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

### Dancing on the Grain: Variety of CO and its isotopologue fluxes as a   result of surface chemistry and T Tauri disk properties
**Authors**: L. Zwicky, T. Molyarova, Á. Kóspál, P. Ábrahám

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:46:25Z

**Summary**: At the moment, one of the main ways to infer the disk mass is to use a combination of CO isotopologue line observations. A number of theoretical studies have concluded that CO must be a reliable gas tracer as its relative abundance depends on disk parameters only weakly. However, the observed line fluxes cannot always be easily used to infer the column density, much less the abundance of CO. The aim of this work is to study the dependence of the CO isotopologue millimeter line fluxes on the astrochemical model parameters of a standard protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star and to conclude whether they or their combinations can be reliably used to determine disk parameters. Our case is set apart from earlier studies in the literature by the usage of a comprehensive chemical network with grain surface chemistry together with line radiative transfer. We use the astrochemical model ANDES together with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate CO isotopologue line fluxes from a set of disks with varying key parameters (disk mass, disk radius, stellar mass, and inclination). We study how these values change with one parameter varying and others fixed and approximate the dependences log-linearly. We describe the dependences of CO isotopologue fluxes on all chosen disk parameters. Physical and chemical processes responsible for these dependences are analyzed and explained for each parameter. We show that using a combination of the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O line fluxes, the mass can be estimated only within two orders of magnitude uncertainty and characteristic radius within one order of magnitude uncertainty. We find that inclusion of grain surface chemistry reduces $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O fluxes which can explain the underestimation of disk mass in the previous studies.

### M3-JEPA: Multimodal Alignment via Multi-gate MoE based on the   Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture
**Authors**: Hongyang Lei, Xiaolong Cheng, Qi Qin, Dan Wang, Kun Fan, Huazhen Huang, Qingqing Gu, Yetao Wu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:45:27Z

**Summary**: Current multimodal learning strategies primarily optimize in the original token space. Such a framework is easy to incorporate with the backbone of pretrained language model, but might result in modality collapse. To alleviate such issues, we leverage the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) on the multimodal tasks, which converts the input embedding into the output embedding space by a predictor and then conducts the cross-modal alignment on the latent space. We implement this predictor by a Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) and name the framework as M3-JEPA, accordingly. The gating function disentangles the modality-specific and shared information and derives information-theoretic optimality. The framework is implemented with both contrastive and regularization loss, and solved by alternative gradient descent (AGD) between different multimodal tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-JEPA can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in both training and inference. Our observation suggests that M3-JEPA might become a new basis to self-supervised learning in the open world.

### KANITE: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for ITE estimation
**Authors**: Eshan Mehendale, Abhinav Thorat, Ravi Kolla, Niranjan Pedanekar

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:44:41Z

**Summary**: We introduce KANITE, a framework leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation under multiple treatments setting in causal inference. By utilizing KAN's unique abilities to learn univariate activation functions as opposed to learning linear weights by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we improve the estimates of ITEs. The KANITE framework comprises two key architectures: 1.Integral Probability Metric (IPM) architecture: This employs an IPM loss in a specialized manner to effectively align towards ITE estimation across multiple treatments. 2. Entropy Balancing (EB) architecture: This uses weights for samples that are learned by optimizing entropy subject to balancing the covariates across treatment groups. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KANITE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both $\epsilon_{\text{PEHE}}$ and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ metrics. Our experiments highlight the advantages of KANITE in achieving improved causal estimates, emphasizing the potential of KANs to advance causal inference methodologies across diverse application areas.

### Identifiable and interpretable nonparametric factor analysis
**Authors**: Maoran Xu, Steven Winter, Amy H. Herring, David B. Dunson

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:43:54Z

**Summary**: Factor models are widely used to reduce dimensionality in modeling high-dimensional data. However, there remains a need for models that can be reliably fit in modest sample sizes and are identifiable, interpretable, and flexible. To address this gap, we propose a NIFTY model that uses a linear factor structure with Gaussian residuals, but with a novel latent variable modeling structure. In particular, we model each latent variable as a one-dimensional nonlinear mapping of a uniform latent location. A key innovation is allowing different latent variables to be transformations of the same latent locations, accommodating intrinsic lower-dimensional nonlinear structures. Leveraging on pre-trained data obtained by diffusion maps and post-processing of MCMC samples, we obtain model identifiability. In addition, we softly constrain the empirical distribution of the latent locations to be close to uniform to address a latent posterior shift problem, which is common in factor models and can lead to substantial bias in parameter inferences, predictions, and generative modeling. We show good performance in density estimation and data visualization in simulations, and apply NIFTY to bird song data in an environmental monitoring application.

### Wait, We Don't Need to "Wait"! Removing Thinking Tokens Improves   Reasoning Efficiency
**Authors**: Chenlong Wang, Yuanning Feng, Dongping Chen, Zhaoyang Chu, Ranjay Krishna, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:43:36Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual, visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

### SPARE: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation for   Automatic Process Supervision and Reward Modelling
**Authors**: Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:37:59Z

**Summary**: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

### Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA: A Bi-Phase Adversarial CAPTCHA Framework
**Authors**: Xia Du, Xiaoyuan Liu, Jizhe Zhou, Zheng Lin, Chi-man Pun, Cong Wu, Tao Li, Zhe Chen, Wei Ni, Jun Luo

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:20:09Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

### Context-Informed Grounding Supervision
**Authors**: Hyunji Lee, Seunghyun Yoon, Yunjae Won, Hanseok Oh, Geewook Kim, Trung Bui, Franck Dernoncourt, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Minjoon Seo

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:13:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

### Position Paper: Rethinking Privacy in RL for Sequential Decision-making   in the Age of LLMs
**Authors**: Flint Xiaofeng Fan, Cheston Tan, Roger Wattenhofer, Yew-Soon Ong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:10:39Z

**Summary**: The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

### Multimodal Large Language Models for Medical Report Generation via   Customized Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Chunlei Li, Jingyang Hou, Yilei Shi, Jingliang Hu, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Lichao Mou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:09:34Z

**Summary**: Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in clinical practice. While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging data still deserves in-depth exploration. In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization mechanism. Our key innovation lies in generating instance-specific prompts tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine transformations derived from visual features. We propose two implementations: prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted report generation. Extensive experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical report generation. Our code will be made publicly available.

### Co-Creative Learning via Metropolis-Hastings Interaction between Humans   and AI
**Authors**: Ryota Okumura, Tadahiro Taniguchi, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:58:45Z

**Summary**: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

### Fast computation of exact confidence intervals for randomized   experiments with binary outcomes
**Authors**: P. M. Aronow, Haoge Chang, Patrick Lopatto

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:51:37Z

**Summary**: Given a randomized experiment with binary outcomes, exact confidence intervals for the average causal effect of the treatment can be computed through a series of permutation tests. This approach requires minimal assumptions and is valid for all sample sizes, as it does not rely on large-sample approximations such as those implied by the central limit theorem. We show that these confidence intervals can be found in $O(n \log n)$ permutation tests in the case of balanced designs, where the treatment and control groups have equal sizes, and $O(n^2)$ permutation tests in the general case. Prior to this work, the most efficient known constructions required $O(n^2)$ such tests in the balanced case [Li and Ding, 2016], and $O(n^4)$ tests in the general case [Rigdon and Hudgens, 2015]. Our results thus facilitate exact inference as a viable option for randomized experiments far larger than those accessible by previous methods. We also generalize our construction to produce confidence intervals for other causal estimands, including the relative risk ratio and odds ratio, yielding similar computational gains.

### All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints
**Authors**: Nikolay Blagoev, Oğuzhan Ersoy, Lydia Yiyu Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:48:33Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

### RE-IMAGINE: Symbolic Benchmark Synthesis for Reasoning Evaluation
**Authors**: Xinnuo Xu, Rachel Lawrence, Kshitij Dubey, Atharva Pandey, Risa Ueno, Fabian Falck, Aditya V. Nori, Rahul Sharma, Amit Sharma, Javier Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:35:47Z

**Summary**: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

### Uncovering Intention through LLM-Driven Code Snippet Description   Generation
**Authors**: Yusuf Sulistyo Nugroho, Farah Danisha Salam, Brittany Reid, Raula Gaikovina Kula, Kazumasa Shimari, Kenichi Matsumoto

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:33:34Z

**Summary**: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.

However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

### Probabilistic Aggregation and Targeted Embedding Optimization for   Collective Moral Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenchen Yuan, Zheyu Zhang, Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:21:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive moral reasoning abilities. Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust consensus and improves individual model fidelity. These findings highlight the value of data-driven moral alignment across multiple models and its potential for safer, more consistent AI systems.

### Causal inference amid missingness-specific independencies and mechanism   shifts
**Authors**: Johan de Aguas, Leonard Henckel, Johan Pensar, Guido Biele

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:14:32Z

**Summary**: The recovery of causal effects in structural models with missing data often relies on $m$-graphs, which assume that missingness mechanisms do not directly influence substantive variables. Yet, in many real-world settings, missing data can alter decision-making processes, as the absence of key information may affect downstream actions and states. To overcome this limitation, we introduce $lm$-SCMs and $lm$-graphs, which extend $m$-graphs by integrating a label set that represents relevant context-specific independencies (CSI), accounting for mechanism shifts induced by missingness. We define two causal effects within these systems: the Full Average Treatment Effect (FATE), which reflects the effect in a hypothetical scenario had no data been missing, and the Natural Average Treatment Effect (NATE), which captures the effect under the unaltered CSIs in the system. We propose recovery criteria for these queries and present doubly-robust estimators for a graphical model inspired by a real-world application. Simulations highlight key differences between these estimands and estimation methods. Findings from the application case suggest a small effect of ADHD treatment upon test achievement among Norwegian children, with a slight effect shift due to missing pre-tests scores.

### Semantic-Geometric-Physical-Driven Robot Manipulation Skill Transfer via   Skill Library and Tactile Representation
**Authors**: Mingchao Qi, Yuanjin Li, Xing Liu, Zhengxiong Liu, Panfeng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:10:59Z

**Summary**: Developing general robotic systems capable of manipulating in unstructured environments is a significant challenge, particularly as the tasks involved are typically long-horizon and rich-contact, requiring efficient skill transfer across different task scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose knowledge graph-based skill library construction method. This method hierarchically organizes manipulation knowledge using "task graph" and "scene graph" to represent task-specific and scene-specific information, respectively. Additionally, we introduce "state graph" to facilitate the interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Building upon this foundation, we further propose a novel hierarchical skill transfer framework based on the skill library and tactile representation, which integrates high-level reasoning for skill transfer and low-level precision for execution. At the task level, we utilize large language models (LLMs) and combine contextual learning with a four-stage chain-of-thought prompting paradigm to achieve subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, we develop an adaptive trajectory transfer method based on the skill library and the heuristic path planning algorithm. At the physical level, we propose an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile representation. This method dynamically acquires high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile images, adjusting parameters such as contact position and posture to ensure the effectiveness of transferred skills in new environments. Experiments demonstrate the skill transfer and adaptability capabilities of the proposed methods across different task scenarios. Project website: https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer

### FrontendBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Front-End Development   via Automatic Evaluation
**Authors**: Hongda Zhu, Yiwen Zhang, Bing Zhao, Jingzhe Ding, Siyao Liu, Tong Liu, Dandan Wang, Yanan Liu, Zhaojian Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:10:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks exhibit several critical limitations: many tasks are overly simplistic, test cases often lack rigor, and end-to-end validation is absent. These issues hinder the accurate assessment of model performance. To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks. These results highlight FrontendBench as a reliable and scalable benchmark, supporting consistent multimodal evaluation and providing a robust foundation for future research in front-end code generation. Our data and code will be released soon.

### Machine Learners Should Acknowledge the Legal Implications of Large   Language Models as Personal Data
**Authors**: Henrik Nolte, Michèle Finck, Kristof Meding

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:02:48Z

**Summary**: Does GPT know you? The answer depends on your level of public recognition; however, if your information was available on a website, the answer could be yes. Most Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent. Thus, even when an LLM memorizes only a small amount of personal data, it typically falls within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching. The LLM is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form. (2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own. This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights extend to the information embedded within the AI model. (3.) This paper argues that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data collection and curation to model provision on e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face. (4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs. Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain and the ML community.

### Parameter Inference in Non-linear Dynamical Systems via Recurrence Plots   and Convolutional Neural Networks
**Authors**: L. Lober, M. S. Palmero, F. A. Rodrigues

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:02:06Z

**Summary**: Inferring control parameters in non-linear dynamical systems is an important task in analysing general dynamical behaviours, particularly in the presence of inherently deterministic chaos. Traditional approaches often rely on system-specific models and involve heavily parametrised formulations, which can limit their general applicability. In this study, we present a methodology that employs recurrence plots as structured representations of non-linear trajectories, which are then used to train convolutional neural networks to infer the values of the control parameter associated with the analysed trajectories. We focus on two representative non-linear systems, namely the logistic map and the standard map, and show that our approach enables accurate estimation of the parameters governing their dynamics. When compared to regression models trained directly on raw time-series data, the use of recurrence plots yields significantly more robust results. Although the methodology does not aim to predict future states explicitly, we argue that accurate parameter inference, when combined with predetermined initial conditions, enables the reconstruction of a system's evolution due to its deterministic nature. These findings highlight the potential of recurrence-based learning frameworks for the automated identification and characterisation of non-linear dynamical behaviours.

### Targeted Lexical Injection: Unlocking Latent Cross-Lingual Alignment in   Lugha-Llama via Early-Layer LoRA Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Stanley Ngugi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:35:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

### Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under   Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference
**Authors**: Rongke Liu, Youwen Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T13:19:29Z

**Summary**: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow layer protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is how to partition the edge cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while minimizing accuracy degradation. We firest overturn the common belief that increasing model depth can resist MIA. Through theoretical analysis, we show that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, intra class mean squared radius ($R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality being critical factors. Experiments on three representative deep vision models show that partitioning at the representational transition or decision level layers yields over 4 times higher mean square error compared to shallow splits, indicating significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization. We also validate the resilience of decision level features under feature and inversion model enhancements, and observe that auxiliary data types influence both transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.

### The Effect of the Gotthard Base Tunnel on Road Traffic: A Synthetic   Control Approach
**Authors**: Hannes Wallimann, Widar von Arx, Ann Hesse

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:25:15Z

**Summary**: The opening of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2017, the longest railway tunnel in the world, marked a milestone in Swiss transport policy. The tunnel, a part of the New Rail Link through the Alps, serves as a key instrument of the so-called "modal shift policy," which aims to transfer transalpine freight traffic from road to rail. The reduction in travel time by train between northern and southern Switzerland raised expectations that a substantial share of tourist-oriented passenger traffic would also shift from car to rail. In this paper, we conduct a causal analysis of the impact of the Gotthard Base Tunnel's opening at the end of 2016 on the number of cars using the parallel Gotthard motorway section in the subsequent years. To this end, we apply the synthetic control and the synthetic difference-in-differences methods to construct a synthetic Gotthard motorway section based on a weighted combination of other alpine road crossings (a so-called donor pool) that did not experience the construction of a competing rail infrastructure. Our results reveal only a modest but statistically significant decline in the number of cars between the actual and the synthetic Gotthard motorway in the short run. Given the consistently strong and increasing demand for the new rail connection through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, we infer a substantial induced short-run demand effect resulting from the rail travel time savings.

### On Zero-Initialized Attention: Optimal Prompt and Gating Factor   Estimation
**Authors**: Nghiem T. Diep, Huy Nguyen, Chau Nguyen, Minh Le, Duy M. H. Nguyen, Daniel Sonntag, Mathias Niepert, Nhat Ho

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:24:26Z

**Summary**: The LLaMA-Adapter has recently emerged as an efficient fine-tuning technique for LLaMA models, leveraging zero-initialized attention to stabilize training and enhance performance. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing a connection between zero-initialized attention and mixture-of-expert models. We prove that both linear and non-linear prompts, along with gating functions, can be optimally estimated, with non-linear prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications. Empirically, we validate our findings on the open LLM benchmarks, demonstrating that non-linear prompts outperform linear ones. Notably, even with limited training data, both prompt types consistently surpass vanilla attention, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of zero-initialized attention.

### PsychBench: A comprehensive and professional benchmark for evaluating   the performance of LLM-assisted psychiatric clinical practice
**Authors**: Shuyu Liu, Ruoxi Wang, Ling Zhang, Xuequan Zhu, Rui Yang, Xinzhu Zhou, Fei Wu, Zhi Yang, Cheng Jin, Gang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:24:25Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance. Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement. Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.

### PEDANTIC: A Dataset for the Automatic Examination of Definiteness in   Patent Claims
**Authors**: Valentin Knappich, Annemarie Friedrich, Anna Hätty, Simon Razniewski

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:03:10Z

**Summary**: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

### SANSKRITI: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models'   Knowledge of Indian Culture
**Authors**: Arijit Maji, Raghvendra Kumar, Akash Ghosh, Anushka, Sriparna Saha

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T11:19:25Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

### MAD-MAX: Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures for Automated LLM   Red Teaming
**Authors**: Stefan Schoepf, Muhammad Zaid Hameed, Ambrish Rawat, Kieran Fraser, Giulio Zizzo, Giandomenico Cornacchia, Mark Purcell

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T11:04:21Z

**Summary**: With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3.   WARNING: This paper contains contents which are offensive in nature.

### Enhancing One-run Privacy Auditing with Quantile Regression-Based   Membership Inference
**Authors**: Terrance Liu, Matteo Boglioni, Yiwei Fu, Shengyuan Hu, Pratiksha Thaker, Zhiwei Steven Wu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T11:03:39Z

**Summary**: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

### Acoustic Waveform Inversion with Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridges
**Authors**: A. S. Stankevich, I. B. Petrov

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:55:26Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge ($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository https://github.com/stankevich-mipt/seismic_inversion_via_I2SB.

### DeVisE: Behavioral Testing of Medical Large Language Models
**Authors**: Camila Zurdo Tagliabue, Heloisa Oss Boll, Aykut Erdem, Erkut Erdem, Iacer Calixto

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:42:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

### GreekBarBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Free-Text Legal Reasoning and   Citations
**Authors**: Odysseas S. Chlapanis, Dimitrios Galanis, Nikolaos Aletras, Ion Androutsopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:12:11Z

**Summary**: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal questions across five different legal areas from the Greek Bar exams, requiring citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations, revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the 95th percentile of experts.

### Universal Laboratory Model: prognosis of abnormal clinical outcomes   based on routine tests
**Authors**: Pavel Karpov, Ilya Petrenkov, Ruslan Raiman

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:10:02Z

**Summary**: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910 NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

### SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Justus Westerhoff, Erblina Purelku, Jakob Hackstein, Jonas Loos, Leo Pinetzki, Lorenz Hufe

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:02:15Z

**Summary**: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.

### When and How Unlabeled Data Provably Improve In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Yingcong Li, Xiangyu Chang, Muti Kara, Xiaofeng Liu, Amit Roy-Chowdhury, Samet Oymak

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:01:17Z

**Summary**: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

### AIn't Nothing But a Survey? Using Large Language Models for Coding   German Open-Ended Survey Responses on Survey Motivation
**Authors**: Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Bernd Weiß, Jessica Daikeler

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:56:49Z

**Summary**: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

### The Avengers: A Simple Recipe for Uniting Smaller Language Models to   Challenge Proprietary Giants
**Authors**: Yiqun Zhang, Hao Li, Chenxu Wang, Linyao Chen, Qiaosheng Zhang, Peng Ye, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Zhen Wang, Xinrun Wang, Jia Xu, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Shuyue Hu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:47:20Z

**Summary**: Proprietary giants are increasingly dominating the race for ever-larger language models. Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.

### VideoMAR: Autoregressive Video Generatio with Continuous Tokens
**Authors**: Hu Yu, Biao Gong, Hangjie Yuan, DanDan Zheng, Weilong Chai, Jingdong Chen, Kecheng Zheng, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:44:09Z

**Summary**: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

### One-shot Face Sketch Synthesis in the Wild via Generative Diffusion   Prior and Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Han Wu, Junyao Li, Kangbo Zhao, Sen Zhang, Yukai Shi, Liang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:41:30Z

**Summary**: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch

### SecFwT: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning of Large Language   Models Using Forward-Only Passes
**Authors**: Jinglong Luo, Zhuo Zhang, Yehong Zhang, Shiyu Liu, Ye Dong, Xun Zhou, Hui Wang, Yue Yu, Zenglin Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:36:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

### ConLID: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Low-Resource Language   Identification
**Authors**: Negar Foroutan, Jakhongir Saydaliev, Ye Eun Kim, Antoine Bosselut

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:35:33Z

**Summary**: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

### Cohort Discovery: A Survey on LLM-Assisted Clinical Trial Recruitment
**Authors**: Shrestha Ghosh, Moritz Schneider, Carina Reinicke, Carsten Eickhoff

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:32:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

### LLM-as-BT-Planner: Leveraging LLMs for Behavior Tree Generation in Robot   Task Planning
**Authors**: Jicong Ao, Fan Wu, Yansong Wu, Abdalla Swikir, Sami Haddadin

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:29:17Z

**Summary**: Robotic assembly tasks remain an open challenge due to their long horizon nature and complex part relations. Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

### DOVA-PATBM: An Intelligent, Adaptive, and Scalable Framework for   Optimizing Large-Scale EV Charging Infrastructure
**Authors**: Chuan Li, Shunyu Zhao, Vincent Gauthier, Hassine Moungla

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:15:18Z

**Summary**: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.   We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.   Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

### AI-driven visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks
**Authors**: Mattia Nardon, Stefano Messelodi, Antonio Granata, Fabio Poiesi, Alberto Danese, Davide Boscaini

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:08:42Z

**Summary**: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT, a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by partial and uncertain visual observations.

### Unlocking Post-hoc Dataset Inference with Synthetic Data
**Authors**: Bihe Zhao, Pratyush Maini, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:46:59Z

**Summary**: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

### Trust Region Preference Approximation: A simple and stable reinforcement   learning algorithm for LLM reasoning
**Authors**: Xuerui Su, Shufang Xie, Guoqing Liu, Yingce Xia, Renqian Luo, Peiran Jin, Zhiming Ma, Yue Wang, Zun Wang, Yuting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:39:46Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability. The code of this paper are released and updating on https://github.com/XueruiSu/Trust-Region-Preference-Approximation.git.

### Large Language Models for Automated Literature Review: An Evaluation of   Reference Generation, Abstract Writing, and Review Composition
**Authors**: Xuemei Tang, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:37:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to automate the complex processes involved in writing literature reviews, such as literature collection, organization, and summarization. However, it is yet unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress. Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings highlight the need for further research and development to improve the reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.

### Privacy-Preserving Chest X-ray Classification in Latent Space with   Homomorphically Encrypted Neural Inference
**Authors**: Jonghun Kim, Gyeongdeok Jo, Shinyoung Ra, Hyunjin Park

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:35:50Z

**Summary**: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

### RAS-Eval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Security Evaluation of LLM   Agents in Real-World Environments
**Authors**: Yuchuan Fu, Xiaohan Yuan, Dongxia Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:30:36Z

**Summary**: The rapid deployment of Large language model (LLM) agents in critical domains like healthcare and finance necessitates robust security frameworks. To address the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks for these agents in dynamic environments, we introduce RAS-Eval, a comprehensive security benchmark supporting both simulated and real-world tool execution. RAS-Eval comprises 80 test cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities, with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose critical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational framework for future security research. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lanzer-tree/RAS-Eval.

### Singular Value Decomposition on Kronecker Adaptation for Large Language   Model
**Authors**: Yee Hin Chong, Peng Qu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:28:53Z

**Summary**: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence (randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).   We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.   Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.

**Authors**: Juli Bakagianni, John Pavlopoulos, Aristidis Likas

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:24:27Z

**Summary**: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

### Retrospective Memory for Camouflaged Object Detection
**Authors**: Chenxi Zhang, Jiayun Wu, Qing Zhang, Yazhe Zhai, Youwei Pang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:22:19Z

**Summary**: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Lost in Variation? Evaluating NLI Performance in Basque and Spanish   Geographical Variants
**Authors**: Jaione Bengoetxea, Itziar Gonzalez-Dios, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:20:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

### Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent LLM Strategies for Automated Student   Reflection Assessment
**Authors**: Gen Li, Li Chen, Cheng Tang, Valdemar Švábenský, Daisuke Deguchi, Takayoshi Yamashita, Atsushi Shimada

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:17:16Z

**Summary**: We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

### Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30   Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud
**Authors**: Z. Keszthelyi, S. A. Brands, A. de Koter, N. Langer, J. Puls

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:13:58Z

**Summary**: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]

### Large Language Models for Unit Testing: A Systematic Literature Review
**Authors**: Quanjun Zhang, Chunrong Fang, Siqi Gu, Ye Shang, Zhenyu Chen, Liang Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:11:10Z

**Summary**: Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software engineering, with the aim of ensuring the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of individual software components. Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities. This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research. Our artifacts are publicly available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/iSEngLab/AwesomeLLM4UT.

 ### PhantomHunter: Detecting Unseen Privately-Tuned LLM-Generated Text via   Family-Aware Learning
**Authors**: Yuhui Shi, Yehan Yang, Qiang Sheng, Hao Mi, Beizhe Hu, Chaoxi Xu, Juan Cao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

### GenRecal: Generation after Recalibration from Large to Small   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Byung-Kwan Lee, Ryo Hachiuma, Yong Man Ro, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Yueh-Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

### Near-Field SWIPT with gMIMO in the Upper Mid-Band: Opportunities,   Challenges, and the Way Forward
**Authors**: Özlem Tugfe Demir, Mustafa Ozger, Ferdi Kara, Woong-Hee Lee, Emil Björnson

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:51:19Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO) technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral efficiency through beamfocusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper discusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions, including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and dynamic environments. These findings contribute to advancing energy-autonomous Internet-of-Everything (IoE) deployments, smart factory networks, and other energy-autonomous applications aligned with the goals of next-generation wireless technologies.

### CC-LEARN: Cohort-based Consistency Learning
**Authors**: Xiao Ye, Shaswat Shrivastava, Zhaonan Li, Jacob Dineen, Shijie Lu, Avneet Ahuja, Ming Shen, Zhikun Xu, Ben Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:41:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

### PhishDebate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Phishing Website   Detection
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Selvakumar Manickam, Yung-wey Chong, Shankar Karuppayah

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:33:18Z

**Summary**: Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application requirements.

### deepSURF: Detecting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Rust Through   Fuzzing LLM-Augmented Harnesses
**Authors**: Georgios Androutsopoulos, Antonio Bianchi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:18:23Z

**Summary**: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.   To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

### Aug2Search: Enhancing Facebook Marketplace Search with LLM-Generated   Synthetic Data Augmentation
**Authors**: Ruijie Xi, He Ba, Hao Yuan, Rishu Agrawal, Yuxin Tian, Ruoyan Long, Arul Prakash

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:04:04Z

**Summary**: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results. However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models. We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3) generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original and synthetic data.

### Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language   Models Considering Instruction Following Ability
**Authors**: Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:00:54Z

**Summary**: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

### J4R: Learning to Judge with Equivalent Initial State Group Relative   Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Austin Xu, Yilun Zhou, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:58:25Z

**Summary**: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM) development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains, like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning (RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3) We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and ReasoningJudgeBench.

### The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic   Routing Games
**Authors**: Lyle Goodyear, Rachel Guo, Ramesh Johari

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:53:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).   We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

### Router-R1: Teaching LLMs Multi-Round Routing and Aggregation via   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Haozhen Zhang, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:49:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

### BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via   Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion
**Authors**: Yuqing Lan, Chenyang Zhu, Zhirui Gao, Jiazhao Zhang, Yihan Cao, Renjiao Yi, Yijie Wang, Kai Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:40:05Z

**Summary**: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

### LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Gabrel J. Perin, Runjin Chen, Xuxi Chen, Nina S. T. Hirata, Zhangyang Wang, Junyuan Hong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:30:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

### LiteGD: Lightweight and dynamic GPU Dispatching for Large-scale   Heterogeneous Clusters
**Authors**: Kunming Zhang, Hanlong Liao, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:10:17Z

**Summary**: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity. However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step, which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy (approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale heterogeneous environments.

**Authors**: Huaiyuan Ying, Zijian Wu, Yihan Geng, Zheng Yuan, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:07:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, especially in solving mathematical problems. However, large language models are not good at math theorem proving using formal languages like Lean. A significant challenge in this area is the scarcity of training data available in these formal languages. To address this issue, we propose a novel pipeline that iteratively generates and filters synthetic data to translate natural language mathematical problems into Lean 4 statements, and vice versa. Our results indicate that the synthetic data pipeline can provide useful training data and improve the performance of LLMs in translating and understanding complex mathematical problems and proofs. Our final dataset contains about 57K formal-informal question pairs along with searched proof from the math contest forum and 21 new IMO questions. We open-source our code at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and our data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternLM/Lean-Workbook.

### "Generate" the Future of Work through AI: Empirical Evidence from Online   Labor Markets
**Authors**: Jin Liu, Xingchen Xu, Xi Nan, Yongjun Li, Yong Tan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:05:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate zero-shot learning capabilities across a wide range of downstream tasks. Owing to their general-purpose nature and potential to augment or even automate job functions, these systems are poised to reshape labor market dynamics. However, predicting their precise impact \textit{a priori} is challenging, given AI's simultaneous effects on both demand and supply, as well as the strategic responses of market participants. Leveraging an extensive dataset from a leading online labor platform, we document a pronounced displacement effect and an overall contraction in submarkets where required skills closely align with core LLM functionalities. Although demand and supply both decline, the reduction in supply is comparatively smaller, thereby intensifying competition among freelancers. Notably, further analysis shows that this heightened competition is especially pronounced in programming-intensive submarkets. This pattern is attributed to skill-transition effects: by lowering the human-capital barrier to programming, ChatGPT enables incumbent freelancers to enter programming tasks. Moreover, these transitions are not homogeneous, with high-skilled freelancers contributing disproportionately to the shift. Our findings illuminate the multifaceted impacts of general-purpose AI on labor markets, highlighting not only the displacement of certain occupations but also the inducement of skill transitions within the labor supply. These insights offer practical implications for policymakers, platform operators, and workers.

### A Unified Graph-based Framework for Scalable 3D Tree Reconstruction and   Non-Destructive Biomass Estimation from Point Clouds
**Authors**: Di Wang, Shi Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:55:47Z

**Summary**: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI): A Multilevel Framework for   Evaluating Gender Diversity in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengyang Shan, Emily Ruth Diana, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:43:16Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

### Managing Complex Failure Analysis Workflows with LLM-based Reasoning and   Acting Agents
**Authors**: Aline Dobrovsky, Konstantin Schekotihin, Christian Burmer

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:43:10Z

**Summary**: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.   This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### Fractured Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Baohao Liao, Hanze Dong, Yuhui Xu, Doyen Sahoo, Christof Monz, Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:41:14Z

**Summary**: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/frac-cot.

**Authors**: Syed Haider Ali, Asrar Ahmad, Muhammad Ali, Asifullah Khan, Muhammad Shahban, Nadeem Shaukat

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:36:37Z

**Summary**: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

### RaCalNet: Radar Calibration Network for Sparse-Supervised Metric Depth   Estimation
**Authors**: Xingrui Qin, Wentao Zhao, Chuan Cao, Yihe Niu, Houcheng Jiang, Jingchuan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:35:16Z

**Summary**: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

### Towards Explainable Indoor Localization: Interpreting Neural Network   Learning on Wi-Fi Fingerprints Using Logic Gates
**Authors**: Danish Gufran, Sudeep Pasricha

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:34:41Z

**Summary**: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.

### PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through   Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction
**Authors**: Shufan Li, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:29:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

### DAILOC: Domain-Incremental Learning for Indoor Localization using   Smartphones
**Authors**: Akhil Singampalli, Danish Gufran, Sudeep Pasricha

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:27:40Z

**Summary**: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time. Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

### DAGs for the Masses
**Authors**: Michael Anoprenko, Andrei Tonkikh, Alexander Spiegelman, Petr Kuznetsov

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:16:15Z

**Summary**: A recent approach to building consensus protocols on top of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) shows much promise due to its simplicity and stable throughput. However, as each node in the DAG typically includes a linear number of references to the nodes in the previous round, prior DAG protocols only scale up to a certain point when the overhead of maintaining the graph becomes the bottleneck.   To enable large-scale deployments of DAG-based protocols, we propose a sparse DAG architecture, where each node includes only a constant number of references to random nodes in the previous round. We present a sparse version of Bullshark -- one of the most prominent DAG-based consensus protocols -- and demonstrate its improved scalability.   Remarkably, unlike other protocols that use random sampling to reduce communication complexity, we manage to avoid sacrificing resilience: the protocol can tolerate up to $f<n/3$ Byzantine faults (where $n$ is the number of participants), same as its less scalable deterministic counterpart. The proposed ``sparse'' methodology can be applied to any protocol that maintains disseminated system updates and causal relations between them in a graph-like structure. Our simulations show that the considerable reduction of transmitted metadata in sparse DAGs results in more efficient network utilization and better scalability.

### Pap2Pat: Benchmarking Outline-Guided Long-Text Patent Generation with   Patent-Paper Pairs
**Authors**: Valentin Knappich, Simon Razniewski, Anna Hätty, Annemarie Friedrich

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:08:29Z

**Summary**: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.

### Lessons from Training Grounded LLMs with Verifiable Rewards
**Authors**: Shang Hong Sim, Tej Deep Pala, Vernon Toh, Hai Leong Chieu, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:58:13Z

**Summary**: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

**Authors**: Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mahshad Lotfinia, Keno Bressem, Robert Siepmann, Lisa Adams, Dyke Ferber, Christiane Kuhl, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Sven Nebelung, Daniel Truhn

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:52:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. RadioRAG shows potential to improve LLM accuracy and factuality in radiology question answering by integrating real-time domain-specific data.

### RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Le Vu Anh, Nguyen Viet Anh, Mehmet Dik, Luong Van Nghia

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:48:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

### Optimizing Web-Based AI Query Retrieval with GPT Integration in   LangChain A CoT-Enhanced Prompt Engineering Approach
**Authors**: Wenqi Guan, Yang Fang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:47:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

### SPARE: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation for   Automatic Process Supervision and Reward Modelling
**Authors**: Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:37:59Z

**Summary**: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

### Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA: A Bi-Phase Adversarial CAPTCHA Framework
**Authors**: Xia Du, Xiaoyuan Liu, Jizhe Zhou, Zheng Lin, Chi-man Pun, Cong Wu, Tao Li, Zhe Chen, Wei Ni, Jun Luo

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:20:09Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

### Context-Informed Grounding Supervision
**Authors**: Hyunji Lee, Seunghyun Yoon, Yunjae Won, Hanseok Oh, Geewook Kim, Trung Bui, Franck Dernoncourt, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Minjoon Seo

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:13:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

### Position Paper: Rethinking Privacy in RL for Sequential Decision-making   in the Age of LLMs
**Authors**: Flint Xiaofeng Fan, Cheston Tan, Roger Wattenhofer, Yew-Soon Ong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:10:39Z

**Summary**: The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

### Multimodal Large Language Models for Medical Report Generation via   Customized Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Chunlei Li, Jingyang Hou, Yilei Shi, Jingliang Hu, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Lichao Mou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:09:34Z

**Summary**: Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in clinical practice. While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging data still deserves in-depth exploration. In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization mechanism. Our key innovation lies in generating instance-specific prompts tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine transformations derived from visual features. We propose two implementations: prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted report generation. Extensive experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical report generation. Our code will be made publicly available.

### Analyzing URA Geometry for Enhanced Spatial Multiplexing and Extended   Near-Field Coverage
**Authors**: Ahmed Hussain, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T14:01:34Z

**Summary**: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.

### All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints
**Authors**: Nikolay Blagoev, Oğuzhan Ersoy, Lydia Yiyu Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:48:33Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

### RE-IMAGINE: Symbolic Benchmark Synthesis for Reasoning Evaluation
**Authors**: Xinnuo Xu, Rachel Lawrence, Kshitij Dubey, Atharva Pandey, Risa Ueno, Fabian Falck, Aditya V. Nori, Rahul Sharma, Amit Sharma, Javier Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:35:47Z

**Summary**: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

### Uncovering Intention through LLM-Driven Code Snippet Description   Generation
**Authors**: Yusuf Sulistyo Nugroho, Farah Danisha Salam, Brittany Reid, Raula Gaikovina Kula, Kazumasa Shimari, Kenichi Matsumoto

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:33:34Z

**Summary**: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.

**Authors**: Zhouhong Gu, Xiaoxuan Zhu, Yin Cai, Hao Shen, Xingzhou Chen, Qingyi Wang, Jialin Li, Xiaoran Shi, Haoran Guo, Wenxuan Huang, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao, Zheyu Ye, Yao Hu, Shaosheng Cao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:24:04Z

**Summary**: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/MikeGu721/AgentGroupChat-V2.

### Probabilistic Aggregation and Targeted Embedding Optimization for   Collective Moral Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenchen Yuan, Zheyu Zhang, Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:21:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive moral reasoning abilities. Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust consensus and improves individual model fidelity. These findings highlight the value of data-driven moral alignment across multiple models and its potential for safer, more consistent AI systems.

**Summary**: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) is a passionate field that has significantly accelerated the creation of 3D models in gaming, film, and design. Despite the development of several groundbreaking models that have revolutionized 3D generation, the field remains largely accessible only to researchers, developers, and designers due to the complexities involved in collecting, processing, and training 3D models. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan3D 2.1 as a case study in this tutorial. This tutorial offers a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on processing 3D data, training a 3D generative model, and evaluating its performance using Hunyuan3D 2.1, an advanced system for producing high-resolution, textured 3D assets. The system comprises two core components: the Hunyuan3D-DiT for shape generation and the Hunyuan3D-Paint for texture synthesis. We will explore the entire workflow, including data preparation, model architecture, training strategies, evaluation metrics, and deployment. By the conclusion of this tutorial, you will have the knowledge to finetune or develop a robust 3D generative model suitable for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and industrial design.

### Semantic-Geometric-Physical-Driven Robot Manipulation Skill Transfer via   Skill Library and Tactile Representation
**Authors**: Mingchao Qi, Yuanjin Li, Xing Liu, Zhengxiong Liu, Panfeng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:10:59Z

**Summary**: Developing general robotic systems capable of manipulating in unstructured environments is a significant challenge, particularly as the tasks involved are typically long-horizon and rich-contact, requiring efficient skill transfer across different task scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose knowledge graph-based skill library construction method. This method hierarchically organizes manipulation knowledge using "task graph" and "scene graph" to represent task-specific and scene-specific information, respectively. Additionally, we introduce "state graph" to facilitate the interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Building upon this foundation, we further propose a novel hierarchical skill transfer framework based on the skill library and tactile representation, which integrates high-level reasoning for skill transfer and low-level precision for execution. At the task level, we utilize large language models (LLMs) and combine contextual learning with a four-stage chain-of-thought prompting paradigm to achieve subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, we develop an adaptive trajectory transfer method based on the skill library and the heuristic path planning algorithm. At the physical level, we propose an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile representation. This method dynamically acquires high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile images, adjusting parameters such as contact position and posture to ensure the effectiveness of transferred skills in new environments. Experiments demonstrate the skill transfer and adaptability capabilities of the proposed methods across different task scenarios. Project website: https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer

### FrontendBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Front-End Development   via Automatic Evaluation
**Authors**: Hongda Zhu, Yiwen Zhang, Bing Zhao, Jingzhe Ding, Siyao Liu, Tong Liu, Dandan Wang, Yanan Liu, Zhaojian Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:10:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks exhibit several critical limitations: many tasks are overly simplistic, test cases often lack rigor, and end-to-end validation is absent. These issues hinder the accurate assessment of model performance. To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks. These results highlight FrontendBench as a reliable and scalable benchmark, supporting consistent multimodal evaluation and providing a robust foundation for future research in front-end code generation. Our data and code will be released soon.

### Side-Channel Extraction of Dataflow AI Accelerator Hardware Parameters
**Authors**: Guillaume Lomet, Ruben Salvador, Brice Colombier, Vincent Grosso, Olivier Sentieys, Cedric Killian

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:06:09Z

**Summary**: Dataflow neural network accelerators efficiently process AI tasks on FPGAs, with deployment simplified by ready-to-use frameworks and pre-trained models. However, this convenience makes them vulnerable to malicious actors seeking to reverse engineer valuable Intellectual Property (IP) through Side-Channel Attacks (SCA). This paper proposes a methodology to recover the hardware configuration of dataflow accelerators generated with the FINN framework. Through unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we reduce the computational overhead compared to the state-of-the-art, enabling lightweight classifiers to recover both folding and quantization parameters. We demonstrate an attack phase requiring only 337 ms to recover the hardware parameters with an accuracy of more than 95% and 421 ms to fully recover these parameters with an averaging of 4 traces for a FINN-based accelerator running a CNN, both using a random forest classifier on side-channel traces, even with the accelerator dataflow fully loaded. This approach offers a more realistic attack scenario than existing methods, and compared to SoA attacks based on tsfresh, our method requires 940x and 110x less time for preparation and attack phases, respectively, and gives better results even without averaging traces.

### Machine Learners Should Acknowledge the Legal Implications of Large   Language Models as Personal Data
**Authors**: Henrik Nolte, Michèle Finck, Kristof Meding

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T13:02:48Z

**Summary**: Does GPT know you? The answer depends on your level of public recognition; however, if your information was available on a website, the answer could be yes. Most Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent. Thus, even when an LLM memorizes only a small amount of personal data, it typically falls within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching. The LLM is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form. (2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own. This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights extend to the information embedded within the AI model. (3.) This paper argues that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data collection and curation to model provision on e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face. (4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs. Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain and the ML community.

### Rasterizing Wireless Radiance Field via Deformable 2D Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Mufan Liu, Cixiao Zhang, Qi Yang, Yujie Cao, Yiling Xu, Yin Xu, Shu Sun, Mingzeng Dai, Yunfeng Guan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:41:12Z

**Summary**: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its signal quality.

### Targeted Lexical Injection: Unlocking Latent Cross-Lingual Alignment in   Lugha-Llama via Early-Layer LoRA Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Stanley Ngugi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:35:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

### On Zero-Initialized Attention: Optimal Prompt and Gating Factor   Estimation
**Authors**: Nghiem T. Diep, Huy Nguyen, Chau Nguyen, Minh Le, Duy M. H. Nguyen, Daniel Sonntag, Mathias Niepert, Nhat Ho

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:24:26Z

**Summary**: The LLaMA-Adapter has recently emerged as an efficient fine-tuning technique for LLaMA models, leveraging zero-initialized attention to stabilize training and enhance performance. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing a connection between zero-initialized attention and mixture-of-expert models. We prove that both linear and non-linear prompts, along with gating functions, can be optimally estimated, with non-linear prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications. Empirically, we validate our findings on the open LLM benchmarks, demonstrating that non-linear prompts outperform linear ones. Notably, even with limited training data, both prompt types consistently surpass vanilla attention, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of zero-initialized attention.

### PsychBench: A comprehensive and professional benchmark for evaluating   the performance of LLM-assisted psychiatric clinical practice
**Authors**: Shuyu Liu, Ruoxi Wang, Ling Zhang, Xuequan Zhu, Rui Yang, Xinzhu Zhou, Fei Wu, Zhi Yang, Cheng Jin, Gang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:24:25Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance. Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement. Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.

### PEDANTIC: A Dataset for the Automatic Examination of Definiteness in   Patent Claims
**Authors**: Valentin Knappich, Annemarie Friedrich, Anna Hätty, Simon Razniewski

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T12:03:10Z

**Summary**: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

### Brain Stroke Classification Using Wavelet Transform and MLP Neural   Networks on DWI MRI Images
**Authors**: Mana Mohammadi, Amirhesam Jafari Rad, Ashkan Behrouzi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T11:33:58Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a lightweight framework for classifying brain stroke types from Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) MRI scans, employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with Wavelet Transform for feature extraction. Accurate and timely stroke detection is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes in neuroimaging. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for medical image analysis, their computational complexity often hinders deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. In contrast, our approach combines Wavelet Transform with a compact MLP to achieve efficient and accurate stroke classification. Using the "Brain Stroke MRI Images" dataset, our method yields classification accuracies of 82.0% with the "db4" wavelet (level 3 decomposition) and 86.00% with the "Haar" wavelet (level 2 decomposition). This analysis highlights a balance between diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for automated stroke diagnosis. Future research will focus on enhancing model robustness and integrating additional MRI modalities for comprehensive stroke assessment.

**Authors**: Arijit Maji, Raghvendra Kumar, Akash Ghosh, Anushka, Sriparna Saha

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T11:19:25Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

### MAD-MAX: Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures for Automated LLM   Red Teaming
**Authors**: Stefan Schoepf, Muhammad Zaid Hameed, Ambrish Rawat, Kieran Fraser, Giulio Zizzo, Giandomenico Cornacchia, Mark Purcell

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T11:04:21Z

**Summary**: With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3.   WARNING: This paper contains contents which are offensive in nature.

### Agile Orchestration at Will: An Entire Smart Service-Based Security   Architecture Towards 6G
**Authors**: Zhuoran Duan, Guoshun Nan, Rushan Li, Zijun Wang, Lihua Xiong, Chaoying Yuan, Guorong Liu, Hui Xu, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:53:35Z

**Summary**: The upcoming 6G will fundamentally reshape mobile networks beyond communications, unlocking a multitude of applications that were once considered unimaginable. Meanwhile, security and resilience are especially highlighted in the 6G design principles. However, safeguarding 6G networks will be quite challenging due to various known and unknown threats from highly heterogeneous networks and diversified security requirements of distinct use cases, calling for a comprehensive re-design of security architecture. This motivates us to propose ES3A (Entire Smart Service-based Security Architecture), a novel security architecture for 6G networks. Specifically, we first discuss six high-level principles of our ES3A that include hierarchy, flexibility, scalability, resilience, endogeny, and trust and privacy. With these goals in mind, we then introduce three guidelines from a deployment perspective, envisioning our ES3A that offers service-based security, end-to-end protection, and smart security automation for 6G networks. Our architecture consists of three layers and three domains. It relies on a two-stage orchestration mechanism to tailor smart security strategies for customized protection in high-dynamic 6G networks, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. Finally, we prototype the proposed ES3A on a real-world radio system based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR). Experiments show the effectiveness of our ES3A. We also provide a case to show the superiority of our architecture.

### Offensive Robot Cybersecurity
**Authors**: Víctor Mayoral-Vilches

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:49:40Z

**Summary**: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

### DeVisE: Behavioral Testing of Medical Large Language Models
**Authors**: Camila Zurdo Tagliabue, Heloisa Oss Boll, Aykut Erdem, Erkut Erdem, Iacer Calixto

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:42:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

### Supervised Robustness-preserving Data-free Neural Network Pruning
**Authors**: Mark Huasong Meng, Guangdong Bai, Sin Gee Teo, Jin Song Dong

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:26:20Z

**Summary**: When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications, model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy.

### GreekBarBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Free-Text Legal Reasoning and   Citations
**Authors**: Odysseas S. Chlapanis, Dimitrios Galanis, Nikolaos Aletras, Ion Androutsopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:12:11Z

**Summary**: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal questions across five different legal areas from the Greek Bar exams, requiring citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations, revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the 95th percentile of experts.

### Universal Laboratory Model: prognosis of abnormal clinical outcomes   based on routine tests
**Authors**: Pavel Karpov, Ilya Petrenkov, Ruslan Raiman

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:10:02Z

**Summary**: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T12:27:10Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910 NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

### SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Justus Westerhoff, Erblina Purelku, Jakob Hackstein, Jonas Loos, Leo Pinetzki, Lorenz Hufe

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T10:02:15Z

**Summary**: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.

### AIn't Nothing But a Survey? Using Large Language Models for Coding   German Open-Ended Survey Responses on Survey Motivation
**Authors**: Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Bernd Weiß, Jessica Daikeler

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:56:49Z

**Summary**: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

### An Actionable Hierarchical Scene Representation Enhancing Autonomous   Inspection Missions in Unknown Environments
**Authors**: Vignesh Kottayam Viswanathan, Mario Alberto Valdes Saucedo, Sumeet Gajanan Satpute, Christoforos Kanellakis, George Nikolakopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:47:46Z

**Summary**: In this article, we present the Layered Semantic Graphs (LSG), a novel actionable hierarchical scene graph, fully integrated with a multi-modal mission planner, the FLIE: A First-Look based Inspection and Exploration planner. The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of maintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while simultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene understanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown targets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which could extend inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in urban outdoor environment settings.

### SecFwT: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning of Large Language   Models Using Forward-Only Passes
**Authors**: Jinglong Luo, Zhuo Zhang, Yehong Zhang, Shiyu Liu, Ye Dong, Xun Zhou, Hui Wang, Yue Yu, Zenglin Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:36:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

### ConLID: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Low-Resource Language   Identification
**Authors**: Negar Foroutan, Jakhongir Saydaliev, Ye Eun Kim, Antoine Bosselut

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:35:33Z

**Summary**: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

### Cohort Discovery: A Survey on LLM-Assisted Clinical Trial Recruitment
**Authors**: Shrestha Ghosh, Moritz Schneider, Carina Reinicke, Carsten Eickhoff

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:32:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

### LLM-as-BT-Planner: Leveraging LLMs for Behavior Tree Generation in Robot   Task Planning
**Authors**: Jicong Ao, Fan Wu, Yansong Wu, Abdalla Swikir, Sami Haddadin

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:29:17Z

**Summary**: Robotic assembly tasks remain an open challenge due to their long horizon nature and complex part relations. Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

### DOVA-PATBM: An Intelligent, Adaptive, and Scalable Framework for   Optimizing Large-Scale EV Charging Infrastructure
**Authors**: Chuan Li, Shunyu Zhao, Vincent Gauthier, Hassine Moungla

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:15:18Z

**Summary**: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.   We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.   Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

### Unlocking Post-hoc Dataset Inference with Synthetic Data
**Authors**: Bihe Zhao, Pratyush Maini, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:46:59Z

**Summary**: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

**Authors**: Xuerui Su, Shufang Xie, Guoqing Liu, Yingce Xia, Renqian Luo, Peiran Jin, Zhiming Ma, Yue Wang, Zun Wang, Yuting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:39:46Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability. The code of this paper are released and updating on https://github.com/XueruiSu/Trust-Region-Preference-Approximation.git.

### Large Language Models for Automated Literature Review: An Evaluation of   Reference Generation, Abstract Writing, and Review Composition
**Authors**: Xuemei Tang, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:37:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to automate the complex processes involved in writing literature reviews, such as literature collection, organization, and summarization. However, it is yet unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress. Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings highlight the need for further research and development to improve the reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.

**Authors**: Yuchuan Fu, Xiaohan Yuan, Dongxia Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:30:36Z

**Summary**: The rapid deployment of Large language model (LLM) agents in critical domains like healthcare and finance necessitates robust security frameworks. To address the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks for these agents in dynamic environments, we introduce RAS-Eval, a comprehensive security benchmark supporting both simulated and real-world tool execution. RAS-Eval comprises 80 test cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities, with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose critical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational framework for future security research. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lanzer-tree/RAS-Eval.

### TopClustRAG at SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge
**Authors**: Juli Bakagianni, John Pavlopoulos, Aristidis Likas

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:24:27Z

**Summary**: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

### Lost in Variation? Evaluating NLI Performance in Basque and Spanish   Geographical Variants
**Authors**: Jaione Bengoetxea, Itziar Gonzalez-Dios, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:20:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

### First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference   Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting   Layer Beams
**Authors**: Martin Dušek, Sebastian Figura, Jakub Michal Polak, Solomon William Kamugasa, Dirk Mergelkuhl, Witold Niewiem, Štěpán Kunc, Jean-Christophe Gayde, Miroslav Šulc

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:18:05Z

**Summary**: This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.

### Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent LLM Strategies for Automated Student   Reflection Assessment
**Authors**: Gen Li, Li Chen, Cheng Tang, Valdemar Švábenský, Daisuke Deguchi, Takayoshi Yamashita, Atsushi Shimada

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:17:16Z

**Summary**: We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

**Authors**: Quanjun Zhang, Chunrong Fang, Siqi Gu, Ye Shang, Zhenyu Chen, Liang Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:11:10Z

**Summary**: Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software engineering, with the aim of ensuring the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of individual software components. Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities. This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research. Our artifacts are publicly available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/iSEngLab/AwesomeLLM4UT.

### Improving LLM Video Understanding with 16 Frames Per Second
**Authors**: Yixuan Li, Changli Tang, Jimin Zhuang, Yudong Yang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:04:33Z

**Summary**: Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. We will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data at \href{https://github.com/bytedance/F-16}{https://github.com/bytedance/F-16}.

### Robust Utility-Preserving Text Anonymization Based on Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Tianyu Yang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T08:01:35Z

**Summary**: Anonymizing text that contains sensitive information is crucial for a wide range of applications. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of the re-identification ability of large language models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and reasoning over dispersed pieces of patterns to draw conclusions. When defending against LLM-based re-identification, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks. In general, the interaction between anonymization and data utility requires a deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework composed of three key LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks. We provide detailed studies on these core modules. To consider large-scale and real-time applications, we investigate the distillation of the anonymization capabilities into lightweight models. All of our code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2025-rupta.

### video-SALMONN 2: Captioning-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models
**Authors**: Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Yudong Yang, Jimin Zhuang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:58:41Z

**Summary**: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size. Codes are available at \href{https://github.com/bytedance/video-SALMONN-2}{https://github.com/bytedance/video-SALMONN-2}.

### MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored   Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs
**Authors**: Yongqi Fan, Yating Wang, Guandong Wang, Jie Zhai, Jingping Liu, Qi Ye, Tong Ruan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:49:13Z

**Summary**: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

**Authors**: Madjid G. Tehrani, Eldar Sultanow, William J. Buchanan, Mahkame Houmani, Christel H. Djaha Fodja

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:47:12Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have gained significant traction in diverse applications, including security vulnerability scanning. This paper investigates the efficacy of GPT-4 in identifying software vulnerabilities compared to traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. Drawing from an array of security mistakes, our analysis underscores the potent capabilities of GPT-4 in LLM-enhanced vulnerability scanning. We unveiled that GPT-4 (Advanced Data Analysis) outperforms SAST by an accuracy of 94% in detecting 32 types of exploitable vulnerabilities. This study also addresses the potential security concerns surrounding LLMs, emphasising the imperative of security by design/default and other security best practices for AI.

### ProtoReasoning: Prototypes as the Foundation for Generalizable Reasoning   in LLMs
**Authors**: Feng He, Zijun Chen, Xinnian Liang, Tingting Ma, Yunqi Qiu, Shuangzhi Wu, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:44:09Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

**Authors**: Andrea Cadeddu, Alessandro Chessa, Vincenzo De Leo, Gianni Fenu, Enrico Motta, Francesco Osborne, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Angelo Salatino, Luca Secchi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:42:32Z

**Summary**: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

### BIS Reasoning 1.0: The First Large-Scale Japanese Benchmark for   Belief-Inconsistent Syllogistic Reasoning
**Authors**: Ha-Thanh Nguyen, Chaoran Liu, Koichi Takeda, Yusuke Miyao, Pontus Stenetorp, Qianying Liu, Su Myat Noe, Hideyuki Tachibana, Sadao Kurohashi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:39:43Z

**Summary**: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and safety.

### A compact neuromorphic system for ultra-energy-efficient, on-device   robot localization
**Authors**: Adam D. Hines, Michael Milford, Tobias Fischer

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:26:44Z

**Summary**: Neuromorphic computing offers a transformative pathway to overcome the computational and energy challenges faced in deploying robotic localization and navigation systems at the edge. Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require accurate long-endurance localization. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity of bio-realistic networks. In order to overcome this challenge, fusion of hardware and algorithms is critical to employ this specialized computing paradigm. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs competitive place recognition in up to 8 kilometers of traversal using models as small as 180 kilobytes with 44,000 parameters, while consuming less than 8% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems (LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SynSense Speck chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. When compared to a benchmark place recognition method, Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD), LENS performs comparably in overall precision. LENS represents an accurate fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale, on-device deployment for energy efficient robotic place recognition. Neuromorphic computing enables resource-constrained robots to perform energy efficient, accurate localization.

### HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial   Optimization Challenges
**Authors**: Xianliang Yang, Ling Zhang, Haolong Qian, Lei Song, Jiang Bian

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:20:01Z

**Summary**: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/HeurAgenix.

### An efficient co-simulation and control approach to tackle complex   multi-domain energetic systems: concepts and applications of the PEGASE   platform
**Authors**: Mathieu Vallee, Roland Baviere, Valérie Seguin, Valéry Vuillerme, Nicolas Lamaison, Michael Nikhil Descamps, Antoine Aurousseau

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:19:50Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel research software, called PEGASE, suitable for the design, validation and deployment of advanced control strategies for complex multi-domain energy systems. PEGASE especially features a highly efficient cosimulation engine, together with integrated solutions for defining both rule-based control strategies and Model-Predictive Control (MPC). The main principle behind the PEGASE platform is divide-and-conquer. Indeed, rather than trying to solve a problem as a monolithic entity, which can be highly complex for multi-domain large-scale systems, it is often more efficient to decompose it into several domains or sub-problems, and to simulate them in a decoupled way. To provide its cosimulation capabilities, we based PEGASE on two main components. The first one is a framework for integrating simulation models, which can be either compatible with the FMI standard or interfaced through an Application Programming Interface (API). The second one is a multi-threaded sequencer enabling several simulation sequences with different time steps. To provide advanced control capabilities, we also equipped PEGASE with a framework for MPC combining a comprehensive management of predictions data and a modeler dedicated to the formulation of Mixed Integer Linear Programs. We implemented this framework in C++ providing low formulation and resolution times for typical applications. Connection to hardware is also available via standard industry protocols thereby allowing PEGASE to control real energy systems. In this paper, we show how these basic functionalities, combined with dedicated modeling tools, enable setting up simulation and control applications suitable for tackling the complexity of various kinds of energy systems. To illustrate this, we present four application examples from our recent research work. These examples cover several domains, from concentrated solar thermal plants to optimal control of district heating networks. The variety of examples demonstrates the robustness and genericity of the approach.

### Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID
**Authors**: Dongsheng Wang, Yuxi Huang, Shen Gao, Yifan Wang, Chengrui Huang, Shuo Shang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:33:31Z

**Summary**: Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems aim to predict the next destinations of user based on their preferences and historical check-ins. Existing generative POI recommendation methods usually employ random numeric IDs for POIs, limiting the ability to model semantic relationships between similar locations. In this paper, we propose Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID (GNPR-SID), an LLM-based POI recommendation model with a novel semantic POI ID (SID) representation method that enhances the semantic understanding of POI modeling. There are two key components in our GNPR-SID: (1) a Semantic ID Construction module that generates semantically rich POI IDs based on semantic and collaborative features, and (2) a Generative POI Recommendation module that fine-tunes LLMs to predict the next POI using these semantic IDs. By incorporating user interaction patterns and POI semantic features into the semantic ID generation, our method improves the recommendation accuracy and generalization of the model. To construct semantically related SIDs, we propose a POI quantization method based on residual quantized variational autoencoder, which maps POIs into a discrete semantic space. We also propose a diversity loss to ensure that SIDs are uniformly distributed across the semantic space. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNPR-SID substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in recommendation accuracy.

**Authors**: Yanxu Mao, Tiehan Cui, Peipei Liu, Datao You, Hongsong Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:33:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.

**Authors**: Surya Jasper, Minh Luu, Evan Pan, Aakash Tyagi, Michael Quinn, Jiang Hu, David Kebo Houngninou

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:29:15Z

**Summary**: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

**Authors**: Wanzhe Wang, Jianqiu Peng, Menghao Hu, Weihuang Zhong, Tong Zhang, Shuai Wang, Yixin Zhang, Mingjie Shao, Wanli Ni

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:28:22Z

**Summary**: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

### Robust Instant Policy: Leveraging Student's t-Regression Model for   Robust In-context Imitation Learning of Robot Manipulation
**Authors**: Hanbit Oh, Andrea M. Salcedo-Vázquez, Ixchel G. Ramirez-Alpizar, Yukiyasu Domae

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:02:06Z

**Summary**: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

### ALPS: Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy for Efficient   Alignment of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hao Chen, Haoze Li, Zhiqing Xiao, Lirong Gao, Qi Zhang, Xiaomeng Hu, Ningtao Wang, Xing Fu, Junbo Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:56:01Z

**Summary**: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks often incurs significant training adjustment costs. Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy (ALPS), an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only 10% of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a 2% performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment. The code is available at https://github.com/VoiceBeer/ALPS.

### eLLM: Elastic Memory Management Framework for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Jiale Xu, Rui Zhang, Yi Xiong, Cong Guo, Zihan Liu, Yangjie Zhou, Weiming Hu, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Yongjie Yuan, Junping Zhao, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:56:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.   To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

### YOLO-MARL: You Only LLM Once for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yuan Zhuang, Yi Shen, Zhili Zhang, Yuxiao Chen, Fei Miao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:02:03Z

**Summary**: Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms.

### HetGCoT: Heterogeneous Graph-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought LLM Reasoning for   Academic Question Answering
**Authors**: Runsong Jia, Mengjia Wu, Ying Ding, Jie Lu, Yi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T04:51:45Z

**Summary**: Academic question answering (QA) in heterogeneous scholarly networks presents unique challenges requiring both structural understanding and interpretable reasoning. While graph neural networks (GNNs) capture structured graph information and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in semantic comprehension, current approaches lack integration at the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT, a framework enabling LLMs to effectively leverage and learn information from graphs to reason interpretable academic QA results. Our framework introduces three technical contributions: (1) a framework that transforms heterogeneous graph structural information into LLM-processable reasoning chains, (2) an adaptive metapath selection mechanism identifying relevant subgraphs for specific queries, and (3) a multi-step reasoning strategy systematically incorporating graph contexts into the reasoning process. Experiments on OpenAlex and DBLP datasets show our approach outperforms all sota baselines. The framework demonstrates adaptability across different LLM architectures and applicability to various scholarly question answering tasks.

### BriefMe: A Legal NLP Benchmark for Assisting with Legal Briefs
**Authors**: Jesse Woo, Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Ana Marasović, Kenneth Marino

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T06:35:29Z

**Summary**: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges. To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases. We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will specifically aid people in performing legal work.
